Is there a greater reason that I exist than just having to exist? Considering all the beings in this world (Gods, Titans, monsters, Chaos) it's hard not to feel like a lowly ant living among giants. How can I make sure my existence here is not wasted?\n\nMany have tried, many have failed, but many have also succeeded. Hercules, Perseus, Theseus, these are just names of some who were challenged and were rewarded with the gift of immortality. Their names would be remembered forever. How did they do it? How can I be like them?\n\n\"You need a purpose,\" a voice in my head said.\n\nI suppose that you're right! A fulfilled purpose is enough to suffice a confused heart, giving it the feeling like it fulfilled the reason for its existence, too. But what shall be my purpose?\n\n\"Serve me...\" the voice answered, \"You must serve me, my son...\"\n\nOf course, I knew that this voice belonged to my father even before he revealed it so. The natural superiority and hardness in his voice proved that. But is that really just what I'm good for? Just an unworthy servant...? I banished the thought.\n\n\"Father, I only exist to serve you,\" I answered the voice. Though my world is unfortunately huge, so is the length of my mortal life. Who knows what feats I will be able to accomplish by the end of it?\n\nAfter all, it doesn't hurt that my Father, the one who answers my prayers every now and then, is Zeus, the Lord of the Gods and the Ruler of the Sky.

Ever so slightly, I let some light pass my guarded eyes and look at my surroundings.\n\nI've been lying down in a field of grass and it's morning. Apollo has only begun his day-long trek in his golden, shining chariot from east to west. The sunlight is what interrupted my peaceful slumber. Curse it!\n\nSuddenly, with my trained senses, I heard grass being stepped on. In that moment, all my battle senses that I gained from training were turned on. The steps are scattered, possibly caused by multiple creatures or a single animosity with multiple legs. I froze my body thinking maybe the monster would lower its guard when it thinks that I'm still unaware of its presence. The smell of sweat and blood filled the air. Clearly, the creature just had its meal.\n\nUsing expert caution, I unsheathed my sword very quietly while still on the floor. The blade emits a faint glow, the power of the sky, being in the blade, made its presence known.\n\nI felt nervous, my heart pounding and my blood rushing, but never afraid. My mind was calculating everything in sight but I still don't know what creature I'm dealing with. Could be an army of wolves or a giant Arachne, who knows?\n\nThe steps grew closer, then stopped.

My sword felt perfectly balanced in my well-rested arms. My brain draws out about 20 different tactics on how I can maneuver in case the creatures used any tricks. All these happened in a manner of seconds. But, what stood before me didn't look like they wanted a fight.\n\nA large group of men, women and children stood in the grassy plains. They looked dirty and tired like they came here from a faraway place. They also looked sad, most of the women seemed afraid of me. This made me put away my sword.\n\nA bearded man, who seemed to be their leader, intones, \"We came all the way from our village of Cione, which lies by the great mountain of Etna.\"\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" I asked, \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"We're here seeking refuge,\" the bearded man answered, \"A horrible monster terrorized our village and destroyed our homes.\"\n\nAn idea sprung from the top of my head. \"I live in a village named Mene.

He's frail and old, there was no way he could defend all his people from anything stronger than a pack of wolves. With the clothing he wore, you would never think he was royalty. A dirty toga with scattered rips slung loosely across his body. He had grayish hair and beard and his eyes resonated nothing but sadness.\n\n\"Worry not, you're in safe hands now,\" I assured King Percix, \"but would you describe this giant for me? I have fought a lot of them before and I might be able to help.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Learn about the Giant", "result": "King Percix's face turned dark and grim.

I scolded myself quietly, wondering why I hadn't heard the sound earlier, maybe it was because I was so drawn to the King's description of the monster. Rustling sounds are coming from the trees which surrounded our weary group of refugees.\n\nMoments passed, and the sounds evolved into movement in the plantlife. There are something out there. I drew my sword. It's warm glow seemed to thin the now-heavy fog of the forest. I held my breath waiting for something to happen.\n\nAt the sight of my sword, some of the children wimpered and ran to their mothers. I couldn't blame them. From the sounds, it's clear there are a lot of creatures out there and they aren't human.\n\nI turned to the King. He was looking at the trees and says, \"Not again---\"\n\nAn explosion from the trees interrupted him again. I was somewhat wrong. The creatures are somewhat humanoid in a sense. They were huge, the smallest probably standing at seven feet high. All they had on were pieces of cloth strapped to their waists. There were three of them with greenish skin and muscled bodies. Their eyes looked at everyone at first. Then after seeing my drawn sword, they focused on me. Without question, I know that we've been ambushed by a pack of giants.\n\nTell them:", "action_results": [{"action": "\"You ugly beasts! Come and get me!\"", "result": "\"YOU DUMB BRUTES! IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, YOU WOULD STOP WHERE YOU ARE!\" I yelled.\n\nThe giants laughed a stupid man's laugh. Percix looked at me like I was crazy, but I kept my eyes on the giant bandits, my sword starting to feel heavier.\n\n\"FOOLISH HUMAN!\" the biggest of the bandits yelled back, \"WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?\"\n\nI summoned all the authority in my voice and yelled back as loudly as I could, \"I AM GAIUS, THE HERO OF MENE AND THE SON OF MY FATHER, ZEUS!\" Thunder rumbled in the skies and the clouds turned gray in a manner of seconds.

The bigger giant, clearly the strongest in the group, kept his grin and his eyes on me. I tried my best not to show my fear and I did it by returning his gaze straight at him.\n\nThen, he broke his statue-form and turned to his friends. He growled two words to them, \"Get him!\"\n\nI was prepared for the attack. The two stupid giants obeyed their leader's command and charged at me at the same time. I waited for the right moment and jumped ten feet in the air. The giants realized their mistake a little late and hit each other head on with a full force enough to cause an earthquake.\n\nMeanwhile, I used my power over the winds and hurled myself downward towards the now-unconscious bodies of the two giants with my sword pointing at them. The impact was so severe that it sent out a shockwave that was probably felt by everyone within a 50 yard radius. Blood and giant entrails scattered across the forest floor. The impact caused a fog of dust that hid myself from the others.\n\nWhen the fog clears, I saw myself towering over the two corpses. My sword is stuck inside what seems to be the head of one of the giants but it was so decimated that I couldn't be sure.\n\nI pulled my sword out and saw for the first time the reaction of the last giant. His smile left his face altogether and was replaced by a surprised, opened mouth. I jumped off the tower I just created and locked my gaze at him again.\n\n\"Let's get this over with!\" I said pretending like the stunt that I did hadn't caused me as much energy as it did.", "action_results": [{"action": "Final Round", "result": "The giant roared so loud it shook the trees nearby.

Clearly, he's not as dim-witted as his friends. The moment I tried to sidestep his charge, he stopped mid-stride and stepped toward the direction that I went. Even with the speed that I had, I couldn't entirely dodge his strike and he hit me in the back. I heard bones cracking as his attack glanced at me.\n\nI tried to stand up but the pain prevented me. I was only able to crouch, now. Realizing that he probably won, the giant towered above me. He raised his club, as if to end the battle, but I had other plans.\n\nThe seconds seemed like minutes and I concentrated as hard as I could before the giant could make his final move. Then, there was an aura of calmness that enveloped the forest.\n\nThe giant hesitated just a little bit and that was enough time that I needed to finish him off. I raised my sword and it glowed ever-so brightly toward the sky. The storm clouds gave birth to a thunderbolt that hit my sword killing everyone and everything within 5 feet around me.\n\nThe force disintegrated the last giant and I stood perfectly straight. My body healed after the thunderbolt hit, a blessing that sons of Zeus often have. A sigh of relief escaped my mouth and I looked back.\n\nTo my surprise, the group looked even more scared than before. I couldn't blame them, even other demigods were amazed at the power that my Father granted me because he rarely give out as much.\n\nPercix broke the awkward silence, \"Praise Gaius, the Son of Zeus, our Savior!\" he shouted towards his people. Scattered cheers from the men rang through the forest, most of the woman still looked at me like I was worse than the giants.\n\n\"We should continue towards Mene,\" I said when the crowd quieted down, \"I'm not sure I could fight more of these things if we get attacked again.\"\n\nAnd with that our journey continued.", "action_results": [{"action": "To my Home", "result": "I breathed in the smell of fresh air.

They pointed me to the familiar house and I went in.\n\nMy mother was the only one in the village who hadn't changed a bit. Her eyes still had that welcoming gesture she made it seem like I was just gone for a couple of days. The inside of our house looked the same, too.

You just came back, why not rest for a day?\" I expected this sort of response from my Mother and told her that I'm fine and that Typhon might start attacking other nearby villages.

The hills looked as if a God was digging up the ground searching for something. And, with my luck, that's probably how the hills were formed anyway. Mounds of dark brown dirt formed ridges that looked like the waves of the sea. The air smelled of dirt plus the occasional sea breeze coming from the nearby shore.\n\nI drew closer to the dirt hills and started to see the signs.\n\nThere were crude, man-made signs strewn across the entrance to the hills. They all say the same thing: \"Turn Back, Beware the Monster.\" Well, that's good advice if you're an ordinary mortal. My horse, whom I named Pegasus, was tired. I had a feeling that with his old age he wouldn't actually complete the quest with me. I decided to take off his harness and let him go.\n\nNow on foot, I went up the first mound of dirt.

Feeling good about myself, I still felt guilty of destroying a small of part of the forest.\n\nWood nymphs started running away in groups the moment the first 20 foot tall tree went down. But, if Typhon is really going to be destroying Mene, next, there's no question that he would destroy the whole forest. The forest should actually thank me, for what I've done and what I'm going to do.\n\nShaking myself off of exhaustion and sweat, I looked northwards. There's no doubt Typhon heard the disturbance in the forest. I wouldn't be surprised if he's planning an ambush for me right now. He would have to do better though, because my skills have certainly gotten a lot better as well.", "action_results": [{"action": "Let's get to the action already", "result": "The village has been destroyed.\n\nI made my way out of the forest and started looking for the village. It took me a moment to realize, that there is no more village. Cione laid in ruins at the feet of the biggest giant I have ever seen.\n\nThe stories were wrong, as far as I was concerned. This giant is more deadly, and more terrifying than from what they told.\n\nTyphon's dragon wings are gargantuan. I imagine a wingspan of about two miles. His body is surrounded by a huge tornado engulfing nearby ruined buildings and turning them to dust. I crane my neck all the way up to see his yellow-toothed grin and red glowing eyes looking straight at me. I probably looked like an ant from his view.\n\n\"After years of destroying hundreds of cities,\" he said with a voice that sounded like violent storm winds, \"Zeus sends a lowly mortal to fight me! YOU COWARD! FIGHT ME YOURSELF!\"\n\n\"MY FATHER DOESN'T NEED TO WASTE HIS TIME WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU!\" I yelled louder than I ever had. Still, I thought there was no way he could've heard me.\n\n\"Ah, so the demigod wants to fight with words first,\" he smiled, \"Well, I am Typhon, the legendary destroyer of Gods, a tiny human such as yourself will never stand a chance!\"", "action_results": [{"action": "\"Father, help me!\"", "result": "I prayed for my father. \"Father, I need more power.\"\n\nI'm sorry, son, but the power you need can't just be given to you, he replied.

This is my life's purpose, to make a name for myself, and I won't get it if I get killed here.\"\n\nI didn't hear him again but the feeling of becoming a God was painful. It was like absorbing all the power in the world inside my human body. I knew that if I give in just a little bit to the power it would consume for good. Trying hard not to die, I concentrated on my Mother and Percix, the very people I've been trying hard to save.\n\nMere seconds seemed like days to me. Then, finally, it stopped. I searched through my memories, they are all still there. I'm still Gaius, but now I'm not Gaius anymore.\n\n\"MY NAME IS GAIUS, THE PRINCE OF THE HEAVENS AND VANQUISHER OF MY FATHER'S ENEMIES,\" I said with a really different, really powerful voice. I felt the power settling under my skin, my body just barely keeping from exploding from the inside. I concentrated on my power and in minutes I was surrounded by a powerful tornado, just about the same size as Typhon's.\n\n\"What is this?\" Typhon asked, I detected a little hint of fear that showed in his disgusting face, \"He turned you into one of them?\" Then, he burst out laughing.\n\nEarlier, the laughter would have scared me for the sheer volume of it.

Now, though, the sky glowed darkness. It was like the makings of a huge storm. I sensed tornadoes forming around both me and Typhon.\n\nTyphon, surprised by the sudden attack, stopped his laughter short.

Typhon swung his arm upward with me still on it. Then, using the upward force of his swing, I removed my sword from his hand. For a moment, my body flew upwards without me having to use my powers over the winds. I soared past Typhon's head.\n\nThen, with all my might, I willed the winds to push me straight down towards the giant's chest.\n\nI willed the winds to propel me faster and they obeyed.

I dodged them easily.\n\nI was amazed at the power that I possess now that I'm a God. I would test my limits more if only Typhon would surrender . . . I perish the thought. There's no way this giant would surrender to me.\n\nWell, that means there's only one way to stop this.\n\nI kept on flying until we reached the sea. Looking behind, I saw Typhon getting more tired as I dragged on the chase.\n\nSuddenly, I willed the winds to take me up. Typhon, noticing my change of altitude, decided to get a better height as well. The plan is working perfectly. The farther he seemed to get from his mother, the Earth, the weaker he gets. And, the higher I get in the skies, the stronger I felt.\n\nI rose until I was sure that I have enough time to deal the final blow. I concentrated on the skies.

In my mind, I shaped the biggest and the most powerful lightning bolt I could muster.\n\nI waited until the right millisecond and unleashed the power. What I did was hard to explain. The best I could come up with is that I rode the lightning bolt. I aimed the bolt to hit me, directly, and when it connected, the force generated shot me straight down to Typhon's rising figure.\n\nI pointed my sword straight at him going as fast as a lightning bolt. The impact was so severe that I didn't even felt it when my sword impaled Typhon right in the chest.\n\nWe barreled straight to the ocean, the giant roars of pain made my ears deaf from everything else. I felt the sea stopped our descent. The water around Typhon's unconscious body is turning gold with Ichor. I waited for something else to happen, but there are no dirt to heal his wounds.

The silence gave way to more hearing. I didn't like what I heard.\n\nI expected hearing the rustling and the voices from my village of Mene, which is just up ahead. There was nothing in the air, only the mystery of the silence.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, I stood in front of Mene.
