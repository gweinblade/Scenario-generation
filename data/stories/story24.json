This time, there were no rewards on the other side. Just horror, and terror, and nights of fear. I only slept when I absolutely had to.\n\nIt was the same thing every time. The sand was burning. The sun was scorching. I was in the middle of it all. Then, from within the chaos, a monster. It emerged from the flames, gold specks settling on its head like the crown of a victor. Fitting, because the beast always won. Perhaps it was not the appearance of the beast that unsettled me. It usually changed - sometimes the same, sometimes different. When I thought about it, it was not that scary. But in my mind, it was, and that was enough for the fear to enter my veins. \n\nI stumbled, and ran.

And I could not even run fast enough. I turned away, not wanting to look at my hands. They were horrifying - decaying meat on a milky white skeleton. A warning of what I could be.\n\nThe surface of the lake rippled, and I quickly leapt back. They were here. Failure was the leader - a dark, miserable version of me that I could not bear to face. Evil was pretty bad too, with his nasty, malicious grin and bloodshot eyes. As for Fear, he was the worst. He constantly reminded me of what a coward I was, being unable to face the fear that was my nightmares. These were all versions of me, doomed to haunt my dreams every night.

It was stupid to delay the inevitable. But my fight or flight response kicked it, and even the rational part of my mind decided I should run. While it was just a dream, getting torn apart by the monster was no fun. The excruciating pain was not triggered by my nerves, but when I could see it so clearly in my mind's eye, my brain needed no help in filling in the gaps. The blood. The plea of help. The feeling that the world was doomed and desolate... because it was. At least, this world of my nightmare was.\n\nThat was what I thought.\n\nPerhaps it was not empty as long as I was there.

It was childish, but I couldn't resist. \u2018Killer of dreams. We make your nightmares a reality.' Yet, I knew that if my actual nightmare came through, the world was more than over.\n\nYears ago, eyes wide and bright, I entered this very same building. I was an hour early, my suit picked up two weeks in advance, and was going through notes to potential questions. In that time of naivety and being blinded by illusions of grandeur, I believed that this was the place where my dreams could come true. Now I knew that could not be further from the truth.\n\nWearing a day old crumpled collar shirt and stained black trousers, I headed to the desk of doom. The same desk I had been sitting at for years. I had once asked for a promotion, but the boss\u2019s outrageous laughter and looks of cynicism told me all I needed to know. No one had been promoted for over three years now.

Guess this talk was really boring. That was not much of a surprise, given that Reeter always gave me the worst jobs possible. I took my seat at the side, near the door and secluded from the rest of the audience. Somehow, with the company's stingy spending habits, that was the only spot in the auditorium where the acoustics were actually decent.\n\nWith my laptop ready, I began listening to the speech. The speaker was a middle aged man, with a beard shaped like a...crescent moon? I was not sure, a tall member of the audience obscured my view of the stage.\n\n\"Righty-ho! You're here to hear about dreams, huh? I mean, that's what this company's built upon. Now, you! What was the craziest dream you've had?\"\n\nFrom the halfhearted mutters, I could already tell that his upbeat attitude did not sit well with the audience.\n\n\"Anyhow, moving on, I'm sure you lot have already heard loads about lucid dreaming, and the sleep cycle, and stuff like that. Nope, I'm not here to bore you that way. Well, my colleague was, then he got sick last minute... eh, life happens. But more often, dreams happen. And I'm here to tell you about that. Ever heard of the jungle metaphor?\"\n\nJudging from the confused stares and bewildered voices, I realized that nobody had a clue. I hastily scribbled it down - 'The Jungle metaphor'.\n\n\"We know how jungles work - tough competition, full of unsuspected dangers and venomous vipers. Yet, we know what else they offer - natural resources, beautiful sceneries, and a sense of pride when we escape. It has been used to describe work, to describe life, but I'm going to use it to describe dreams.\n\nFirst off, the easy stage. Just like the sleep cycle, just like the first level of a game, it starts off relatively easy. Not too many thorns, the trees provide shelter and the path is clear. We begin by getting used to the atmosphere, the surrounding... it's a change of pace.\n\nThen, we come into the next part. It gets a little more challenging, but requires us to use the skills we've learnt. The dream gets a little deeper, a little scarier... for the aspiring writers, it's like building up suspense in a story. Applying newfound knowledge, and acquiring more.\"\n\nBy now, most of the audience began to drift off. Yet the strange man persisted, and I had the strangest feeling that his speech was directed at me.\n\n\"The third part is the... darkest. It can be considered the climax of a dream, and for some, is the worst. If you suffer from nightmares, this would be the part in which you'll be torn apart over and over again. Most people wake up by this point.\n\nNext, things may seem just slightly easier. But beware, because the night has brought changes, Everything that was learnt and explored earlier would change. A plot twist, if you will. A surprise in good dreams, where you'll feel a little happier. Yet it is easily the most confusing part.\n\nAt this point, most people think the dream is over. But that's only because they forget about the rest of it. Even if they remember, they'll prefer to forget. It plays on sadness, on feeling dull. A melancholy that nothing can feel. The lucky ones simply get off with feeling empty before waking up.\n\nLastly, and bear with me as the speech's almost over, everything turns black. By that, I mean I have no idea what happens. Scientists have detected unusual activity in the brain just before subjects wake up. Perhaps one day we'll find out, perhaps not. Now, away to freedom! This speech is concluded.\"\n\nI immediately left the room, slightly relieved. The speech made me feel all strange, as if there was something I was supposed to know but didn't. Something important.

The 'dream team' indeed. \n\nA voice broke me from my reverie. \"WHY, IF IT ISN'T LUKE DRAMER! I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LOOK THIS AWAKE BEFORE. YOUR EYES DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU WERE IN A FIGHT FOR ONCE.

Wasn't there just sun, and sand, and the pond...", "result": "I scrutinised the darkness, wondering what happened to the previous scenery. Somehow, this made my consciousness grow. Not enough for me to wake up - it required 8 consciousness points to do that - but enough for me to be aware that I was dreaming. I probably had 5 to 6 points... and with no explanation of how that happened. Or how I knew that. I dismissed it as another of the random things that happens in dreams... until I saw the fabric fold. \n\n#Gained a new dreampower: Perception\n\nThe darkness all around me seemed to stretch out for miles, but a little bit of evidence told me otherwise. There was a tiny hole where I could make out... the bottom of a ladder? I inched closer, ignoring the monster behind me. It hated being ignored and snarled, yet your curiosity had overtaken my fear. \n\n\u201cEnough.\u201d Somehow, the discovery made me braver. I was no longer afraid of it - there were other things to do. \n\nOnce I reached the hole, I peered through. Sure enough, there was a ladder. It was so long I had to crane my neck just to see it, and I considered myself to be on the tall side. On the ladder stood a very tall man, adjusting a knob on what looked like a gigantic torchlight. The torch\u2019s light was shined into a completely black box... the box I was in only a short while ago.  Then I heard a gasp, and turned around. A young woman looked at me in shock, her eyes wide. She dropped all the files and paper in hand, and yelled out the strangest battle cry.\n\n\u201cKill the lights!\u201d\n\nThen it all went dark. I awoke, wondering whether this meant the nightmares were over. Instead, a mystery had taken its place.", "action_results": [null, null]}]}]}]}
