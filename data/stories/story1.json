A heap of blankets covered her body, leaving only her face exposed. Her eyes sparkled under the warm glow of the hearth\u2019s fire. The winter blizzards that raged outside their cozy abode made the bolts and screws of their dangly door rattle. Still, the howling winds didn\u2019t faze the brother as much. Heavy snowfall like this was a common occurrence in the city. He peeked outside the tiny hole of the door. It seemed that night had already settled in as he saw the last slivers of the sun touch the rooftops of the opposite street. After the sixth bell, his father and mother would come home from work. \n\n\n\n\nHe ignored his little sister\u2019s pleads. There was still much to do before their arrival. The fire needed to be watched over, the winter handiwork of the day had to be finished and he needed to start chopping the vegetables for the stew. He wanted to start finishing up these tasks when he was released at the fifth bell, but the foreman didn\u2019t let him go home early. Apparently the carpentry workshop had yet to finish the last-minute orders of the merchant that passed through a week ago.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHis little sister sure was persistent. He sighed and knelt down.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd your basket weaving?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nShe furrowed her brows before scurrying to the storage room. When she came back a crudely made basket was placed in his hands. He tugged at it to see if it held up together. To his surprise, it seemed to be sturdy enough to sell for one Fistel coin. He sighed. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cFine, put out the lamp before we waste anymore oil.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAt least she listened this time. When their parents were at home, she would be the sweetest little ray of sunshine. Only he knew how much of a headache she could be. She ignored his exasperated sighs and scooted over where he sat. The fire behind them warmed their backs.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis time it will be a quick one, so listen carefully.\u201d He said. \n\n\n\n\nHis finger pointed straight at her nose. He quickly continued in an attempt to avoid her voicing her protests. It was better to keep her mouth shut from the very beginning lest he wanted her to interrupt him constantly.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the story of the last king.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nShe tilted her head. \u201cLast king? Do you mean-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the one they tell you during your baptism.\u201d He cleared his throat.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCan you not tell me one of mum\u2019s stories?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe sent a glare straight to her. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou asked me right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFine, tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAt last he could begin.  \n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "\u201cSo Imagine that you were the last king named uhh.. what was his name again\u2026.ah yeah\u2026Henrik!\u201d", "result": "The study was as chilly as the snow covered plains outside the palace. Still, you heard the thundering vibrations of the cannons and firearms that were fired off by your guards. The city was now in full anarchy for several days now. You didn\u2019t want to know how many have perished as you mulled over the stack of paper work. Not many were allowed to go in your room, especially in grave times like these. \n\n\n\n\nLast week there had been a cook that had sprinkled some poison in your tea and in the more distant past you remembered that you had to relieve some of your guards from their duty after a security breach. Thus, only two people were now in the study beside you. Your most trusted guard Eckhart rested his back against the door. All color had drained from his face, leaving behind only a pasty complexion and dark blue circles under his eyes. His hands gripped tightly to his rifle. Your advisor Fulke who stood next to your desk was not in a much better shape as he tried to calm down his tremor. After that incident from last week, he refused to eat more than a few biscuits. \n\n\n\n\nYou turned to Fulke after you had read the last letters and drily asked him. \u201cHow should we proceed?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHis eyes widened while he covered his mouth. He lightly shook his head before averting his gaze.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have several options, but ultimately they have to be made before the sun rises. The insurrectionists\u2019 representatives will arrive at dawn. I myself\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, he wanted to say that the choice was up to you to make. The fate of this nation lied solely in your hands. It would be too much of a burden to place it on a single advisor, no matter how competent he may be. \n\n\n\n\nYou then shifted your eyes to Eckhart who had until now chosen to remain silent. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you read their demands too?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe curtly nodded. His words were spoken softer than whispers. \u201cA democracy, a ruler chosen not by the decree of the gods. I don\u2019t know what has befallen those souls. Utter heresy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke lowered his eyes to mask his grimace at Eckhart\u2019s remark. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of public support for such ideas as far as my assistants have told me whenever they visit the parlor rooms. It would be difficult to quell these concepts once they have propagated under the populace. Perhaps a peaceful solution may be more effective.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nA vein bulged out of Eckhart\u2019s head. His stony face shifted into something more resembling a glare. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you wish for the gods to strike us down?\u201d He said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you have the soft hands of a coward, Fulke.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not talking about a spar or the outcome of a physical brawl, but the life of our liege.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke put extra emphasis on the last words as his eyes narrowed. In the corner of your eyes you already could see Eckhart\u2019s hands balling into fists to measure the time needed to reach Fulke's nose. Tension in the room thickened with each passing second. \n\nJust before Eckhart reached out to Fulke, you slammed your hand on your desk. Both were visibly startled by your lowered voice. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou two, leave.\u201d You said. \u201cI will give you my answer before dawn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAs a trained guard would do, Eckhart immediately left without protest though he shot a worrying glance at you before he closed the door to wait outside. Fulke expressed more of his reluctance, but one more nod from you had convinced him to leave you alone for now. \n\n\n\n\nAs their presence left the room, you slumped against your chair. So it had all come down to this very moment? Although your father had warned you about many things like the different noble factions vying for the royal family\u2019s favor, the increased tension in the borders shared with Essenschaft or the high bishop whose wrath must not be gained. Despite your father's vast knowledge and the various documents in the palace\u2019s library, there was no one right answer you could think of. \n\n\n\n\nWhile the candle\u2019s light grew ever brighter under the setting sun, your thoughts slowly wandered off to the past as you desperately tried to search for the path you could walk on.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Your first time leading a group", "result": "You peered through the window. The budding leaves and flowers of the trees and bushes of the courtyard all showed the end of the cold winter and the beginning of the new year. The gods\u2019 yearly awakening and arrival to the earthly realm to lavish the lands with fruitful blessings, always marked the return of spring. \n\n\n\n\nYou yourself were too brimming with excitement, knowing that this was the first time you were allowed to attend a social gathering. You were a little disappointed that this one was not organized by your parents, but by your uncle, the army's commander. \n\n\n\n\nYour milk brother Eckhart had attended several last year and the year before after his social debut and had bragged about the sweets they served during these tea parties. He also paraded around the brooch and embroidered cape his mother had given him for his baptism as if his family crest was so much more special than the other ones. You made sure to remind him every time that your parents will give you an even better one, but then Eckhart brought up the sweets again. In a fit of jealousy you begged your nannies to also let you participate in these tea parties, but they all said you had to wait until you had been baptized. \n\n\n\n\nYou puffed out your chest, temporarily forgoing any manners your caretakers had taught you and ran out of your room, traversed through several hallways to almost enter the courtyard before you were pulled aside by none other than Eckhart. It was odd to see his hair all slicked up and to see him wearing his tailed coat, but the familiar short sword that was slung against his hips calmed your nerves.\n\n\n\n\nHis panicked expression quickly turned sour as he started to glare at you. In his still high-pitched voice that was perhaps a little too loud for your taste, he shouted.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThink a little more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt was strange coming from a muscle head like Eckhart. Seeing that even your wet nurse had complained about his empty head and reluctance to put what little he had into proper use during his studies, you couldn\u2019t help but be slightly stunned as he lectured you about the dangers of walking without any retainers and the supposed social blunder you almost made by not letting Eckhart accompany you. \n\n\n\n\nHe was already acting so weird during your baptism ceremony when he started to not call you by your given name in public anymore. The long oath he swore to you made you even more uncomfortable the longer you thought about it. You could only imagine Eckhart\u2019s grueling study sessions with your wet nurse.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this information Eckhart had blabbered to you went one ear in and one ear out. You knew he was right, but a stubborn side of you didn\u2019t want him to know that. Thus, you nodded halfheartedly as he insisted on walking behind you. It was sometimes quite difficult to fathom that Eckart, the one who had been your playmate ever since you were born and who was only two years older than you, was now assigned as your apprentice guard. \n\n\n\n\nWhen you arrived at the gathering, you couldn\u2019t help but freeze up after you saw so many eyes paying attention to every breath you took. Although you could vaguely remember some of their faces as they had also witnessed your baptism, you were utterly unfamiliar with the majority of the nobles who lined up to greet you one by one. At first the adults from the higher duchies stepped forward, followed by the lower ranked ones. After you had sent off the last baron, it was the children\u2019s turn. Boys and girls, some taller and some even smaller than you, lowered their heads before you. Eckhart didn\u2019t seem to be that bothered by the avalanche of new faces. His gaze had wandered off to the duke of Cassisheit and his daughter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as your smile wavered, Eckhart prodded your sides. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThink about the sweets.\u201d He mouthed at you. \n\n\n\n\nWith his very convincing words in mind, you plastered a polite smile on your face as you finished your greetings. However, the sweets were not yet within your grasp. A band of other children forced you to forfeit your quest for now. Their twinkling eyes looked at you while they gripped tightly to their wooden swords. Although you had every authority to refuse, Eckhart shot you a menacing smile while his grip on your shoulder tightened. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe prince is elated to give his permission for this small bout.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou glanced back at him. He really did put words in your mouth. When you were about to protest, he gave you a look that made you swallow your thoughts all too readily. Your parents did emphasize that a person from your standing needed to assert their presence one way or the other, but you weren\u2019t sure that a sparring match was the proper way to do so. You weren\u2019t really afraid of Eckhart losing his honor in a humiliating defeat, but his participation would leave you without any guards. You weren\u2019t exactly keen to earn the wrath of your caretakers. While you mulled over the underlying benefits of letting Eckhart spar, the boy himself continued to stare intensely in the direction of the duke of Cassisheit. \n\n\n\n\nAfter some pondering you sighed in your head. Whenever Eckhart had that glimmer in his eyes, you knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back. Even if you tried to stop him, he would sulk about it for at least a day or two. \n\n\n\n\nYou locked your eyes on the children you will surely grow more familiar with in the upcoming years. They were the future dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons. Your father did say that you ought to be polite to them. He did tell you the reason, but you forgot the very day he had told you. It was too much of a headache to remember. You hadn\u2019t bothered to ask Eckhart, because he too would probably not know. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy trusted retainer will be sent out with my blessing.\u201d You said.  \n\n\n\n\nEckhart relinquished his grip and ran to the open patch of ground at the upper right corner of the courtyard beyond the small patios where the adults were gathered. \n\n\n\n\nLow and behold, the first challenger, a boy, one year his senior and carrying the emblem of Cassisheit, was defeated within a few moves. In the beginning he may have had the upper hand and the sand throwing was indeed interesting to see, but Eckhart\u2019s raw talent and trained skill was not something to take lightly. Unlike the group of children gathered around the sparring pair, his eyes were trained on the duke of Cassisheit. \n\n\n\n\nYou tilted your head. Was he so eager to curry the duke\u2019s favor despite him being your retainer?\n\n\n\n\nAfter you announced the Eckhart\u2019s victory, the next challenger had arrived. It was a boy about your age. Like the other children, his family crest was embroidered on his cape, but you couldn\u2019t exactly place the name to any family you knew of. Looking at the widened eyes of the other children, you would guess that his choice to participate was a rather unconventional one. The most noticeable physical feature he had were his long gangly limbs. He lowered his head while he stuttered out the following words. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, I would like to try too.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nEckhart\u2019s eyes narrowed the moment he saw the embroidered crest. A certain coldness you had never seen before flitted through his eyes. He huffed before he beckoned the boy to step into the makeshift arena. \n\n\n\n\nHe casually walked to his side of the circle and took on a stance you had seen before. All of a sudden his face shifted into a sneer. You then quickly shifted your attention to the new challenger, who was still fumbling around with his coat pockets. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cCan we use everything within our disposal?\u201d He timidly asked Eckhart.\n\n\n\n\nEckhart then glanced at you as he waited for your final verdict. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cEverything except the help of other people.\u201d You hurriedly added. \u201cOf course the use of bladed weapons and other tools which cause blood to spill or permanently maim the opponent are strictly forbidden.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nThe challenger gave you a timid smile and settled on his respective side of the arena. However, he still chose to stand around doing nothing without any apparent need to take up a stance or to ready an attack. Just as you were about to cringe at the sight of the upcoming slaughter, the quick turn of events made you gasp out of surprise. \n\n\n\n\nSeeing that the boy was planning on doing absolutely nothing, Eckhart charged head on. The moment his sword was about to strike the boy\u2019s chest, a bright flash of light shot out of the challenger\u2019s hand. During this small time span of weakness and confusion, the boy slammed his wooden sword right at the family\u2019s jewels. Soon you heard Eckhart\u2019s pained grunt after he fell on the ground in a fetal position. \n\n\n\n\nThe challenger\u2019s cheeks were fully flushed despite the cool spring weather. In his hand shimmered a mirror\u2019s shard against the bright sunlight. You rubbed your eyes to make sure that this sight was not a mere mirage. \n\n\n\n\nIndeed, the boy had won. \n\n\n\n\nJust as the others were about to slowly clap for his victory, Eckhart shot up, his eyes filled with rage. He kicked the boy on his shins repeatedly till the young challenger fell over. The boy tried to crawl away, but Eckhart grasped his hair to prevent his escape. You tilted your head after witnessing this peculiar event.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEckhart, what is the meaning of this? The bout has ended if I\u2019m correct.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe cheated.\u201d Eckhart spit these words out with fervor. \u201cHe has a lot of nerve for the son of a baron\u2019s second wife.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou carefully nodded and considered your next actions. Never in your life had you thought that a tea party would be such a headache. You only wanted to devour these sweets that were being displayed on the patios. Your caretakers never allowed you to indulge in them too much for fear of your health, but you could almost hear these crumbly butter cookies calling for you to taste them. \n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Let Eckhart strike the boy for his insolence.", "result": "Standings and knowing where one\u2019s place was, were one of the most crucial things in noble society. You knew exactly what Eckhart meant to say in his own roundabout way. You tilted your head. \n\n\n\n\nIf the boy was also the son of a duke\u2019s first wife like Eckhart, he would be applauded for his remarkable creative way of thinking. It was too bad that he was born of such a poor house. One had to know when to show your cards and when to hold back against a stronger foe. The boy should have never been allowed to participate in the first place and even if he got the opponent\u2019s permission, defeat was the only option to avoid the other noble\u2019s wrath. Alas, a dog eat dog world it was.\n\n\n\n\nThere was a reason why traditions were traditions in the first place. \n\n\n\n\nYou then looked at the adults who had all turned their attention to the makeshift arena. Apparently they too had noticed Eckhart\u2019s all too screeching scream. In the back of your mind you were relieved that your parents had been absent during this gathering. You spotted your uncle in the crowd who was donning a satisfied smirk while raising his brows. If you could say some words to butter him up, he might keep his mouth shut during his reports. Your father\u2019s and mother\u2019s lectures were not the most pleasant experience you could think of.\n\n\n\n\nIn the back of the crowd you could see the blood drained face of a nobleman whose cape carried the same embroidered family crest and color as the challenger. Based on his age, you guessed that this was probably the boy\u2019s father. His eyes were briefly locked into yours while he silently pleaded for your mercy. His son had quite a will of his own. \n\n\n\n\nYou shrugged and turned back to the two duelists.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEckhart, please continue where you have left off.\u201d You said while you put your hand on your cheek. \n\n\n\n\nEckhart\u2019s eyes twinkled with glee. He kicked the boy black and blue ignoring his tears and desperate pleas. After he was done, the baron\u2019s son could barely move. Some of the spectators tried to reach out, but quickly aborted their efforts when you glared at them. It would be foolish of them to intervene, as this action would go against your expressed orders. You didn\u2019t want to take care of another incident on the same day. If this went on like this, you would never be able to eat your sweets.\n\n\n\n\nA few of them looked at you in horror as if you were the one who had given such a cruel order. Well, it was technically you, because Eckhart was under your authority, but that didn\u2019t matter to you in the slightest. You crossed your arms. \n\n\n\n\nIt was Eckhart\u2019s fault for being such a meathead. \n\n\n\n\nStill you let Eckhart have his fun for a while. It had taken a surprisingly long time till he was fully satisfied. You nodded while you watched on. Perhaps this would be useful to keep in mind in the future. You placed your hand on your cheek after you heard another whimper coming from the boy. It would be a smart idea to report Eckhart\u2019s remarkable stamina to your father on your next meeting. \n\n\n\n\nAt last, when the boy stopped screaming, Eckhart ceased his attacks. He slumped backwards and gave you a satisfied smile. That bright expression on his face lasted for a few precious moments but as soon as you gave him that broad smile similar to the one your wet nurse always gave to you both whenever you two caused any sort of trouble, he winced. \n\n\n\n\nYour smile widened as you slowly cocked your head to your left. Eckhart knew what was waiting ahead of him in due time. \n\nYou then walked to the spot where the boy was lying on his back. It was almost pitiful to see him like this. To award him for his odd bravery while overlooking his suicidal stupidity, you fished out your handkerchief to dab away the blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth. His swollen eyes widened for a moment as you leant forward. Under the cover of the rumbling crowd, you managed to slip in a few words to him. He was lucky that he was not of age yet.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHmm.. you have caught my attention, but favor is hard to earn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou then beckoned Eckhart to join your side as you made way to the patio.

Although Eckhart did have a point regarding the gap between their social standings, he was the one who had accepted the boy\u2019s challenge. On top of that, he acted outside of your direct orders and against your own wishes.\n\n\n\n\nDidn\u2019t he know that this beating would only deplete your precious time where you could have eaten those delectable sweets?

If it was in a more private setting, you would have simply yelled at him and entered into a scuffle or two, but you weren\u2019t inside your quarters. Your father did say that punishment was necessary to discipline your retainers, but it always felt like such a chore to you. \n\n\n\n\nTension was released when Eckhart at last dropped his wooden sword and returned to your side.

The feeling of the sugar clumps melting on your tongue was something truly magical. \n\n\n\n\nJust as you were about to devour another cookie, you saw in the corner of your eyes the grateful smiles of two family members.\n\n\nThis warmth they shared, it felt quite a sight to behold.   \n\n\n ", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Your first time talking with your tutor", "result": "Your baptism seemed like such a long time ago and your first tea party too. Although you had initially been excited about the increased amount of people you were allowed to meet and especially the food they introduced to you, the novelty did wore off all too quickly. It was the same feeling you had with your tutors. Alas, you wished you were seven again, but even the gods couldn\u2019t reverse the deeds of the time weaver. These thirteen years couldn\u2019t easily be reversed.\n\n\n\n\nYour fingers lightly tapped on the desk. You heard a soft thud that could only come from Eckhart slamming his face on the wall. The summer heat and the stuffy room would probably be suffocating for such a hot headed individual like Eckhart, but you had a nagging feeling that this wasn\u2019t the sole reason. If you recalled correctly, Eckhart had been this way ever since his coming of age ceremony last spring. Since that day he had ceased to use his brain for anything useful. At least he had stopped talking about every minutia of the duchy of Cassisheit. \n\n\n\n\nYour wet nurse had once said to you that all of his nutrients went to his height, to which you reluctantly had to agree on. It was a miracle that he had managed to learn court etiquette at all or learnt how to read and write though his handwriting was admittedly still abysmal. If he would be so kind to offer some of this growth to you, you would have forgiven him for the hours of headaches you had to endure to parse out his scribbles that were supposed to resemble reports. \n\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only Eckhart who was in a rather foul mood, you also couldn\u2019t help but purse your lips as you waited for your tutor to come. In the past couple of weeks your parents were more busy than ever. After your baptism, you were graced with one shared meal every two days, but now all of your communication had to be done with letters. You played with the yellow brooch pinned on your cape. The gem placed inside its golden arches glimmered under the dim sunlight. The warmth of your hand heated the cold metal. You could almost feel two arms wrapped around you.\n\n\n\n\nThen you heard another loud thud followed by Eckart\u2019s whines. Although his voice had caught up with his growth spurt, it was still as loud as ever. His language did turn quite crude at the end too. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was finished, even learnt the stupid long god names, mum, you liar. University, why, why?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou two were soon interrupted by the turn of the doorknob and a soft knock.

Stray strands of his otherwise neatly slicked back hair, only made you more aware how much of a hurry these two were. Next to him stood a young boy around your age. His face seemed kind of familiar to you. Still, that didn\u2019t say a lot. As you had met so many people that you couldn\u2019t be bothered to know every noble\u2019s name let alone their children, you assumed that he would be some baron\u2019s child you had greeted during the many tea parties you had participated in.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cForgive me, your royal highness. We had some delays during our journey here.\u201d The tutor said. \n\n\n\n\nHe glared at the boy next to him who shrunk under his eyes. The boy stepped forward and bowed. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Fulke, Viscount Grunnenberg\u2019s assistant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou couldn\u2019t help but brighten your smile. Your wet nurse did inform you that Eckhart will soon have to prepare for the royal academy. An extra watchful eye would help him not to slack off. Although his arrival wasn\u2019t a surprise, you had expected this assistant to look more mature. The letter had told you that he would be a little older than Eckhart. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cEckhart will surely get along with you. He was also looking forward to this meeting and was quite eager to learn more about our country\u2019s illustrious history.\u201d You said. \u201cA lot of words of praise were spoken about you two.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke was now definitely hiding behind the tutor while his eyes kept quivering. You tilted your head. Perhaps a little too forceful? Eckhart didn\u2019t seem that bothered with what you had said as he was too busy longingly looking at the window. \n\n\n\n\nThe tutor coughed and went to take his seat next to your desk. Soon, the contents of his bag were displayed in front of you. An overflowing pile of papers and books were thrown almost haphazardly on your desk.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was notified that you are already aware of the origin story of our nation and our patron gods?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh yes, the eternal four gods, Lentetulp, Zummerin, Herafst and Schneeuwerik and the time weaver.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe tutor\u2019s eyes glimmered when you said their names without any hesitation. You could already see that he was testing your knowledge here. It would be quite amusing to see him shift his attention to Eckhart, but seeing that your poor guard had quite a rough time and was doing these puppy-dog eyes at you, you will take the limelight this time. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn another realm beyond our understanding where life was eternal and ever flowing, the time weaver remained the supreme god. He was a stern, but fair ruler of the land. However, his children, the eternal gods who were birthed out of his threads rebelled against him to overtake the throne. One fateful day, the four decided to poison the time weaver so that no more threads will be spun, but their attempt had failed.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cOut of anger, the time weaver sent these four children to the empty earthly realm to repent for their sins. He ordered them to fill the realm with the same splendor and life as the realm of the gods. If they succeeded, they will be allowed to come back home. So Lentetulp filled the world with blossoming flowers and animal life, Zummerin granted the trees with plenty of fruit, Herafst made the leaves ever so colorful and Schneeuwerik gave birth to the first humans.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter Herafst\u2019s blessings were given, the time weaver had called them home. The moment they followed his order, the earthly realm crumbled into ruin with deadly cold blizzards raging through the lands. Schneeuwerik, the youngest sibling and the apple of her father\u2019s eyes, begged the time weaver to let them return as she alone had grown quite fond of the earthly realm. The time weaver had to keep his word to his other three children, but he did want to grant her wish. Thus out of his love for Schneeuwerik, he unwound his threads again to reverse time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd so the seasons were born. Every time Herafst had finished her blessings, the time weaver unwound his thread to go back in time once again. The only thread that remained untouched was the thread of life that he had bestowed to the gentle and beautiful Schneeuwerik, the one that he had loved so dearly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOnce the story was finished you looked straight at the tutor. He stroke his chin with a neutral expression. Soon he rummaged through his papers to fish out a crudely drawn family tree and map. You closed your eyes and quickly rattled off the increasingly elaborate titles and names of your predecessors. There were about fifty of them of which the last ten\u2019s names and deeds were memorized by you last summer. \n\n\n\n\nStill, your self-study didn\u2019t seem to have impressed your tutor all that much. All he did was lean back to his chair while casually stating the following.  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you had learnt this much, these documents and books will not be useful to your royal highness.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEckhart shot up and glared at the man. Before he could open his mouth you raised your hand. This will certainly be a pleasant conversation or at least an interesting one.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one except us will hear the words spoken in this room.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe tutor \u2018s lips curled up in a calculating smile. It carried the same glint your parents always showed during their respective social gatherings. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI do wonder where the power of a ruler lies, how his authority is justified.\u201d He said. \n\n\n\n\nYou glanced at Eckhart who was impatiently waiting for his turn to speak. It couldn\u2019t hurt to let him answer this question for once. It would help him get some of his confidence back. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course it is because of Schneeuwerik\u2019s thread. She had put the first piece in the heart of the first king of this nation and put her trust into his children. The king\u2019s will is the gods\u2019 will.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nA small smile as praise from you was enough for Eckhart to puff out his chest. The tutor nodded.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is indeed what I ought to teach you.\u201d He then looked at Fulke who had all this time been hiding in the far corner of the room. Drops of sweat had already stained his cravat. \u201cI do recall that my lovely assistant had heard of other answers outside the castle\u2019s premises.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke lowered his head and folded his arms as if to cradle himself.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSchneeuwerik does not extend her hand unconditionally. To keep her thread, one has to take care of the realm and the lives she held so dearly. Like what happened with the four gods and the time weaver, this grace could easily be taken away.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\u201cMaster Grunnenberg, is this satisfactory?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tutor didn\u2019t spare him a single look. The whole time he was focused on you. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cTell me, what will your answer be?\u201d\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "\u201cThe ruler is granted his power by the divine right.\u201d", "result": "Was this really a topic one had to discuss? Every noble had learnt this tale for this exact reason. It was part of their curriculum and one of the first stories you had been taught, at least in its simplified form. Even someone who loathed to study like Eckhart knew it by heart. A person was either born to be a ruler and granted Schneeuwerik\u2019s affection or they had to serve under the ruler himself.\n\n\nThat was the way of life.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFulke\u2019s answer appears to be quite unorthodox. His environment must be very different from the castle.\u201d You said.\n\n\n\n\nThe tutor stroke his chin. He didn\u2019t seem very bothered. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy students all like to gather all kinds of information from various sources. Please forgive my student\u2019s impudence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing your words Fulke shrunk back even more. You couldn\u2019t help but pity the boy a little. He must be thinking how he had earned your or his master\u2019s ire. As far as you knew, apprehending him would only touch the threads, but it will not cut it. If you could keep him closer, information will be easier to spin out of him. No dissidents were allowed to exist, but patience was the key to such affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTeacher, could you show Fulke\u2019s handwriting to us?\u201d You asked. \n\n\n\n\nThe tutor pointed at the small stack of bound papers in the upper right corner of your desk. With one glance, you had made your decision final. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is indeed very pleasing to the eye.\u201d You smiled at the tutor and Eckhart. \u201cCould you two leave the room for a moment? There is a message about to be passed to your assistant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou patiently waited for them to obey your command. On his way out Eckhart gave you a puzzled look to which you shrugged. If he guarded your door, then it would be no problem at all in your opinion. You will explain it to him later when his shift was done. \n\nNow all the people who were left was you and Fulke who was now almost trembling under your gaze. It will be better to be as direct as possible with him.  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, I know that you are not the assistant Viscount Grunnenberg had planned to bring. What is your reason for meeting me? I do admit that you have a lot of nerve for someone of your standing.\u201d You asked while you dropped your polite smile. \u201cIs it to get my father\u2019s favor, hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI-I Have. I-\u201c\n\n\n\n\nYou sighed and said. \u201cCome on, spit it out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to serve you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhat was that? You blinked. Did he really say that? You blinked again before you regained your composure. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke averted eyes while color crept to his cheeks. He answered shyly. \u201cTo protect the person important to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSo you had indeed guessed it right. He did pull of this stunt to protect his mother, father or his siblings. Maybe a noble of higher standing had terrorized his family for a while and now he sought your protection. However, this was quite an unconventional approach. Couldn\u2019t he simply ask a duke of a high ranking duchy for help or something instead of you?\n\n\n\n\nWell, you will find out soon enough if you take him under your wing.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to ask you if you would be ever so willing to brush up Eckhart\u2019s way of words, but perhaps I could ask permission for you to be my personal retainer. However, that decision will depend on your other qualities and talents.\u201d You said. \u201cTo go through such lengths for your family is indeed admirable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden every single trace of nervousness or fear melted away from Fulke\u2019s face as if Schneeuwerik had secretly blessed him herself. At last he met your eyes with a full determined look. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cGathering information is my specialty.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThis was getting quite fun. You leant forward. \u201cThen tell me something I do not know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reason for your guard\u2019s lowered mood is because his Schneeuwerik had refused to accept his life thread.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nYou blinked. \u201cSay that again?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the daughter of the duke of Cassisheit.\u201d He said. \n\n\n\n\nYou stood up and marched to the door. Before you opened it, you turned back to Fulke. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf this nonsense what you\u2019re talking about is true, I promise with the time weaver as my guard that you will be my personal retainer.\u201d You then lowered your voice. \u201cIf I find out that you only possess a vivid imagination and the skill of trickery, you know what I will do with your future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke\u2019s face paled slightly. It was fascinating that he could be frightened this easily. He must have been beaten up quite a bit when he was little. Well, you still wanted to keep him close to you no matter what will happen next, but he didn\u2019t have to know that small detail yet.\n\n\n\n\nYou quickly pulled Eckhart aside and whispered in his ear. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIs Fransisca your Schneeuwerik?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nHis cheeks reddened as he tried to find his words. You tilted your head. So Fulke\u2019s information was indeed hogwash. It should be very obvious to you now. Last time you had spoken with Eckhart, he had all too easily expressed his disgust towards the fairer sex. All of a sudden he knitted his brows and closed his eyes so tightly as if he wanted to squeeze the words right out of him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, she is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou blinked. Well, you should write your parents a letter then. Since viscount Grunnenberg had claimed to not be able to teach you anything worthwhile and was awfully late on top of that, perhaps you should also ask for another tutor. \n\n\n ", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "\u201cThe ruler is granted his power by the will of the kingdom.\u201d", "result": "Although you weren\u2019t absolutely sure about Fulke\u2019s theory, it was nevertheless interesting enough for you to want to keep this conversation going and entertain them for the time being. The moment you had expressed you interest, Eckhart looked at you with his brows so raised up that they could almost touch his hairline. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is curious how one would arrive at such an conclusion.\u201d You said. \u201cWho might this person be?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe tutor clapped his hands together. A carefree smile shimmered under his pursed lips.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many who had exchanged these thoughts. The divine right was not the sole factor how one could determine a suitable ruler. Sometimes a person who is in possession of the thread may not be able to wield it effectively.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou were now absolutely certain that the main promoter of these ideas was the viscount and that Fulke was roped into his schemes. If they were talking to any other person, this conversation may have not ended this well. They were really playing with fire here. Well, now that they had displayed such a huge amount of courage to say this to a member of the royal family, you had the desire to know more.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo there must be other qualities a king must have? Would it be fair to assume that he ought to mirror the time weaver?\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe humans will never be able to find a perfect candidate with all the knowledge in the world while still keeping his compassion. However, with the strength of many, the least worse decisions are easier to find.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you mean that the rulers should be everyone, from the lowest peasant to the highest ranking dukes?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery opinion is valuable according to this viewpoint.\u201d He said while his eyes kept twinkling. \u201cI can return another time to elaborate more on it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou shook your head. This wasn\u2019t something you could report back to your parents. Your eyes then shifted to Fulke. As Fulke continued to cower in fear, you slowly curled your lips. That might be a good solution. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cTeacher, could you show Fulke\u2019s handwriting to us?\u201d You asked. \n\n\n\n\nThe tutor pointed at the small stack of bound papers in the upper right corner of your desk. With one glance, you had made your decision final. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is indeed very pleasing to the eye.\u201d You broadened your smile while still keeping your eyes on Fulke. \u201cWould you be ever so willing to brush up Eckhart\u2019s way of words?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEckhart gave you a panicked look in return. You raised your brows and subsequently gave a slight nod to permit him to join the conversation. The moment you did so, his bellowing voice was back. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is younger than me and of lower rank too. Why does he have to teach me? I can do things fine myself your royal highness.\u201d\n\nSweet sweet Eckart, in one single line, he had already made one false statement out of three and he wouldn\u2019t even know which one. At least he got his fire back, even if it was probably only for this short moment. \n\n\n\n\nNow he had even caused the whimpering Fulke to press his back against the wall. The first fleeting thought that had crossed you mind was that Fulke was probably bullied by other children in the past. That assumption also fitted in quite well with your theory that he was the second or third son of a low ranking baron.\n\n\n\n\nIt was your duty as the person with the highest authority to put a stop to this blossoming animosity between these two. It would be better for your own sanity if they got along immediately, but the  strings of the earthly realm were oddly placed as always. \n\n\u201cI-I believe that a more beautiful handwriting will win the approval of Schneeuwerik.\u201d Fulke said. \n\n\n\n\nSweet sweet Fulke, why did you have to make life so difficult? Eckhart will only be more angered with this nonsense you spit out so brazenly. You already could feel a headache settling in as you rubbed your temples. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Eckhart sputtered. His cheeks were flushed out of anger.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis revelation had graced me when Lentetulp had given her first blessing and kiss to the earthly realm. The threads had been spun with another time weaver\u2019s apprentice but I heard that the threads of life had not been fully woven yet.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nYou sighed. Fulke really had dug himself a grave here. To think that he would question whether Eckhart was fit to be your retainer while at the same time implying that you had been looking for another apprentice. It was high time that you should intervene, before Eckhart might get some wrong ideas about your intentions. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, Eckhart\u2019s eyes lit up. He curled his fingers into fists.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTell me more and then our fates are woven together.\u201d Eckhart said. \n\n\n\n\nYou leaned back. Was it not up to you to make have the last say on this? Well, Eckhart seemed to be out of his recent slump, so you will let him have his fun for now. You hoped that he would not beat him up too hard. You didn\u2019t want your parents to yell at you again for not stopping Eckhart\u2019s rampages.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour sword dance of last spring is abysmal to look at and doesn\u2019t even resemble the grace of the time weaver and your roughness in the way you carry yourself will frighten people who are of equal footing to you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWas Fulke really asking to be beaten up? You threw your hands off this mess and was already thinking about how you should deal with the aftermath. \n\n\n\n\nTo your surprise, both Fulke and Eckhart shook hands in a sense of true camaraderie. It was truly a sight to behold.  Although Eckhart was perhaps squeezing his hand a little too tightly based on Fulke\u2019s pained expression, there were no blows exchanged between them. When you looked at the tutor, he was as struck by this unusual chain of events as you. \n\n\n\n\nAfter Eckhart finally let go of the poor boy, Fulke slumped against the wall while clutching tightly to his hand. You stepped out of your desk to check whether it was something worth reporting. With one firm look, Eckhart stepped back so that you could take a proper look. \n\n\n\n\nYou took Fulke\u2019s hand to examine it. Strangely enough, he let you do so without much protest. It looked a little reddened, but it seemed like he was still able to move his fingers. Then your eyes caught the inside of his sleeve. A small piece of fabric was poking out of it. When you lightly tugged at it, you saw the embroidery that was all too familiar to you. \n\n\n\n\nHow did he come to possess your handkerchief? Why did he even have it in the first place? You knew that Fulke probably had underlying reasons to come here just like the tutor, but to think that this was the reason. You must have done something in the past to earn his fixation on you. You closed your eyes and rubbed your temples with your free hand.\n\n\n\n\nNo one will have to know, not even Fulke. \n\n\n\n\nYou should leave this out of your report.\n\n\n\n\nSince viscount Grunnenberg had claimed to not be able to teach you anything worthwhile, perhaps you should ask for another tutor. Ah, that would make for a splendid report.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Your first time witnessing death", "result": "The day when Herafst sung her howling songs to her most treasured sisters Zummerin and Lentetulp, was the day you had first witnessed a death. Of course you heard about the increasing amount of executions for treason, but these people weren\u2019t individuals you knew or really cared about. At some point you knew that you had to succeed your parents and find a proper wife to produce the next heir. \n\n\n\n\nIt was during this dinner, a rarity nowadays, that your parents were about to discuss who your betrothed will be. You had returned from the royal academy just one month ago. Marrying and looking for a girl had not even crossed your mind even though this too was your duty. It honestly felt strange to be twenty now and to be of marriageable age. You still were the same person you were the year before. Nothing should have changed.\n\n\n\n\nThe long table with your mother and father sitting at each end of it, was now completely devoid of guests. You were sitting in the middle while you tried to not wander your eyes too far away from them. Your free hand was fumbling with your cape. It felt kind of odd to walk around without your brooch. A few days ago it had somehow vanished along with the feeling that this dinner conversation would ever go well. \n\n\n\n\nBehind you stood Eckhart whose mind was in a place beyond your scope of comprehension. He was still gazing at his silver necklace with her thread encased in the glowing gemstone as if it was Fransisca herself. You didn\u2019t know how he had managed to get the daughter of the duke of Cassisheit to accept his thread, even though you all were aware of the fact that she favored the arts more than swordplay. You sighed in your head. It was really a miracle come true, for him at least. You really didn't mind if he remained for the rest of his life a bachelor. Perhaps you would have preferred it, but that wouldn't do for Eckhart. It was too bad that Fulke who was visiting his family, couldn\u2019t reign him in this very moment.\n\nYou stirred your sweetened porridge while your father and mother took their first bite. They were probably waiting for you to make the first suggestions of possible candidates, but you didn\u2019t care that much. You could trust your parents\u2019 judgement to select someone who would bring the most stability to the kingdom. It would likely be a daughter from a higher ranked duchy who had close ties to your mother\u2019s faction. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIs this all you wanted to report?\u201d Your mother said. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were also rumors about Essenschaft introducing clothes with threads made of an unique kind of spinning frame though our apprentice scholars were not able to gather more information in the academy\u2019s dormitory. We have to especially keep close eyes to Lossenhilt as there was movement reported between their duchy\u2019s border gate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA spinning frame?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeed mother, with this device one could spin twice, no perhaps four times as fast as a skilled craftsman,\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou knitted your brows. The kingdom still had an upper hand in textiles and pattern weaving, but if knowledge of this spinning frame spread, the threads of the time weaver will be rewoven again. You would have liked to warn your parents beforehand, but letters, even from the future king could be intercepted. \n\n\n\n\nYour father carefully nodded and folded his hands. \u201cLet us put this matter aside till we have a better understanding how we should proceed next. Have your eyes seen the entangled thread yet?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou remained silent. If you were to guess what will follow after this twitch in his eyes, you hoped that it would only be a light scolding. Just as you were about to find some hope, he rubbed his temples.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t the wet nurse and your other retainers instruct you about the duty of the next bearer of the life thread?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAnd that was ensuring the next generation of candidates to the throne, you fool. How could I ever have raised such a sloth? Your mind already filled in the words left unspoken. It was better to have finished this matter in this meeting before Eckhart in his fretted state of panic would induce another headache to you. Let\u2019s see, it had to be someone of a high ranking duchy who had not close ties to Essenschaft or had other questionable loyalties. You glanced back at Eckhart when a certain individual sprung in mind.\n\n\u201cThen shall we pick the duke of Cassisheit\u2019s second daughter?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEckhart\u2019s face paled for an odd reason. You tilted your head. It would seem like a well-thought out pick and with her being recently born, your peace and quiet in your quarters will be retained for much longer. \n\n\n\n\nYou then looked at your father and mother for approval, but all of a sudden they both collapsed. From that moment on the time weaver had ceased his work. Ceramic plates and silver cups clattered on the floor. You heard faint footsteps and voices coming from outside. Eckhart gripped your arm so tightly that it would certainly bruise, but you hadn\u2019t felt anything as all your senses were numbed. The plate in front of you stretched and bent under your eyes like a whirling cloud. \n\n\n\n\nYour parents were fine moments before. They both carried a rosy complexion, had no previous known ailments. Their threads were destined to be long. How could facts and reality be this warped? Then a sharp sting on your cheek brought your thoughts into a standstill.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour majesty, please give me your order.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEckhart tightened his grip on you while unsheathing his sword. You could tell that he was desperately trying to hold back any curse words or any other foul language by the way he had clenched his teeth. You both turned your heads as you saw the dining room\u2019s door flying open. A flood of guards flooded in the room with the commander and a panting Fulke in the lead.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a massive attack going on, the duke of Cassisheit. Don\u2019t touch the porri-\u201c\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as their eyes locked on the unmoving bodies of your parents, they lowered their heads in shame. When they saw you living and breathing, they all let out a small sigh of relief. However, Eckhart eyes widened the moment the Cassisheit family was mentioned. \n\n\n\n\nSwallowing down the rising bile in your throat, you tore your gaze away from your parents and raised your hand to stop Eckhart\u2019s upcoming rampage.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease let an apt physician examine his majesty\u2019s and her majesty\u2019s pulse.\u201d You shifted your eyes to the commander. \u201cUncle, please explain your sudden arrival and why Fulke has accompanied you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour majest-\u201c \n\n\n\n\nYour heart twisted and something seemed to have clammed up in your chest.  The commander paused. His eyes flitted towards the place where they had collapsed. His arms which were pressed stiffly against his sides, shook while he gave his report.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour royal highness, There was a peasant uprising in the duchy of Cassisheit. They would have held them off, but someone seemed to have supplied them with firearms. They, these wretched people, stormed the mansion. The whole family had come to meet the time weaver.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n Fulke filled in the rest. \u201cThese two incidents seemed to be orchestrated by the same group. From the gathered intel, viscount Grunnenberg and the other nobles whose name we currently do not possess, had planned to assassinate the royal family. The cook and the taste testers had already admitted their guilt.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe lowered his head before pushing the last sentence out. \u201cMy father seemed to also be implicated in this plot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEverything had finally sunk in as a heavy weight pooled in your stomach. The future that was once so certain had crumbled within one meal. In your last bout of denial, you clung to the small hope that your parents will wake up and take control with as much grace as they had always done. However, the physician that had just arrived tightly shook his head. Without any words exchanged between you two, you had been forced to accept that your parents had truly left the earthly realm. \n\n\n\n\nEckhart too barely held himself together as he tightly clutched to his necklace. For the first time you saw the stubborn yet strong hearted Eckhart shed his tears.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cook and the taste testers, we have to bring them here, your majesty\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease do.\u201d You said. \n\n\n\n\nSoon enough the traitors had been brought in. No, that might be too much of an euphemism. They were dragged into the dining room as if they were pigs about to be slaughtered. There were two men, one of which was the head cook and two women who had both served as taste testers for the royal family. They cowered and knelt as you stepped forward to examine them closer. \n\n\n\n\nYou knew that all the royal family\u2019s closest attendants were nobles that had pledged their oath. You tilted your head. You wondered why they had decided to betray you. Was it perhaps due to financial struggles or simply to gather more influence after the status quo had shifted?\n\n\n\n\n\u201cW-we were forced into this, your majesty.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease grant us your mercy, I have no son, my daughter\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cForgive us, this was all the fault of the baron.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the viscount. He had threatened to maim my family if I didn\u2019t obey.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBefore you could respond to their pleas, one of the attendant\u2019s face had met Eckhart\u2019s boot. A cold fury flashed in his eyes while he dug his heels into the man\u2019s ribs. He briskly turned his head to meet your eyes. His cold voice seemly devoid of any emotion besides contempt and his uncharacteristically soft spoken words sent shivers to even the most hardened guards in the room.\n\n\u201cYour majesty, oath breakers do not deserve your mercy. It would be recommended to commence their execution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou closed your eyes. All the roaring emotions raging inside of you were shoved into a tiny box and closed with a lid. You had to act as the ruler now. The life thread was now yours to protect. The young and carefree prince Henrik, who was determined to choose the path with the least headaches, had no right to exist anymore. Your eyes opened as you had accepted your new mantle.\n\nFulke had all this time been looking at you with teary eyes. He did say that his father had also played a role in your parents' and the Cassisheit family\u2019s death. If you were to give a harsh punishment to these attendants, one couldn\u2019t show sudden mercy to a lowly baron, especially when the oath breakers' families were all of a higher standing. \n\n\n\n\nThe commander had all this time been silent. With one glance you could tell that he was waiting for your answer.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Spare their lives.", "result": "\u201cHave them all be relieved from their duty and place them under house arrest. Assign your most trusted guards to keep watch over them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou didn\u2019t want any blood to spill. There was also the fact that you wanted to pry every single piece of information out of them while preventing them communicating to other nobles involved in this plot. Dead men sadly couldn\u2019t speak. A lot more people were behind this scheme. Based on the enormous web of contacts that had been spun,  the ring leader must be someone with quite a huge amount of influence and authority, someone with as much influence as a duke. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d The commander knelt and left the room with all the guards gathered here. The oath breakers followed them, now bound with a rope. The last ones to leave were the bodies of your parents, now wrapped in a table cloth to preserve their modesty. The only occupants of the room were you, Fulke and Eckhart. \n\n\n\n\nAs soon as you tried to think of ways to calm Eckhart down, he unleashed his full fury on you. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow could you, how could you fucking do this? They killed your damn parents and now you're treating them like your guests? Have you gone mad?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSomething in you just broke. There was no one you had to keep up appearances to. You two could talk like you used to do before any roles were enforced on you, back when he was just your older brother. It wasn't proper to show such a weakness to others, especially to people that relied on you. However, you couldn't keep your words from wavering.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEckhart, please.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe closed his eyes and breathed in deeply. \u201cI, I need to be alone, think a little.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn other circumstances, it would be tremendously amusing that Eckhart voluntarily offered to use his head for once. It would be such a feat that even the timid Fulke would pester him for days about it. Now, it only made the feeling even more bitter when the door slammed shut.\n\n\n\n\nYou sighed and slumped back into your chair. Despite the fact you hadn't done that much besides sitting around and talking, every part of your body ached. Your eyelids felt heavy. Was this even the right decision?. You cocked your head to Fulke. The whole time he had kept quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow much of a blunder have I made during my first day as king?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEckhart is a person who needs to get things out of his mind by means of physical activity. He will set his priorities straight soon enough.\u201d Fulke said. \n\n\n\n\nWhy did he always have such a way of words? Did he pity you enough that he tried to spare your feelings and dodge your question? Everything was in shambles in your head. You let out a dry laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I should have executed your father.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat would be a choice a normal king would make, a laudable choice even considering these particular chain of events.\u201d He said. A small smile traced his lips.  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy former master had summoned my father a few days ago. It appeared that my father had been quite stricken by the contents of his letter and I admit that I had taken a peak at its contents too without his expressed permission. After that I had decided to motivate some of our family\u2019s attendants a little so that they paid closer attention to his words. The royal family was mentioned and a certain kind of porridge. There was sadly not enough time for me to intervene.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt was quite callous of Fulke to be so calculating towards his former master, but you were glad that Fulke\u2019s loyalty to you was higher than him. One wouldn\u2019t want to earn Fulke\u2019s wrath. Eckhart had once claimed that you were the one who had corrupted the poor boy, but in your opinion he was already full of poison. Without you ever instructing him, he had not only used your wetnurse who was also Eckhart's mother to keep him in line whenever he tried to escape their study sessions and later on he had somehow managed Eckhart's tutor in swordsmanship to bar Eckhart from training if he wasn't progressing as fast as he should. \n\n\n\n\nFulke slid his wrist into the inside of his coat. Low and behold, your lost golden brooch now was clasped in his hand. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I had to decide my next course of action as quickly as possible. I went straight to the commander's room using your brooch as proof that this was an urgent matter that ought to not be ignored. I convinced him to send some guards to fetch the cook and the taste testers as there was a high likelihood that they would have been bribed by my father. If they were caught before the dishes were served, then this crises was averted. To my dismay, this incompetent waste of space had managed to succeed for once. Ah, it would be more than satisfactory to see their eyes of despair as their whole future is snipped away.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHis eyes sparkled with a fevered shine as if he was a blushing maiden. He intertwined his fingers together while he dreamily laid his cheeks on the back of his hands. \n\n\n\n\nThis was actually the first time you saw him like this. When he was with you, he was a lot more quiet, timid, a little panicky and twitchy like a small rodent. In the beginning and even until now you thought that Eckhart had exaggerated the stories about Fulke. Perhaps they were true after all. You didn't really want to ask why he had stolen your brooch in the first place as he had only known of this summoning after he had taken his leave. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cShouldn't you be angry that I hadn't done so?\u201d You said.\n\n\n\n\nFulke leant back to the dinner table. He lightly hummed a soft tune. The corners of his eyes wrinkled a little.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou saved my father, how could I possibly be upset? He may have not have been spun from the thickest thread, but I know he considers me to be his Lentetulp. Without him, a child born out of wedlock would be quietly disposed of as the other members of my family would always gladly like to remind me. My father\u2026 he is the only one\u2026.. I'm unable to discard him and him me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEven after you publicly opposed him?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe frowned and said. \u201cOne says that although the three siblings carried a grudge towards Schneeuwerik due to her being the reason for the eternal continuation of their punishment, they still called her their little sister.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe shuffled closer to you and carefully placed the brooch on your palms. His warm fingertips grazed your skin.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's no one in the room. Everything that happens within these walls stays with you and me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSeeing the gemstone, the only thing your parents had personally gifted to you, lying in the palm of your hand, made your stomach twist in knots. You heard his soft yelp when you rested your head against his shoulder. At first you felt nothing, but as you felt his warmth the lid of bottled feelings sprung open when you realized what you had truly lost. This future where your mother lavished praises to you while your father nodded in approval, no, where they embraced you telling that everything will be fine, was a future that wasn't likely to happen if at all. However, the fact that the possibility of this ever happening was ripped away from you so suddenly, made you want to grieve for the times that had never existed.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWill Eckhart leave me?\u201d You whispered.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know that he can't.\u201d Fulke then paused. \u201cI think you should also think a little more yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't understand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I know that you will come up with something good, seeing that you are the furthest thing from conventional as one can be, but that is precisely the reason why many people want to serve you and are concerned about your future and wellbeing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe following day, Eckhart came back just as Fulke had said. He had acted like nothing had happened, as if nothing had changed between the two of you. Even when you two were in the study where the thick wall shielded the words exchanged in the room, the stony face of professionalism hadn't softened in the slightest amount.\n\n\n\n\nYou gave him a tight smile before unclasping your brooch from your cape. Eckhart's eyes widened as you pinned it under his one. Ah, good to see that he was already becoming more like Eckhart.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis, please keep it safe as my milk sibling. The stone will accompany you at night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI can't accept this, I'm not worthy of such trust after I had questioned your judgement and done\u2026.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou still decided to come back to keep me from wreaking havoc in the palace or to remind me of my duties, am I not correct to take this as a fact?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nEckhart's eyes hardened. With heavily furrowed brows he knelt in front of you.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat use does an older brother have if he cannot protect his little brother?\u201d he said while slowly curving up his lips.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Execute them all.", "result": "\u201cHave them all be executed as swiftly as possible with the highest possible dishonor.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nThis was what one had to do when someone committed treason. Your ancestors, even the first king of the nation who was wildly beloved by his subjects, had to quell an insurrection or two during his time. If you were to punish them lightly, your future authority may be questioned in the future. A possible weakness of you will be revealed, something that would put you at a great disadvantage.  The commander had seemed to come to the same conclusion as you as he curtly nodded.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAfter you had spoken your verdict the oath breakers lost their last bit of restraint. Some of them were crying, the cook was outright screaming when the guards forced them to line up. With the sharp edge of their swords they shaved off all of their hair. Then they wrung their brooches and capes out of them. The family stones were smashed into tiny fragments while their capes were torn to shreds. \n\n\n\n\nOnce they were done, they kicked the head cook forward so that his face remained planted on the floor. He only stopped crying when a sword was thrust inside his chest. The other remaining oath breakers watched in horror as blood frothed out of the man's mouth before he collapsed soon afterwards. You tilted your head. There were now three people left. Their cries grew weaker and weaker as the executions were carried out till the last one, a woman who looked like she had just completed her coming of age ceremony, was released from her duty.\n\n\n\n\nYou scrunched up your nose. The stale air of rust bristled against the back of your neck. It wasn't your first execution. One year before you became an adult you had witnessed your parents ordering the same thing. In their case it was a captain who had apparently sneaked in vital information about the king and queen to Essenschaft. At that time, it hadn't bothered you this much except for the foul odor that hung in the courtyard corridors for days. \n\n\n\n\nYou looked at the bodies that had now been thrown in a single pile. Blood pooled underneath them. Their dark red color stained the wooden planks. You swallowed down the bile that had been building up inside you. Now that you were the one issuing this order, you finally knew that this was quite different.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the most painful part of the execution was over, the process was considered to be incomplete without the grand parade. Until that was done, it was customary that their bodies will not be buried yet. Their disgraced corpses will be paraded down the streets to show others the outcome when one's loyalty to the king wavered. \n\n\n\n\nOnce they made sure that no one was breathing, the guards hauled up their bodies and left to prepare for tomorrow's festivities. The commander had ordered the remaining soldiers to wrap your parents' bodies with the table cloth and carefully carried them out of the dining room. Before he closed the door, he gave one sympathetic glance to Fulke and you.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the soft click of the knob became a sound from the distant past, the only people that were left in the dining room were you, Eckhart and Fulke.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have to attend to some family matters.\u201d He said after he closed his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLook, Fulke it had to be do-.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, your majesty, I respect your judgement and your reasoning. It was honestly a commendable action you took, but I need to notify the other members of my house and discuss how to proceed.\u201d He sighed before continuing. \u201cI will come back next day, forgive me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou knew that this was bound to happen, but the way he expressed his words so coldly made your chest sting a little. Eckhart rushed forward and grabbed Fulke by his collar.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you fucking swear to your oath? While you are running away to hide in your little family shack, his majesty will be dealing with the full fallout tomorrow. Your life, my life, they don't matter as long as Henrik remains safe.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd Fransisca's life, can you throw her away if this were to benefit his majesty?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nA vein in his forehead popped. Eckhart glared at him as he said the following in a low voice. \u201cDon't speak about her like that.\u201d\n\nFulke gave him a small smile.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSee, your answer is all too clear.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nHe then turned away from Eckhart who seemed to have been frozen into place and rested his eyes on you. Swiftly closing the distance between you two, he slipped your long lost brooch in your coat pocket.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'll take my leave.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\n\n The dining room remained oddly quiet for a while after Fulke had left. Not wanting to leave the room just yet, you slumped back to your chair. The untouched porridge in front of you had stiffened. You were the one who broke the silence.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIs what Fulke had said true?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy life is yours to command.\u201d He said with a stony face. \n\n\n\n\nYour eyes wandered off to his hands which were quivering under Herafst' autumn air. Eckhart was never a born master of deception. If there was a secret to hide or someone who tried to pry information out of his mouth, he would simply not speak. The way how he carried his emotions under his sleeve, made him not really suitable to gather intel. However, it did make you want to lower your guard to him just a little more as his rather crude way of showing his emotions put you more at ease than any carefully thought out noblelike response. \n\n\n\n\nYour hands tightly wound themselves around your brooch that had at last returned to your side. Slowly you shuffled closer to him. You saw his eyes widen ever so slightly when you pinned it underneath his own.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was lost.\u201d He sputtered out.\n\n\n\n\nYou shrugged while tilting your head. Fulke had indeed been very careful about it or Eckhart was really that obvious about everything that didn't concern his guard duties. You blinked. It was probably both. The question how Fulke had even come to possess your brooch briefly flitted in your mind before you focused your attention back to Eckhart. There were more important things to deal with.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEckhart, please keep it safe as my milk sibling.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe person in question looked at the brooch and then at you. His mouth hung wide open as you could visibly see him parse out what had just happened.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI had just told you that-\"\n\n\n\n\nBefore he could spout more nonsense, you held up your hand.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow many times did I have to see you talk about how beautiful Fransisca is, how nice she smells, how her voice rang like the temple bells and so on. Any dim witted individual would have known by now that she is your Schneeuwerik.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nTo emphasize you point, you pressed your index finger on his forehead. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I had wanted this liability to be gone, I would have done so the moment you had announced your engagement, no?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEckhart swallowed. You tilted your head. Hadn't this thought ever crossed his mind before? You thought a little harder. The answer was that he probably hadn't done so, because that action would require him to think for an extra moment. Sweet, sweet Eckhart, causing headaches for you even during these grave times.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's no one here. In this room we are only brothers, Henrik and his insufferable brother Eckhart.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou gasped as Eckhart pulled you into a bear hug. His wet cheeks were pressed on the crook of your neck. Humming a gentle tune, you patted him on his back like a parent consoling their child. Feeling his warm arms reminded you of memories that had never existed. Times where you and your mother walked hand in hand or where your father ruffled your hair while he lathered his praise to you. Although these dreams seemed so far out of reach before this day where the time weaver ceased to spin his threads, you couldn't help but mourn that the possibility of this mirage ever becoming reality had been crushed before your eyes. \n\n\nAt some point along the way you didn't know whose tears had dampened your cravat.\n\n\n\n\nThe following day, Fulke had come back as promised. When asked if everything was sorted out, he gave you a thin polite smile. Only months later you had heard that the baron\u2019s family was found floating in the river.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Your first time seeing an invention", "result": "Winter, a time where Schneeuwerik\u2019s tears formed the raging blizzards and her misery covered the planes in thick layers of snow, was usually the time where everyone huddled together to avert the goddess\u2019 haunted wails.  One could only pray that Lentetulp will soon arrive with her other siblings as the time weaver unwound his threads yet again. \n\n\n\n\nYou rubbed your hands together after you had signed one document after the other. Most of them dealt with trade matters, military matters and infrastructure. Putting your seal on these pieces of paper, was only a formality. All of the actual discussions on future policies happened behind close doors as long as the people involved were able to travel to the palace. It was more efficient this way, letting people speak out to their heart's contents and hear them argue their points. The written word was a miraculous invention, but it lacked the nuance needed to parse out a person's true intentions.\n\n\n\n\nIt was still odd to be working in your late father's study. You placed the pen's nib into the ink vial, making sure to not spill a single drop on his dark wooden desk. Although it had already been two years after your parents' untimely arrival at the realm of the gods, your chest still ached whenever you took your seat in your father's chair or used his cup. \n\n\n\n\nEvery object seemed to be in the wrong place, color and shape in this room. The desk should have been a light yellowish color that stood so low that your knees were constantly bumping on the wood. The wooden walls should have been left bare and not fully covered in a wealth of tapestry. While your old study could just barely fit in four people comfortably within its borders, your father's office was twice as big with twice as many chairs. Whereas the study lacked any isolation or heat source, making it cruelly cold in the winter and unbearably hot in the summer, this office felt almost too comfortable to you with its grand hearth placed on your left.\n\n\n\n\nThe utter unwelcomeness made you feel as if the room was straight up telling you that you were a foreigner to this land. \n\nYou looked up to see your guard Eckhart sitting in his usual spot near the window, furrowing his brows over his own pile of letters. Although he had refused the offer to rule over Cassisheit as the new duke, he still kept close ties to the region, exchanging letters with the current ruler every month or so. Although you and your advisor Fulke were happy that Eckhart was finally doing paperwork without the need for either of you to threaten or bribe him, you both had to admit that this extra thinking work had by now fried his mind. It was probably very disheartening for him to see such a high ranking duchy fall to grace within only one year despite one's highest efforts to keep things afloat.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPermit, building, road, army.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nHe mumbled. Sweat dripped from his forehead as his clammy hands jotted down things that were supposed to resemble words which became even more indecipherable as time went by. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHis majesty, fried fish, sleep, chicken, spring, oh dear gods.\u201d He mumbled.\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't only Eckhart who was working on the brink of collapse, Fulke had not been looking well either. His natural spindly body was now almost skeletal. In certain parts of his joints you can see his skin stretching over his bones. His eyes scoured over the newspaper headlines to look for anything out of the ordinary while his trembling hand barely kept the liquid inside his cup.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs expected, the multi-spindle spinning frame has now spread all over Essenschaft. The new stream of threads will lower the costs of textiles made there. I wonder if our workshops can keep it up.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nHe furrowed his brows as he sipped on his tea. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cLet's see what I have to do next. Yes, indeed, check Fulke's handwriting, fish out any grammatical errors and make him rewrite the letter again. I shall make plans how to motivate him next time if he decides to lengthen his break.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPoor Fulke was following Eckhart's lead. You cradled your head as you saw your two most trusted retainers slowly fall into their own kind of madness. As for you, you had to keep your eyes close to the duke of Lossenhilt. Last year you had done some digging through old documents and mailing lists and found out that this duchy where the captain whom your parents had executed years ago hailed from, had exchanged a suspiciously large amount of letters to Essenschaft. This was all still sheer speculation, but it seemed that the man behind Grunnenberg's orchestrated attacks on the duchy of Cassisheit and the royal family was none other than Lossenhilt. You placed your hands on your hand on your cheek. \n\n\n\n\nSadly enough viscount Grunnenberg was found dead in his room a few days after that certain incident. Fulke said that the reports claimed that it was due to alcohol poisoning, but in the short time you had spoke to him, you felt that Grunnenberg didn't seem like a man to overly indulge himself in bottles of wine. Fulke had also agreed with you. \n\n\n\n\nDespite all those threads coming together like this, there was no good pin to hold them all together. Due to Lossenhilt's size and huge influence, you couldn't just quietly quicken the duke\u2019s year of retirement. There had to be at least a smidge of evidence, something potent enough to tarnish the duke's reputation and weaken his supporters.\n\n\n\n\nFulke said that the new generation of future nobles had opted to spend their time in these so-called parlor rooms instead of gardens and courtyards where tea parties were held. Most of them offered enriching substances for the mind and a wealth of Zummerin's water imported from the southern duchies. A lot of writers, artists and philosophers gathered there as well, making this a hotspot for the latest trends and ideas. You narrowed your eyes as you sunk into deeper thoughts. If you planted a tiny rumor about the duke in these smoke-filled drug dens and pass on some high quality wine bottles, then it would surely spread like wildfire.\n\n\n\n\nJust as you were about to relay this idea to Fulke to test whether it held up under his scrutiny, your eyes snapped back to the door. Someone was knocking. It took only a few moments for your mind to catch up with the present day. Fulke frequently gathered intel in these parlor rooms and had a few weeks ago told you that he had planned to invite a regular to the palace. Uncharacteristically of him, he had kept the details vague and refused to elaborate on them further when questioned.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEckhart, please open the door to greet our guest.\u201d You said.\n\n\n\n\nHe only reacted the second time you repeated your request. After some papers that taken flight during Eckhart's mind's awakening were gathered again in a neat pile, Eckhart swiftly shifted into his stony face of cold professionalism and opened the door. \n\n\n\n\nYou blinked again to make sure that you were indeed seeing what you saw. A young woman had indeed entered the room. Seeing that she lacked a cape and family brooch, you concluded that she must be of commoner origins despite her tidy appearance. She kept her bag made out of straw close to her chest, treating its contents as if it was a newborn infant. With anxious eyes similar to a small rodent she looked at Fulke for help. To the woman's relief, Fulke answered her silent plea with a polite smile.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the Merle I was referring to. A former smith\u2019s assistant, she had worked together with a carpenter to produce quite a fascinating invention. One prototype had already been built. Lately she was frequenting the parlor rooms to gather more funding.\u201d\n\n\nHe said while gesturing at her. \u201cPlease let us see your work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe woman hurriedly nodded and fished out the papers from her bag. With quick, but small steps she handed them over to you. Most of them were drawings with some faint charcoal notes scribbled in the corners. Although the notes were faded so much that you weren't able to read them anymore, you knew simply by looking at the pictures that this was quite something. There was a giant wheel attached to it and a set of metal pistons that were supposed to be moving inside a cylinder.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMay I ask what this device can do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI-It's a machine that runs with steam, your majesty. You burn charcoal inside the furnace and boil water in it. This smoke will rise up and cause this wheel to spin. If you attach all kinds of stuff to it with some screws and bolts, you can make things move without you even lifting a finger. You can use it in any season unlike a water wheel or a wind mill.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAt first she had sounded unsure, but as she continued to talk you could see her eyes sparkling in the same way the professors of the royal academy talked about their field of study. Any formalities she once carefully kept up out of fear were now thrown out of the window. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m currently seeking for patrons and then I was asking Fulke about it. It turns out that you too are pretty interested in my darling. Will you become my patron?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou quickly shot a glare at Fulke who straight up pretended that you didn't exist. This was so frustrating. You could already feel that this was going to be massive headache at the end no matter what you chose to do. \n\n\n\n\nNo one seemed to want to make the decision for you as the last person that could possibly give you a way escape this mess, the person who goes by the name of Eckhart, had by now returned to his paperwork. You squeezed your eyes shut and rubbed your temples to banish his mumblings out of your head.\n\n\n\n\nIt was time to make your decision now.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Refuse to be her patron", "result": "With the kingdom still yet to be fully stabilized, you felt that it was unwise to bring in even more trouble. If this machine could truly do everything she had imagined, wouldn't this cause the collapse of nearly every textile workshop and other industries you hadn't even thought of. No, it was too dangerous to invest in this device. Perhaps in the far future you will consider to look at this a second time, but now the only thing you could do was gently refuse her.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm saddened to see that the ends of our threads were sadly not woven together by the time weaver.\u201d You calmly said while donning a pleasant smile. \n\n\n\n\nMerle furrowed her brows and rubbed her chin. She didn't seem to want to leave yet. Was there something else she had to say? Fulke sighed, walked over to her and whispered something in her ear. Her eyes widened for a brief moment before it settled on a exasperated sigh and tired smile. With her back slumped she gathered her drawings and left the study without even saying brief words of farewell.\n\n\n\n\nAn awkward tension hung over the room. There was a lot Fulke had to explain to you and Fulke knew this as well. You two glared daggers at each other, daring the other to give up first. The silence was only interspersed with Eckhart's groans and the sound of pens scratching on sheets of paper. It was ultimately Eckhart that forced you two into a truce. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI give up, it's too hard. Fulke can you look at it for a brief mo-\" \n\n\n\n\nHis mouth hung open as he looked at you and then at Fulke. His dumbfounded expression quickly shifted into a mischievous smirk. He puffed out his chest.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, now, is this a little spat I see? Fulke, Henrik, just spit it out, tell each other your true feelings and all. It cannot be this hard.\u201d\n\nYou reluctantly looked at Fulke. The moment you met his eyes, he promptly looked away. You then cocked your head in Fulke's direction while focusing your attention back to Eckhart. See, this can indeed be this hard. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cCome on, my head really hurts. Why was that commoner girl here in the first place?\u201d He said. \n\n\n\n\nHad he really missed the entire conversation? The mind was truly a marvelous thing. You quickly informed him of everything you knew about her and the significance of Fulke not communicating many things properly to you. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou see, these trade agreements cannot be signed with one single hand wave and Fulke knows it too. If we were to suddenly announce it, we would face a lot of resistance from the workshops and perhaps some duchies that have an economy with a heavy focus on weaving. We have to lay all the necessary groundwork before we can proceed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke covered his face with his hand. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wasn't sure if you would outright refuse to meet her considering her commoner background. Then there is the fact that we need to quickly secure her before other nobles will steal her away. As far as I know, she is the only one that knows the entire inner workings of the machine. We need to set up her contract as fast as possible with as few people listening in. The best time was during winter, this day actually.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStill, you knew that this is not the right time to introduce revolutionary inventions, especially without properly consulting me first.\u201d You said.\n\n\n\n\nA brief flash of cold fury flashed in his eyes. He coolly walked to your desk and leant forward. The slight tilt of his head looked almost innocent except for the broad smile that slathered every word of his in chilly poison.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe information dear Merle possessed cannot fall in hands of Essenschaft. It was either to bring her under our wings or to resort to more conventional measures.\u201d His fingers lightly tapped on the desk. \u201cI had hoped for the former as I was quite fond of her and her family. If my memories didn't betray me, the carpenter was her fianc\u00e9, no?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou accepted his challenge as you met his unblinking eyes. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would be easy for such a resourceful person like you to take care of this matter?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI will not be swayed by mere flattery.\u201d He said. \u201cYou have dug this hole yourself. I will not bloody my hand due to your incompetence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSeeing that this called for reinforcements you flashed a smile at Eckhart who had by now had willingly retired himself from the battlefield. He surely wouldn't mind if you forcibly dragged him back.  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cSay Eckhart, do you mind to guide Fulke gently so that he can see the errors of his ways?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEckhart remained silent. You broadened your smile.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'll do your paperwork in exchange.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nImmediately a new flash of determination replaced the dim look in his eyes. He unclasped the brooch you had given him and dangled it in front of Fulke who longingly stared at the glimmering jewel. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can keep this for an entire day if you help Henrik with his work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke spoke without any hesitation. \u201cIt's a deal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe following month Fulke quietly reported that Merle and her fianc\u00e9 sadly had taken their leave to the realm of the gods. In a tiny section at the far back of the newspaper was reported that a couple had fallen from the bridge and tragically drowned in the river after they went out drinking to celebrate their upcoming wedding.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Offer to be her patron", "result": "While the kingdom was not fully stabilized yet, this opportunity will solve many of your current problems at once. You only had to fully monopolize Merle and her invention. It will be a lot of work for all of you, but Fulke would probably not mind as he was the one who invited her in the first place. There was also a small childish part in you that wanted to see the machine in full action. You wondered how it would look beyond the restrictions of its drawings. \n\n\n\n\nDue to your excitement building up inside of you, you almost forgot to maintain your public persona as you were about to spring up from your chair. You closed your eyes and quickly forced yourself to regain your composure.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seemed that the time weaver had made the ends of our threads forge together during his blessing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMerle furrowed her brows and rubbed her chin. She didn't seem to be that excited about her offer. Was there something else she had to say or did she want more time to think things through? Fulke chuckled, walked over to her and whispered something in her ear. Her eyes widened for a brief moment before she started to smile as if the time weaver himself had showed up to unwind his threads in front of her. Tears of utmost joy sprung from her as her body swayed back and forth out of dizzying excitement. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, your majesty, you're such a lifesaver. I'll do my best to make the best machine possible. I hope to not disappoint you.\u201d \n\nShe loudly proclaimed as she danced around the room. Her skirt fluttered when she spun around. The loudness of her voice was so jarring to her previously shown persona, that even Eckhart was torn from his work. His dazed eyes quickly sharpened as he reflexively reached out for his sword. It was only due to Fulke's intervention, that he had not pressed the tip of blade against her neck.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, Merle that's enough for now. Don't want you to pass out and all.  I\u2019ll meet ya tomorrow at the Blue Weavel around the usual time to get your contract sorted.\u201d Fulke said. \n\n\n\n\nYou blinked and checked your ears if you had indeed heard such crass words coming from Fulke, the person Eckhart had teased for being even more fond of using theological euphemisms than you. Thus it was really a sight to behold to see the polite Fulke swear like a craftsman while dragging Merle to the exit. You tilted you head. At least that poisonous smile of his never went away. \n\n\n\n\nWhen Merle had left the office and Fulke had returned with an even more haggard appearance than he had before, you immediately jumped into business matters. Rest could always come later and it was actually Fulke had brought this to himself in the first place. \n\n\n\n\nJust as Eckhart was about to retreat to his papers, you forcibly pulled him back with a smile.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDear Fulke, it seems like you owe me and Eckhart a proper explanation for this rather unconventional way of setting up new exclusive contracts. I do understand why you want to monopolize the manufacturing of this machine as its versatile use can prove to be a vital weapon to strengthen our economy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou broadened your smile as you continued. Eckhart nodded along with you.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou see, these contracts cannot be signed with one single hand wave. If we were to suddenly announce it, we would face a lot of resistance from the workshops and perhaps some duchies whose economies relied upon their weaving. We have to lay all the necessary groundwork before we can properly proceed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke let out a exasperated smile. Although the tiredness in his eyes was all too apparent, there was an odd softness to him that was rare to see. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe information dear Merle possessed cannot fall in hands of Essenschaft. It was either to bring her under our wings or to resort to more conventional measures. The poor woman is more trouble than she is worth, but she looked so happy when she told me about her engagement with her childhood friend and then she had dragged me all the way through the city to introduce me to her family.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nEckhart furrowed his brows. One could almost see every small cog move inside his mind as he tried to form his own opinion on the matter. He then looked at the drawings Merle had left behind and slowly shook his head. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't know if this is a really good idea. A contract would not stop other nobles from simply neutralizing her. There is also the risk that some duke will kidnap her family and force her to tell her reveal everything.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\n\nYou knew that Eckhart had wanted to say that it was better to dispose of her first before any information is leaked to others. Fulke gave him a wry smile.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'll take full responsibility of this venture and I will take care of your paperwork for this day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhen Eckhart still didn't look that convinced, Fulke cocked his head. He said the following words without blinking a single moment.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you agree to let me prepare a contract for her, I will make sure that the duchy of Cassisheit will have exclusive rights for the machine for two years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFulke's gaze intensified while Fulke broadened his poisonous smile. Without exchanging a single word the two shook on the deal. You carefully chose not to disclose to Eckhart the fact that Fulke had probably already planned to do these two things in the first place if you agreed to take Merle under your wing. Even the most cruelest part in you wouldn't want to crush the twinkles in Eckhart\u2019s eyes. \n\n\n\n\nThus you let him enjoy his oh so brief vacation and bathe in this temporary happiness. Ignorance was a weakness for many, but in Eckhart's case it might as well be his strength. You hummed as you finished your own paperwork. \n\n\n ", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "You had made your decision.", "result": "And what may that be?
