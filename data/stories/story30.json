Just once, it would be nice to sleep in a dungeon instead of a royal bed. At least then you wouldn't have to wake up to daily sparring sessions with Luca. That boy is way too obsessed with war.\n\n\n     -speak of the brandishing devil.\n\n\n     The unmistakable banging of wood against the door, then the wall, then the bedpost is followed by the less-welcome exclamation that the sun is already half-risen. The extra hour of sleep means that between practice and father's arrival from the hunt there will be no time for breakfast. If they bring back a boar it'll work out for the best I suppose.\n\n\n     \"Marrow, are you ready or not? I've been waiting long enough.\"\n\n\n     \"Calm down Luca, one missed practice means nothing. We're not even at war. Besides, royals don't fight anymore. We make a pretty speech to the front line of the cavalry and stay behind while they charge into battle. At this point, knowing how to fight is just a formality.\"\n\n\n     Luca swung around suddenly with his wooden sword, almost catching you by surprise - but not quite. A quick side-step and the rough blade's arc misses by more than an inch. Seizing the advantage, you rush Luca, and tackle him. The sword's momentum wrenches it from his hand as he is flung backwards to the ground. Knowing your strength in hand-to-hand combat he twists to the side and rolls away on impact, rising and backing away in acknowledgement.\n\n\n     \"Just a formality? A prince should think of nothing but the art of war. When you command the cavalry to charge into battle, if by your lack of planning they do so to their doom, what then? You're left idle, in the open, undefended. Defenseless. You think your fat slob of a father could lead his soldiers into battle and hope to win? He relies on his advisors and military commanders for every little thing, taking it upon himself to do little other than hunt and feast and hunt and feast. He provides no service or protection for his people, relying on their loyalty to the valor of his ancestors while doing nothing to earn some for himself. If this wasn't a hereditary principality he would have been toppled long ago and his usurper would have done his best to eliminate you as his primary threat. What, no words?\"\n\n\n     The truth stung, but less than the alternative of ignoring it: an eventual enemy's spear in the gut. By this point you had made it to the sparring grounds and initiated battle stances. Jab, parry, swing. Lunge, parry, feign into a counter. Repeat until wood feels like lead.\n\n\n     Soon, the sun was glistening overhead and you are both covered with sweat and grime. Heaving, you struggle to battle each other into submission, unwilling as a matter of pride to be the first to call a break. A familiar horn blows in the distance. Father is riding home.     ", "action_results": [{"action": "You're hungry - Go greet your old man: Go to section 2", "result": "     After dousing each other with water from a nearby well, you and Luca quickly change into clean clothes and ride to meet your father at the western end of the village. A thick road travels from the armory-stables for a mile out before it disappears into a thicker forest, lush and with green and full of fattened boars who spend their days scouring the ground for tasty roots or tastier eggs. No doubt, even father's hunting party would have managed to capture a hog worth remembering.\n\n\n    But today, something was off. The riders emerged out of the brush not in a brisk trot, laden down with the spoils of the hunt, but in a faster canter. There was no formation, either. It was as if they scattered in the forest and made individual beelines for the town without regrouping. Some horses came from the left, other the right, seemingly without pattern. And where were the others? More than 40 riders and a handful of servants had left in the early morning. You count barely 20. \n\n\n     Desperately, you scan the armor of the survivors, finally relieved when you see your father's insignia on a black stallion's helmet - a gold-adorned book. Ralin is a respected king, but he cares more about the wisdom of his court than the welfare of his people. Born rich through the hard-earned taxes paid by those loyal to his father, Ralin spent his money not on necessities but on silver vases, rich cloth-of-gold, marbled statues and commissioned paintings. If it came at a reasonable price it was not permitted in his castle. He even purchased original manuscripts in Greek, Latin and Hebrew which he himself was unable to read. Luca once said they wouldn't have been worth reading anyway. He was probably right.\n\n\n     Dismounting with the help of Garik, his man-at-arms, Ralin leads you and the remainder of the entourage into the castle's chamber of reflection, a room with a thrusted stage surrounded on three sides by tiered seating. In the center, a table where maps could be laid out and figurines positioned to discuss and plan strategy. Garik had not always been by Ralin's side. As he was not of noble birth, the king distrusted the soldier when he first came to the court in exile from another land where he fought for the losing side. Having been given the opportunity to make an impression, Garik won favor on the battlefield and once even saved the king's life, becoming one of his most-trusted advisors in the process. Impatiently, you tap him on the shoulder and glare, your eyes asking the only question - 'what happened?' \n\n\n     As he takes his helmet off getting ready to speak you suddenly understand. His eyebrows singed off his face and his left cheek a dry and waxy landscape of red and crisp black. You think, he says, in tandem: \"dragon.\" \n\n\n     \"We saw two beasts today the likes of which we had never seen before. The first was a boar, stronger and faster than a dozen of his brethren. Nine feet long and likely over a thousand pounds, he would have fed the town for a week and a day. We should have given up when after an hour of stalking he proved that he could outrun us, but your father is not a practical man. Once he sees the greatest instance of anything desirable, he demands to have it for himself. Convinced that the great boar would tire before our horses, he pressed us on until we had gone deeper into the forest than ever before. When we finally caught up to the boar, it had been caught itself, its carcass licked clean by the second beast: a fire-breathing dragon. Its nostrils puffing plumes of airy smoke in contentment, it might not have noticed us if we had but turned around and fled, but alas your father was curious about this beast, too. King Ralin always instructs us that knowledge is chiefly important and necessary for he who is ignorant has nothing in his mind that merits being said. As he puts it, 'whoever heard of a silent king?'\"\n\n\n     \"Better a dumb fool than a dead sage\"\n\n\n     \"Indeed. King Ralin sent his most graceful courtier to approach the dragon. Bowing, the courtier respectfully communicated that we meant no harm and wished only to learn the dragon's ways and to receive permission to explore its chosen lair for food and lumber. The dragon, though it obviously understood him, cocked its head to the side as if considering a different question. Making up its mind, in a matter of seconds it ate first the courtier and then the courtier\u2019s horse. Then it realized it was surrounded by all manner of courtiers and horses. Then it realized it was still hungry. We were in disarray. A few brave souls charged the dragon in glorious combat while the rest of us scattered in all directions away from it before fleeing home, painfully aware that we were ill-equipped to fight it. By then too fattened to give chase, the dragon unleashed a circle of fire, roasting alive those closest. I barely escaped with my life. It roared that we were quite tasty and that when hungry again it would come and eat the rest of us. Perhaps it would have been smarter to run the other way but fear overcame us and we fled for the comfort of home. Now it knows where we live, and its coming.\u201d\n\n\n     By now, everyone had taken their seat and Ralin was ready to speak. He had just finished rolling out a meticulously drawn out map of the surrounding lands. He himself was an artist because he considered it very noble and worthy in itself, but in times of war when it was necessary to plan out a strategy, there was great utility in drawing of towns, forests, and surrounding farmland. Looking out into the audience, he paused as if to process the reason for why the room was unusually empty.\n\n\n     \u201cMy friends, today is a terrible day. We have built our town mere miles away from a bloodthirsty dragon. Perhaps if we never approached him we would have continued to farm and hunt and thrive in peace without incident, but we no longer have the luxury of dwelling on the past. The time will come to mourn, but now is the time to survive. According to my books, dragons eat about once a week. Our friends' deaths, as meaningless as they may seem, have bought us a little time to prepare. That being said, I\u2019m open to suggestions as to what to do next.\u201d\n\n\n     Garik, his burnt face still peeling, was the first to offer a suggestion. \u201cWe ride out to kill it. Upon my honor and the honor of my fallen comrades and the honor of all our ancestors, we cannot let this beast live. If we wait for it to come to us, it will choose when and how to engage, slowly roasting us one by one until we no longer have the strength to resist it.\u201d As if to play devil\u2019s advocate, Garik shivered in pain from his wound for a moment until Luca rushed over and steadied him.\n\n\n     \u201cWhile I would normally agree that war is not to be avoided, but is only put off to the advantage of your enemy, in this case I would counsel that it is more prudent to defend from within the castle walls than to fight the dragon on the open battlefield. We have sufficient supplies within the towns\u2019 fortifications to last a year\u2019s time, and there is more than enough static artillery to fend off the dragon, the wielding of which would be difficult in the plains and impossible in the forest. We must handle this danger practically, no matter how much the loss of our brothers may make our blood boil.\n\n\n     The king, motioning for further input and receiving none, turns to you.\n\n\n     \u201cMy son, there are a great number of things which I am good at, and I once thought that by virtue of those skills I was good at all the other skills, too, but I am no great leader. I am an adviser, a counsel, a scribe, but it is not my place to determine our wisest course of action. In this time of great crisis, I recognize my flaws and pass the crown of leadership unto you.

Garik and Luca accompanied you, along with your thirty bravest men. It took about a day to reach the dragon\u2019s lair.\n\n\n     There it was, sleeping.  Even as it exhaled, thin tongues of flame licked the evening air. Garik, unable to control himself, made a move forward while clenching. You hold him back. \u201cCalm yourself. We have but one chance to kill the beast. If it wakes \u2013\u201d\n\n\n     You were blinded by the light reflecting off of Garik\u2019s helmet.

The city needs to be fire-proofed, lookouts need to be stationed in case the dragon arrived earlier than anticipated or if a neighboring kingdom decided to invade in your time of weakness, and guards need to be sent out with the countryside messengers to make sure they aren\u2019t ambushed while informing everyone that they need to get themselves and their family within castle walls.

There is the kingdom of Merrywed to the North and Thundershield to the East. You have long-standing diplomatic relations with the king of Merrywed, and he has previously offered his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage in exchange for an agreement of free trade and mutual protection. You are unsure that the offer of marriage still stands while you are under attack, or even if his soldiers would be enough to drive away the dragon. Alternatively, you could approach the mighty Thundershields and hire yourself a battalion of fearsome but untrustworthy mercenaries.

Papers and various scrolls are spread across the table and scattered across the floor. In a corner is a collection of plates with bits of food still in them. It appears that in this time of struggle your father has gone mad with uncertainty about the kingdom and retreated to the comfort of the writings of long-dead authors, leaving you to take care of those who still live. Pathetic. Noticing you come in, Ralin beckons you over.\n\n\n     \u201cCome, come my son. I\u2019ve found it! Here, take a look at this diagram, and remember that you should always be on guard and keep from falsely persuading yourself of that which you do not know. The practice of arms pertains to both mind and body, and while your men out there practice with useless swords and spears, these letters will be our true salvation. I found it in one of my Greek texts on the art of war.\u201d\n\n\n     Puzzled, you take a look at a drawing of what appears to be sort of an elaborate crossbow.\n\n\n     \u201cIt\u2019s called a gastraphetes, loosely translated as a \u2018belly releaser.\u2019 Our bows are easy to use but are likely too weak to\npierce a dragon\u2019s hide. Rather than pulling on a string, you wield it by pushing down on the slider with your stomach and applying the full weight of your body achieve a level of torsion which would be impossible with only the strength of your arm. Quickly, take it down to the craftsman\u2019s guild and see if they can recreate it in time to use it to shoot down the dragon.\u201d\n\n\n     Impressed beyond words, you embrace your father. Luca, for all his conviction that a prince out to have no other aim or thought than war and its rules and discipline, would never have devoted the time to learn ancient Greek on  the off chance that that it would help defeat dragons. He always argued that evils can be dealt with only when they have been foreseen, but that when permitted to grow in a way that everyone can see them there is no longer a remedy. No one could have predicted the coming of the dragon, and it was now imminently upon us, but through the civic art of letters father found a way to make up for lost time. Perhaps we are not doomed after all.\n\n\nYou rush off to the bowyer\u2019s guild and are relieved when told that the design is well documented and they will be able to quickly construct dozens of such weapons. It will take a long time to reload but the strength of its shot will certainly be several times stronger than what can currently be imparted to even their most supple bows. By week\u2019s end over twenty gastraphetes are stored in strategic positions around the town, half along the perimeter, and thirty soldiers are training day-in day-out to shoot them accurately.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to section 12", "result": "     It actually took a few weeks for the dragon to get make its way to the castle walls. There were plenty of fat sheep in the surrounding farmland, and it reportedly enjoyed setting the already cut wheat grass on fire, and houses too. The people grow restless, but at Luca\u2019s instructions you overcome such difficulties by giving at one time hope to your subjects by reassuring them that when the dragon comes you will kill it and at the same time inspiring fear in them by recounting the gruesomeness of the dragon and inspiring loyalty in those subjects most likely to be bold and dare advocate another course of action. But when it finally comes, you are ready \u2013 and hope it isn\u2019t ready for you.\n\n\n     Soaring from afar, it lands and perches on the city wall as if out of respect surveying its glorious meal before consuming it. It lets out a horrific screech. Maybe it has no honor after all and just wants you to be afraid. You aren\u2019t. A good prince plans for the forseeable, and this was a long time coming. On your command, you signal Garik to charge the dragon with a javelin. His face still visibly scarred from his first encounter with the dragon, he was brave volunteering for the position of aggravating decoy. It was as he put it \u2018a matter of honor. I was welcomed into this kingdom an exile, and returned the favor by saving King Ralin\u2019s life and becoming his loyal servant. I faltered in that service when I let my brethren get eaten by that beast. Now I must end it, or let it end me. To live without making up for my failures would bring too great a shame upon my ancestors.' And he is a brave sight indeed, charging alone a beast two score his size.\n\n\n     But he isn\u2019t alone. As he heaves his javelin at the dragon, catching its attention with a laudable scrape across the lower jaw, it spreads its wings and lunges at him. Never was a threat so great such a perfect target. On cue, the hidden archers all along the city wall let loose a volley of crossbow bolts, aiming for the sinewy leather of the dragons\u2019 wings. No less than seven find their mark, the others glancing off or barely piercing its scaly hide, and the dragon loses its balance in the air and goes into a tailspin, crashing more than forty feet off its mark while Garik scrambles to safety. Enraged and bereft of any easy targets, the dragon lets loose a torrent of fire, engulfing the nearby building and threatening with roasting the archers seated on the rooftops while they scramble to jump off the safer side or leap to a nearby building. But key houses were leveled in preparation, and the fire does not spread.\n\n\n     The remaining archers who are unaffected continue to reload and shoot, the dragon surviving most projectiles but getting intermittently nicked and bruised by the powerful shots of incoming metal. It cab no longer fly away to safety. After it is partially subdued, it attempts to get away but there is no hope. The archers advance, staggering their shots while the others reload so that at no point the dragon has the freedom to move around uncontested.\n\n\n     It was at this point that Garik did something both unnecessarily brave and somewhat stupid. Even though the dragon had little chance of hurting anyone else \u2013 at most it could burn down another few buildings \u2013 Garik could stand its existence no longer. If anyone had the right to deliver the killing blow, it was him. Uttering a guttural yell that answered the dragon\u2019s challenge of when it first reached the city, he charges at the beast with yet another spear, aiming to stab it to the throat. The dragon, warned by his cry, whipps around in time and sucks in a dangerous breath. Had a skilled archer not taken the initiative, Garik would likely have been roasted alive right then and there, but a lone arrow flies true through the cold air and catches the dragon right in its eye, jerking its flaming maw in an angle sharply away from where Garik charges. Seizing the advantage, though burned somewhat by the hot fire, Garik makes a heroic leap and skeweres the dragon downwards through its head. With his remaining strength, he ropes his arms around its throat and strangled it to death, before collapsing to the ground from the combined force of his wounds and exhaustion. The dragon is a threat no more.\n\n\n     Without delay, you shout orders to your people. Put out the fires! Carry the wounded to the infirmary, Garik first! Spread the word that people may return to their surrounding lands! After several hours of cleaning up the battle\u2019s aftermath, as if on cue your people take in unison a deep breath and let out a deafening cheer. The dragon is dead and your people are safe. Like your grandfather, you proved yourself a strong prince who won the loyalty of his subjects. Bribes keep your people in line while the treasury remains full and their lives aren\u2019t threatened, but when you successfully save them from a threat only you could have defended against, they become willing to follow you forever.

Caught off guard, it crashes to the ground with its underbelly exposed to the heavens.

As you know, we lost many brave warriors to the dragon when we first met it in the woods, and perhaps we no longer have the arms to defeat it on our own. You once told me that the there is no foe that the Thundershield warriors cannot overcome. Do you think it would be wise to purchase their help?\u201d\n\n\n     \u201cMy lord, it is true that you have heard me speak of the bravery of the Thundershield warriors. You have also heard my thoughts on mercenaries in general. They are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms he will stand neither firm nor safe. However, in times of crisis we must consider that we no longer have the option to follow the wise course and must instead take risks. Now is one of those times. In our time of weakness we are more likely to be ourselves robbed by the mercenaries we hire, but we must take that risk if you believe there are no viable alternatives.\u201d\n\n\n     \u201cI understand Luca, and I have made up my mind. Please reach out to your contacts within the Thundershields and hire as many men as you think necessary to defeat the dragon.\u201d\n\n\n     \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d\n\n\n     Luca worked fast. In a day, a fair price for the Thundershields\u2019 protection was negotiated: two thousand gold pieces. Steep under any circumstance, but leverage isn\u2019t on your side. You would have given up the entire treasury.\n\n\n     When their army of two hundred brave warriors arrives, you open the city gates, uneasy, and let them in. Your warriors are still in the field protecting your messengers, as only two thirds of your people have made it within the safety of the city walls. News of the dragon making its way closer trickles in, and you know that you have no choice.\n\n\n     The mercenaries, every one looking tougher than the last, each carry an iron shield adorned with a painted thunderbolt, and at least two weapons be they lance, sword, or crossbow. They came prepared.\n\n\n     Their leader \u2013 obvious not because he was in the front but because he was over seven feet tall with arms the size of tree trunks and was the only one wielding a double-bladed axe, clears his throat.\n\n\n     \u201cI am Brute, the leader of this contingent of the mighty Thundershields, and I have come here to collect payment in exchange for slaying a dragon. And which among you is King Morrow?\u201d\n\n\n     Your hand on your hilt, you approach the giant with as straight a back as you can muster, beckoning the three servants carrying the bag of gold payment to follow closely.\n\n\n     \u201cThat would be me. Thank you for coming on such short notice. Here is your payment. Up front and in full. My vassal Garik will lead you to your quarters. I hope everything is to your satisfaction. The dragon is predicted to arrive any day now, I wish your men much rest.\u201d\n\n\n     \u201cYour words are as kind as your gold is generous. It has been a tiresome journey \u2013 we did not want to risk the dragon getting to your gold before we did, ha ha.\u201d\n\n\n     Brute seemed more like a dick than a backstabber. The lesser of two evils you suppose. Chance of betrayal: slim. You sleep easy that night.\n\n\n     The days that followed were generally uneventful. The dragon did not make an appearance, and Brute and his men took the opportunity to enjoy themselves. They drank, they slept, they ate; they pleased themselves of women. At this rate, they would leave as penniless as they came.\n\n\n     Finally, the moment arrives. Heard miles before it came, the dragon sounds more terrifying than even Garik described it. As the flying lizard makes its way to the city, letting loose jets of fire as it approaches, your men hurry the civilians below ground. You half-expected the Thundershields to flee with your gold and leave your people defenseless, but Garik had spent much time with Brute and assured you that he was gruff but honorable. Even mercenaries have a reputation to uphold. Besides, Luca was right. It was a risk you had to take all along.\n\n\n     The real risk is whether the Thundershields are as good as they said they are. They looked the part, and their plan for taking the dragon down was half-decent, but that\u2019s all it was \u2013 a plan. You wouldn\u2019t have to wait long to find out if it worked. Of course, if it didn\u2019t work, you wouldn\u2019t have to wait long for anything because well, you know.\n\n\n     As the dragon descended, Brute gave a great shout and hurled his battle axe at its neck. It flew spinning through the air, but the dragon saw it coming. Clenching its wings and twisting, it just avoided the weapon, but failed to note the incoming projectiles from the other side. While the dragon was distracted by Brute, his five strongest men had thrown immobilizing bolas at the dragon, heavy balls of iron linked together by chains. As they collided with the dragon, they roped around it, tying its legs, its jaw \u2013 one even caught the dragon by the bones protruding out of the ridges of its wings, preventing it from spreading them for further flight. The great beast was grounded. The Thundershields surrounded the dragon as a swarm, fearless and lethal. It tried to light its closest attackers on fire but the warriors spread out in a circle and protected themselves with their giant round-shields, and one of the bolas prevented the dragon from fully opening its maw. Its various limbs entangled, flightless, and surrounded, the dragon fought a hopeless fight to the end. Within minutes it was hacked to pieces, and very much dead.\n\n\n     Only three of Brute\u2019s men were wounded, but not critically so. Grinning, he waved you over to confirm that his men earned their bag of gold and then some, but he was just bragging at this point. The dragon was as still as a rock.\n\n\n     \u201cKing Morrow \u2013 may today serve as proof there is honor in the word of a sellsword. Your people are safe and mine are rich. If ever you find yourself in danger again, send word \u2013 we can always stand to be richer. Farewell.\u201d\n\n\n     As you wave goodbye to this strange group of armed men, you are both relieved and stunned by how well everything turned out. Perhaps Luca was right. Success is half-chance but if you don\u2019t take risks Lady Luck won't even cast the die on your behalf.\n\n\nThe End", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Hire Thundershield Mercenaries: go to section 9b if you kept them at home to fortify the village.", "result": "     With greater reserves of gold than warriors, you decide that your best chance to survive the dragon is to pay someone to kill him for you.
