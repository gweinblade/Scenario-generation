The sky lit up in a blaze of white. The swan held it's breath, waiting for the inevitable thunder.\n\n\nIt came with a angry roar, the very heavens raging against the horrors it had witnessed that night. The swan circled the air still, defying the coming storm. It watched the group on the ground with a hunger that was more predatory than any swan had a right to be.\n\n\nIt was a small band that was huddled in the shelter of the tree below. A old man dressed in white and five men with rippling muscles and grim expressions. They crouched in the fog and waited. To the south, the fires of Hadrian's Wall flickered in the wind - the last outpost separating Roman Britain from the untamed wilds of Caledonia.\n\n\nThe noise of footsteps came through the fog. A weary, uncertain tread. The band of men shifted, excitedly. There was a flash of bare steel.\n\n\nA figure emerged from the darkness, running for the safety of the wall. He war wearing the uniform of a Roman standard-bearer but his Eagle was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he clutched a bundle of rags to his chest as if his life depended on it.\n\n\nAs he approached the swan averted its eyes. It had seen enough blood spilled that day. There was a muffled scream, the sound of a blade, then silence. The Roman lay on the ground, lifeless. The men stood above him. The man in white reached down and pulled the bundle from the dead man's grasp. The rags fell away, revealing a large book.\n\n\nThere was a shriek. A cry that sent a chill through the spines of all who heard it. The old man fell to the ground with a cry, his hands covering his ears. His companions looked at each other, unsure of what happened. Then they gasped. On the man's chest was a large black crow staring at them bleakly. It shrieked once more.\n\n\nThe men turned tail and ran without hesitation. The crow watched them go. Then it shifted. The shape grew and morphed until in its place stood a tall woman in a dark b;ack dress. She bent down and picked up the book which lay beside the old man, unheeded. She looked up at the swan.\n\n\nThe swan flew down wearily and landed in front of her. It changed shape just as she had, taking the form of a handsome man in large white robes. 'Lady Morrigan,' he said, inclining his head.\n\n\n'Lord Angus,' the woman said. She was smiling, but her eyes had a cruel look, as if she was the only one who knew the joke. She held the book out to him. Angus stiffened. 'Destroy it!' he snarled.\n\n\n'Not yet,' Morrigan said. Angus looked at her in disbelief. 'I have seen its fate.' the woman stroked the cover. 'It has its part to play.'\n\n\n'It should never have been made,' Angus said. He looked in disdain at the man at his feet, writhing in agony and staring at him with pleading eyes. 'Druids, they call themselves. I should kill you here and now.'\n\n\n'No!' Morrigan snapped. 'I will deal with him myself.' Angus bared his teeth angrily. 'Ans what would you have me do?' 'I would have you return home, Lord Angus, and leave this wretch to me.' 'And the book?'\n\n\nThe lady smiled again. 'I will hide it well. It will not see the sun for centuries. Not until we have need of it.' Angus looked like he was going to argue, then thought the better of it. 'Very well,' he said. With a flash of light, he was gone.\n\n\nThe Morrigan knelt down beside the terrified druid and smiled. Her black eyes danced with a hidden fire. 'You may think you are lucky. That I have spared you a terrible death. But mark my words: where I am concerned, death is only the beginning.'", "action_results": [{"action": "A new beginning", "result": "'I don't see why I have to go a new school,' you say. Your mom sighs. 'We've been over this before Arthur. It's just an open day. Just take a look around. See if you like it'. It's true. You've been over this before. At least fifty times before. But you still don't get why, after three perfectly good years at your local school, your parents decided to ship you off to some godforsaken corner of the country.\n\n\n'Why Cornwall?' you moan. 'I know it's a good school or whatever, but there are loads of good schools in London. Why take me to a boarding school in Cornwall instead?' Your parents don't reply. You clench your jaw and go back to looking out of the window. The moor stretches away like a barren desert. There's nothing to see but clumps of heather, dotting the landscape. It's been like that for miles.\n\n\n'We're here,' your dad says eventually, breaking the silence. You peer between the seats to catch a glimpse of your new school. It's worse than you imagined. The place looks like a Victorian asylum for the criminally insane. The concrete building stares at you forbiddingly as you drive through to the parking, ivy creeping up the cracked walls.\n\n\nThe front of the school is quite busy, with families milling around. It's odd but most of the children look just like you feel - like they've been dragged here against their will. You turn to look at your parents, who are starting to unload your bags. 'You go ahead,' your mother says. 'We've been told to stay here while you check the place out.' You frown. There's something odd about her manner. She bites her lip indecisively, then steps towards you and gives you a quick hug. You would be embarrassed, but right now you're feeling too scared.\n\n\nShe pulls away and flashes you a smile. 'Go on Arthur. Good luck.'\n\n\nYou're not sure what she means by that, but it isn't helping your mood. You look around the parking. Scattered around are what looks like staff members with clipboards. Most of them are talking to students but two of them seem to be free. The first is a tall slim girl maybe four or five years older than you. The second is a stocky man in his thirties.", "action_results": [{"action": "Approach the girl", "result": "You walk up to the girl. She looks about eighteen. Her long blonde hair is tied back in a ponytail and her eyes are a deep sea-blue. She flashes you a smile as you approach her.  'Hi! Welcome to Grovewood. What's your name?'\n\n\n'Arthur Drake,' you say.\n\n\n'Aged fourteen?'\n\n\n'Yes.'\n\n\n'Okay,' she ticks you off on her clipboard. She hands you a blank white sticker. 'Here,' she says. 'Write your name on that. Then go through those doors and follow the corridor on your left. There'll be a big hall on your right. Just wait there.'\n\n\nYou go ahead like she says. At the entrance to the school you stop and look back. You parents are standing by the car. Your dad gives you a wave. You don't return it. You don't know why, but something about this whole situation seems off.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go in to the school", "result": "You walk in through the doors and stop. Woah! The interior is nothing like what you imagined. The place seems to be built entirely from oak and granite. The outside might look like Broadmoor but the inside looks like a medieval castle. Torches in iron brackets shed a warm glow over the room. The walls are decorated with rich tapestries. Suits of armour flank the entrance, their crossed halberds suspiciously sharp. What sort of a school is this?!\n\n\nYou walk slowly to the corridor, taking in the details of the room. You can't help but admit, this place is AWESOME!\n\n\nThe corridor is the same, lined with tapestries. They show scenes from battle, with dragons and knights in full armour but they seem strangely modern. For one thing, you doubt that medieval knights carried around mobile phones. At the end of the corridor you come to a large doorway. The sign above says it's the Stone Hall. From inside there is a loud hum of people talking. You go through the door\n\n\nThe Stone Hall is a massive room, but with no stone in sight. There must be at least a couple of hundred people milling around inside. You take a deep breath. Right. Time to go make some friends.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Stone Hall", "result": "Most of the kids are in large groups in the middle of the room.

You make for the biggest group you can see in the middle of the room. When you try squeezing past a couple of people you stumble. As you're regaining your balance, someone bumps into you and trips you over. 'Watch it!' someone says. You land heavily on the floor.\n\n\nA redhead girl is standing in front of you. 'Why don't you watch where you're going,' she snaps. She's holding an empty plastic cup in her hands. It's contents are deposited. on the floor, mere inches from your trousers. You move out of the way quickly before your clothes get soaked.", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell her it wasn't your fault", "result": "'It wasn't my fault,' you say.

He's athletic and square-jawed with sandy hair and deep green eyes. 'Connor Woodridge.'\n\n\n'Arthur Drake,' you reply.\n\n\n'So, are you excited about coming to Grovewood?' Connor asks.\n\n\n'Actually I'd never even heard about this place till last week,' you admit.\n\n\n'Same here,' Connor says. His tone seems a bit strange. You look at him suspiciously and he looks away quickly.\n\n\n'Connor!' Another boy comes up and slaps Connor on the back heartily.\n\n\n'Hello David,' Connor says, grinning. He turns to you. 'Er.. Arthur, meet my friend David. David, Arthur.'\n\n\n'Nice to meet you Arthur,' Davis says, still grinning. He and Connor are so alike they could be brothers except David's hair is black instead of blonde.  'So, are you excited about coming to Grovewood?'\n\n\nConnor coughs. 'Arthur and I were just saying how neither of us had ever heard of this school before.'\n\n\n'Ah, okay,' David says. 'No, neither had I.' He grins. 'Still excited though.'\n\n\nBefore you can comment on their cross talk act, a hush falls over the crowd. You guess you'll be getting your answers right now anyway.", "action_results": [{"action": "The bell rings", "result": "The large double doors at the far end of the room creak open. A man walks through. He is tall and gaunt, with grizzled hair and a black coat that makes him look like an especially morose funeral director.\n\n\n'Good evening.' His voice is quiet but it carries throughout the room. 'We're ready for you now so please follow me through into the next room.' He turns around and walks out, leaving an expectant silence. Then the silence breaks and all two hundred kids move in unison towards the doors. In the chaos you look for someone you recognise.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go in with Connor", "result": "You catch sight of Connor and stick to him. The doors lead to a large hall with rows of chairs. The room is circular with four large doors, including the one you have just entered through. The walls are again lined with a series of swords and other assorted weapons. A large vaulted glass ceiling gives a view of the stormy grey sky outside.\n\n\nYou sit down in a chair next to Connor. The funeral director waits for everyone to be seated. His expression could be carved in stone. Finally, when the noise has died down he takes a step forwards. 'Hello. And welcome to Grovewood College. I am Aurelius Glaston, the headmaster of this school. I understand you have many questions.'  His grim expression turns into a wry smile. 'So let us begin...'\n\n\nCRASH!\n\n\nYou jerk you head up in time to see the glass ceiling shatter into a thousand fragments. The iron supports holding the ceiling up break away. You look at the headmaster, who is staring at the falling struts, frozen to the spot. You want to scream but you can't. The whole thing crashes down on him, crushing him beneath tonnes of met and stone.\n\n\nThe sky, dark as it was, is now obscured by the immense shadow plummeting into the room. It lands in the centre of the circular space. You can't believe what you're seeing. The shadow raises its reptilian head and surveys the wreckage. Then it opens its mouth and flames fill the air.", "action_results": [{"action": "Dragon attack!", "result": "The room is in chaos. The platform with the teachers is buried under a pile of rubble. The four massive exits are blocked off. And in the middle of the room, spewing flames into the night sky is an honest to goodness dragon!\n\n\nIts body is about the size of a large SUV and blood red. Two enormous, outstretched wings slash through the air dangerously as it turns, as does the four-metre-long tail. Its reptilian yellow eyes shine maliciously in the firelight.\n\n\nYou watch as a group of kids run up to the weapons on the walls and pull them off before circling the dragon warily. Some others try to control the crowd, ushering people towards one exit and starting to clear the rubble away. And there, right in front of the dragon, is a tall girl with long blonde hair standing rooted to the spot.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join the armed efforts", "result": "You swear under your breath. Even as you rush to the wall you know you must be crazy. You grab a hefty looking broadsword and shield. The sword is much heavier than you expected but at least its balanced. You've only ever used lighter fencing foils but they would be useless against that thing.\n\n\nThe dragon stops spewing fire and looks around the room. It catches sight of the blonde girl you noticed earlier. It opens its mouth in a sinister grin.\n\n\n'Hey!' You bang the sword on your shield noisily. The dragon whips its head around to face you. Great. You have its attention. Now what? There's more clanging from your left. The dragon turns again to face Amy who copies your trick. Soon the room is full of sonorous drumming as the armed kids take it in turns to distract the beast. You see the blonde girl scramble off towards the exit.\n\n\nThe dragon has its back to you now. The massive tail flicks from side to side, keeping you at bay. You look to your left and see Amy looking at you expectantly. If one of you can get past the tail, you can jump onto the dragon's back and take control of the situation.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the lead", "result": "You decide to take the lead. You drop the shield. Without it you'll be defenceless but it'll slow you down, and right now speed is all you've got. You run towards the dragon, watching its tail whipping dangerously back and forth. One. Two. Three. Jump! You vault over the tail as it passes underneath you and land on the dragon's lower back. It senses the weight and turns its head but by then you've run up to its shoulders and as it twists to face you, you swing the blade, driving it along a deadly arc into the dragon's neck.\n\n\nThe dragon roars in pain. It twists as it falls, trapping you under an outstretched wing. You gasp, winded. You're still gripping the sword, which is wedged between the scales on the dragon's neck. The dragon can't move without pushing it in further into the flesh. It watches you through slit-like pupils. One push. That's all it will take.", "action_results": [{"action": "Slay the dragon", "result": "You grip the sword tighter. The dragon bares its teeth as it realises what you are going to do. It opens it's jaw to spray you with flames. With a wild yell you drive your sword forwards. The dragon gasps. The evil eyes grow dim.\n\n\nA sound echoes through the room, gaining in volume. There is a strange sensation in your gut. The weight of the dragon on your legs disappears. You blink, then start in shock. The rubble is gone. So is the dragon. On the platform, applauding, are the headmaster and the rest of the assembled teachers. You stare at them. So does everyone around you.\n\n\nThe headmaster steps forwards. 'Well done all of you,' he says. Gone is the funereal air. Instead, he beams at the uncomprehending faces that surround him. 'If you had questions before, I am sure you have many more now. So without any further drama, let us have some explanations.", "action_results": [{"action": "Welcome to the school", "result": "The crowd is quickly separated into two groups by the teachers before being led away. You are put in the same group as Amy. You assume that's a good thing. When you're out of the room the headmaster confirms your suspicion.\n\n\n'Well done,' he says, looking around at the forty-odd group of kids that have been selected. 'You have passed the first test.' He sees the disbelieving expressions in the group and smiles. 'Yes, that was a test.'\n\n\nHe continues talking as he leads you down the corridors. 'By now you might have guessed that Grovewood college is not a \"normal\" school. Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth. You see, here you will not learn English or chemistry or geography. At least, not like you have been taught before. Here you will learn how to wield words like weapons. You will experiment with potions that can give life or take it in a single drop. You will learn the very nature of the land you stand on.' He stops as he reaches a large door and turns to face you. 'In short, my prospective students, you will learn magic!'\n\n\nThe crowd bursts into speech. The headmaster smiles and raises his hands in a conciliatory gesture. Silence returns. 'I know it's a lot to take in,' he says, 'so I'll try to clear some things up. Yes, the dragon you saw was an illusion. No, nobody would have been hurt. I was in control all the time. And yes, your parents do know.'\n\n\nThe crowd start talking again but he waves them into silence. You can't believe it either. Your parents knew? But then you remember how oddly they were acting in the morning. 'All your parents will be ex-students of either this school or the hundreds of others that are situated around the world. If you choose to enrol here, you will be joining an exclusive group of people who are part of a legacy that stretches back thousands of years.'\n\n\n'And if we don't want to enrol?' someone asks.\n\n\nGlaston smiles sagely. 'Then we do the same to you as we did to those who didn't pass. We simply let you forget you were ever here. You wake up in your normal lives, with no recollection of today.' He pauses to let that sink in. 'Does anyone wish to leave?' he asks quietly.", "action_results": [{"action": "Choose to leave", "result": "Really? A chance like that and you'd choose to leave?

You still can't believe what you've got yourself into. It's been a week since the fight with the dragon. A week since you joined Grovewood. You look around the dorm room.\n\n\nIt's a circular room with stone walls. It would feel like a dungeon if it weren't for the wide bay windows, letting in the Cornish sun. On the ceiling, the word 'Falias' is emblazoned in large letters,circling a picture of a rock.\n\n\nThe beds - large wooden ones - arranged along the walls. Your bed is the one closest to the entrance. Five beds, five roommates. You look at the sheet you were given with your induction pack listing the new students joining the school that year along with their photographs. First year, Falias house. Arthur Drake. You smirk at the awful photo they've taken. Connor Bardell, David Farrier, Jack Liu and Alan Loughlin. Then there are the girls: Amy McPherson, Emily Fitzroy, Charlotte Booker, Rowan Harriet and Finley o'Brian.\n\n\nYou sigh. You met some of them on the day of the dragon fight. You guess you'd better get to know them. You'll be stuck with them for the next four years, after all.\n\n\nYou pull on your jacket and head down to the common room, grabbing your notebook on the way. The other are already there, sitting around a table chatting amongst themselves. You recognise them from their photographs. There are two chairs free, one between Jack and Alan, the other between Rowan and Charlotte.", "action_results": [null, {"action": "Sit with Alan and Jack", "result": "You sit down between Jack and Alan. Jack is tall and well-built. He's talking to Connor and Amy excitedly about the school. Alan, sitting on your other side, is short with glasses that give him a slightly spaced-out look, not helped by the fact that he is actually staring off into space.", "action_results": [{"action": "Join in the conversation with Jack", "result": "'That's a pretty tough selection criterion,' Amy says. 'It would rule out pretty much half the world's population.'\n\n\n'Not really,' Jack replies. 'After all, I qualify for it.'\n\n\n'What are you guys talking about?' you say, joining in.\n\n\n'The school application,' Amy says. 'Apparently the school only accepts kids with Celtic blood.'\n\n\n'Celtic?' You frown. 'That would explain all the Irish and Scottish kids, I guess. But...'\n\n\nJack shakes his head. 'Not the modern kind of Celtic. The ancient Celts were a civilisation that covered pretty much all of Europe, from Britain in the West, down to Spain, West to Germany, even as far as Greece.'\n\n\n'But that was thousands of years ago,' Connor says. 'In those days, the Celts were exposed to large quantities of magic from a place called the Otherworld. That is what gave them their magical prowess. The magic was strongest in the British Isles, especially Ireland. The barrier between this world and the Otherworld was said to be weakest here, so plenty of residual magic for the Celts to use.'\n\n\n'So the school only teaches magic to descendents of the original Celts,' you guess. 'But then... Amy's right, isn't she? That would exclude most of the world's population.'\n\n\n'Not really,' Jack says. 'The Celts were a pretty active lot. A bunch of them were in armies with the Romans and even with Alexander the great. Those guys went everywhere from Africa to the Middle east and even up into Asia.' He grinned. 'That's how I'm here. I could probably trace my ancestry back to some guy in Alexander's entourage.'\n\n\n'Then of course there was the British Empire,' Connor says. 'That really spread the Celtic-ness around. Sure, you'll probably find some tribes out in the Amazon rainforest of someplace that couldn't claim a Celtic heritage, but then those guys usually have magic of their own too.'\n\n\nYou try to make sense of this. This has just raised more questions than it answered. Before you can ask any more though, the door to the common room opens. An older student comes in and grins at you. 'Come on down guys. It's time for your induction tour.'", "action_results": [{"action": "Tour through the school", "result": "The guy who came to fetch you, Owen, leads you down to the big circular hall and then through another stone passageway. You go through the doorway at the end and stop in shock. In front of you stretches what looks like an entire village. You can't believe it. You remember the drive up to the school. There was nothing around for miles. It's impossible.\n\n\n'It's the magical barrier around the place,' Owen says, noticing your expression. 'The only way in or out of this place is through the school.' He leads you to the centre of the village, to a clearing where the students from the other houses are already gathered.\n\n\nAs you arrive, a group of teachers emerge from the school and walk to the middle of the clearing. Glaston walks to the front, accompanied by a younger man with the same stony expression and salt-and-pepper hair. 'That's Ambrose Bartholomew,' Rowan whispers to you. 'He's the other headmaster. He's the one who set up the school in the first place.'\n\n\n'Good evening,' Glaston says, 'and welcome to your first day at Grovewood.' He pauses. 'You all know that this school trains your magical abilities. What some of you may not know is that this magic is tied to the ancient Celtic traditions. The magic that you will be using comes from the land that you step on, the air that you breathe, and the very blood that runs through you.\n\n\n'But this magic is not for parlour tricks. The skills you learn will be vital to your future. You see, the world that we live in is at war, constantly invaded by the creatures that inhabit the Celtic Otherworld. The skills you learn will help you battle against these invaders, and maintain the order of our universe.' He pauses again. 'There are three classes to choose from at your time in Grovewood; the classes that the ancient Celts themselves implemented - the druids, the knights and the bards.'\n\n\nGlaston smiles. 'Now I could stand here and tell you about the school and the classes and the rest. But I think it will be more interesting for you to find out for yourself. So go ahead and explore the grounds as you wish. You have maps included in your notebooks. Dinner will be served at the pavilion in two hours.'

You head for that with Amy and Jack, curious to find out exactly what it's like. It turns out to be a large circular pit about fifty metres across. The sides are sloping with steps to sit on and the floor is covered with red dirt. A row of straw dummies has been set up to one side, beside which stands a girl in armour wielding two short wooden swords.\n\n\n'Hello there,' she calls as you walk down to her. 'I'm Jennifer. Welcome to the Arena.' You recognise her as you approach her. She's the girl who was taking names in the parking lot when you first came to the school.\n\n\n'This is where you can come too practise your fighting,' she tells you. 'It's always open so you can come over whenever there isn't a class going. You can practise with friends or book a session with a trainer if you'd like. The more you practise, the better you'll get so it's good to come by if you're free at any time. You'll usually find me down here anyway if you have any questions.'\n\n\n'Where do we get the swords from?' Amy asks, obviously excited at the prospect of fighting.\n\n\n'You can get practice swords from the stores,' Jennifer says, pointing her sword in the direction of a small shed-like structure to one side. 'But those can usually only be used during lessons. If you want to practise outside of class, the armoury is in the town square. You can go there and get all sorts of weapons and items. For now let's see how good you are with a wooden sword.' She hands Amy and Jack the swords and lets them go at the dummies, shouting instructions on how to hack and slash at them.\n\n'By the way,' she says turning to you, 'I was at the dragon fight last week.

About ten minutes away from the village square, the flat scenery gives way to what is essentially a forest of mainly oak trees. Some of them are massive, with trunks as wide across as you are tall. They must be hundreds of years old. As you approach the grove, you see Rowan and David talking to a tall girl who looks like she's an older student. Her name, printed on the badge she's wearing, is Sarah.\n\n\n'The grove is the most important part of the school,' she tells them. 'It's how the school got its name in the first place.'\n\n\n'How old are the trees?' David asks. 'Some of them look ancient.'\n\n\n'Some of them are well over a thousand years old,' Sarah says. 'Some are even pushing two thousand, though it's hard to be certain. Anyway, those are much further into grove. The ones around here are maybe two hundred or three hundred at most.'\n\n\n'So why is the grove sacred?' you ask.\n\n\n'Apparently the grove was used as a meeting place by druids for their ceremonies back in the Roman period,' Sarah explains. 'At least, that's what Dr Bartholomew says. You see, druids work with magic that comes from the land itself. When you're closer to nature like in this grove, it's easier to channel that magic effectively so it's where our powers are at their strongest. This is also where we teach the druid stream classes.

At least, you assume it's a woman. It's difficult to tell with the suit of armour. 'Hello,' she says. 'Sorry about the armour. It's a bit stuck. Just hammering it out a bit.' She lifts up the visor, revealing a definitely feminine face. 'You're first years, aren't you?' You tell her that you are. 'Excellent!' she says. 'I'm Raine, the school armourer. Also the school blacksmith. And the weapons expert. Basically, anything to do with weapons, you come to me.'\n\n\n'I was actually hoping to get some armour made,' Jack says.\n\n\n'Well, I'll make you anything you want - for a price, that is.' Raine tries to come around the corner but gets stuck between two of the displays. She tries to pull free, then leaves it and stays where she is. 'Well now, I can give you a basic set off the rack or you can get one custom made. Of course, if you want, I can show you how to make weapons yourself. It'll be cheaper, but you'll have to gather the supplies yourself. It won't be as good as mine either, but you might get lucky and you'll improve over time.

A wide circular reception stands in the middle of the building, in a sort of atrium, manned at the moment by Owen, the older student who led you down from the common room. The walls of the atrium are formed by tall shelves of books, arranged radially around the reception. A set of stairs leads to a balcony which overlooks the entire library floor.\n\n\n'Hello there,' Owen says, leaning on the desk as you walk up to him. 'Welcome to the Grovewood library. It's not the largest of it's kind in the world, but it's one of the best staffed and it boasts the largest groupp of archivists of any library in the world.'\n\n\n'How many do you have?'

'What's an archivist?'\n\n\n'Well, in the old days the Celts never wrote anything,' Owen explains. 'It was considered a terrible thing to write down any of the Celtic secrets so all stories were passed on entirely by word of mouth. As Celtic literature grew over the years it became harder and harder to do that. Bards had to train for increasingly longer periods of time to memorise everything until finally they just stopped trying. Now there are very few bards who even attempt to do something like that. They're called archivists.'\n\n\n'So how do you have half an archivist?'\n\n\n'Oh, that's me. I'm still training, but maybe twenty, thirty years down the line I'll have it done.' He looks at your horrified faces and laughs. 'Don't worry, archivists have probably the longest training times of all the bards and I'm an especially slow learner. Archivists are pretty awesome, but there's all kinds of bards specialising in all kinds of techniques. Everyone thinks we're a bit weak and artsy compared to the knights and the druids but back in the day the bards were just as important as the chiefs of the tribes. We're more powerful in battle than the druids and more intelligent than the knights - though don't tell anyone I said that.' Owen . 'Keep it in mind when you choose your stream.
