The Adventurer is a tough little ship, large enough for a Crew of 30 and with enough space to hold 30 days worth of supplies. Though you are only twenty years old you have already received the rank of Commander in recognition of your superb ability and are widely respected as one of the greatest sailors of your homeland, The Kingdom of the Three Islands.\n\n\nThe World of Magellan on which you live is mostly water and for this reason the people of The Three Islands have a rich naval tradition. Gunpowder is a recent invention and though your ship is armed with four cannons and all of your crew carry muskets these are slow to load and highly inaccurate when fired making the sword your crew's primary weapon. A dozen Colonies have been established on Islands beyond your people's borders but these vary from well-organized and thriving settlements to frequently-massacred outposts of civilization.\n\n\nYour ship can only carry a maximum amount of Food for 30 days, which will make finding and obtaining sources of Food your top priority. If you ever run out of Food (your Food number reaches 0) then you and all your Crew will starve to death and die. You will almost certainly lose Crew members on this military expedition and you must take care that your Crew number never falls to 0: that will mean that you and all your Crew are dead.\n\n\nThough not as important as during your previous voyage you will still want to make your journeys in the shortest number of Days possible. Queen Anne-Marie is keen to encourage efficiency and rewards those Captains who complete their voyages swiftly with additional Crew and Food. You are sailing as one of the ten Ships in the War Fleet, commanded by Queen Anne-Marie, and you will find details of your fellow Captains and Commanders in the List of War Fleet Officers provided below.\n\n\nSurviving this voyage will not be as easy as it may appear... those who do will receive 1 Score Point while those who run out of Crew or Food during their voyage and die win no Score Points. Your Score will be shown if you leave a comment when you have finished this story. As in previous adventures you might find it useful to make a map as you sail as the information might be useful for future voyages and adventures in these waters...\n\n\nSo good luck reader, make wise and strategically sound choices and with a little luck, a good course and a fair wind you might live to see your homeland again!", "action_results": [{"action": "Click here to begin your adventure (pick up the List of War Fleet Officers first!)", "result": "Queen Anne-Marie looks round at you and her other assembled Officers with a steely gaze, as if measuring each officer's worth.\n\n\n\"Your voyages so far have accomplished great things\", she announces. \"Many Islands have been colonized, many more islands discovered and I am confident that with sailors such as you under my command many more will be found. We do however have a problem: the Lapau as they call themselves. A vast confederation of allied tribes by force or reason we must come to a favorable treaty with them and establish where the border between their lands and ours lies. To do this we must explore their islands, see where they are, how strong they are and how wealthy they may be.\"\n\n\nYou glance round at the other officers, both those you know and those you don't. Grey-bearded and softly-spoken Commander Cuthrew is gazing intently at Queen Anne-Marie as she speaks, nearby Donald Trevers is cleaning his spectacles nervously. Your friend Esme Hale, the attractive fire-haired maiden of the sea, catches your eye and winks at you. You smile back but quickly pay attention as Queen Anne-Marie gives you a disapproving glance.\n\n\n\"During The Great Race and The Second Race most of our problems were caused by lack of Food,\" she declares. \"I have had those of our Colonies which lie in our path well-stocked with food and my vessel, the Monarch of the Sea, has been specially constructed to carry vast amounts of Food which I will allocate among you all based on your performance and speed during this voyage. We must try to learn from our past experiences.\"\n\n\nAnne-Marie pauses again and you quickly glance round at those Officers you are not personally familiar with. Thomas Finch and Richard Quarrel stand behind the Queen, Finch is straight-backed and hard-looking while Quarrel has the face and manner of a pickpocket. More impressive are the cousins Swift and Mason, both fair-haired and smart-looking young ladies. Standing aloof to one side and scowling at something is the tomboyish Eva Freer. With her short purple hair and wiry, slender figure she's quite good looking you think...\n\n\n\"The first leg of our voyage will be south through the Southern Passage, past Trever's Island and we will rendezvous on Burnt Island,\" Queen Anne-Marie declares. \"We will sail at dawn tomorrow morning and woe betide you if ten Days from now we are not all anchored off Burnt Island. I know you are all good Sailors and if you serve me well then together we can make this world ours... very well. See to your ships Commanders and we will sail on the dawn tide.\"\n\n\nThe next day the early morning fog is just clearing as you order the anchor raised aboard the Adventurer in readiness to sail out of Golden Sands. The packed crowds on the quay remind you of when you set sail on The Great Race around the world but then the crowds were cheering while today they are oddly subdued and silent... you sense that deep down everyone knows the War Fleet has not been assembled for diplomatic reasons and there are many husbands and fathers aboard it's ships that will not come home again.\n\n\nSome individual ships are still capable of raising a cheer, your Adventurer is one and when Hale's Merry Company sets sail the cheers and shouts are deafening. The Sea Ghost rapidly pulls away from the harbor, vanishing to the south, followed in a group by The Royal Escort, Indefatigable and The Monarch of the Seas. The cousins Swift and Mason are sailing together and you watch with a smile as Trever's Lucky nearly collides with Freer's Gambler prompting a string of imaginative and and biologically detailed insults from that colorful Commander.

He is still in sight when you reach the island that was named after him after he spent some time marooned there after one of his previous ship's caught fire and sank. The pleasant tropical island is now inhabited by a small village of colonists who grow crops and fish. You are pleased to see Esme Hale's Merry Company is already anchored there, her crew loading barrels of fish aboard her ship.\n\n\n\"Esme, you will never reach Burnt Island if you stop for food every time you are hungry,\" you shout to her when the Adventurer pulls alongside. Hale laughs.\n\n\n\"What's the point of rushing?\" she asks. \"I'd rather get there in good shape than rush and miss out on all this nice fresh fish.

You are soon joined by the cousins Mason and Swift and up close you can tell they are related as both have fair hair and pale complexions. Hale, Trevers and finally Freer arrive, up close she is even more attractive than she was in Golden Sands. When you are all assembled Queen Anne-Marie enters and the Council begins.\n\n\n\"The closest Lapau-inhabited island that we know of lies directly Southeast of here,\" she declares. \"The first thing we need to do is sail there and see if the Natives are willing and able to discuss the relations between our two Nations in a meaningful way.

Anne-Marie tries presenting gifts like expensive jewellery to the Lapau but after examining them briefly they hand them back. The Lapau offer no gifts in return and as the meeting drags on without either side able to understand the other they mutter among themselves and give you all unfriendly looks.

Hundreds of little one-man canoes surround the Fleet's ten ships like ants around sandwiches and brightly-painted figures are rapidly climbing up onto the decks, jabbing their spears through the sides of the ships or firing arrows up at them. Aboard all the ships men are grappling as spears thrust, swords swing, muskets fire and men are cut down screaming and gurgling to fall to the decks or into the sea.\n\n\nThe Adventurer was not anchored close to the Island and consequently seems to have received little attention but still a dozen Lapau Natives have hauled themselves on deck and are grappling with your Crew, three of your men already lie motionless on the deck. Drawing your sword you order your men to fire their muskets and as guns bang the Lapau Warriors are killed or dive from the ship to the safety of the sea. With the Adventurer secure at least you look round and find things are worse for most of the other ships in the Fleet.\n\n\nA lot worse.\n\n\nCommander Trever's ship Lucky is on fire: blazing fiercely and sinking as the flickering flames light up the silhouettes of men grappling and fighting on her decks. Commander Freer's ship Gambler is also sinking fast: pierced by dozens of spears it's sailors are diving from it's decks into the sea all around. Commander Hale's Merry Company is being swarmed by so many Lapau it seems impossible the ship does not sink under it's wait. A row of several cannons aboard the Monarch of the Sea boom into life but it too is heavily overrun and trying to get to her aid the Indefatigable has also come under heavy attack and a small fire has broken out amidships.\n\n\nNot all is chaos however: the Sea Ghost is under sail and gliding smoothly through the chaos delivering organized volleys of musket fire at the thickest groups of Lapau and the Royal Escort, though still at anchor is also delivering volleys of musket and cannon fire. Anchored nearby, like you the Explorer and Maverick have also only been lightly attacked and are trying to clear their decks for action. As your sailors manage to hoist the anchor the wind fills your sails and the Adventurer glides forward.\n\n\nYou can scarcely believe it: the whole War Fleet has fallen victim to a night attack from hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of deadly spear and bow-armed Lapau Warriors in canoes!

You spot the distinctively-dressed figure of Anne-Marie calmly aiming and firing muskets at the attackers, which are being loaded and passed to her by two of her sailors.\n\n\nAs you pull alongside your men fire a volley of musket and cannon shots into the Lapau that cuts down most of the great crowd on the main deck.

Occasionally a musket shot rings out as a wounded Lapau is discovered and killed. At noon you and the other surviving officers are summoned to a Council of War aboard the Monarch of the Sea.\n\n\nCommander Donald Trevers is dead, killed along with the rest of his Crew when the Lucky's gunpowder store exploded. Esme Hale is devastated: two thirds of her crew have been killed in the fighting and sitting there white-faced with a bloodied bandage wrapped around a hip wound she looks the very picture of misery. Eva Freer has been wounded too, stabbed in the shoulder as she swam to safety from the sinking Gambler, only a handful of Crew have survived. Anne-Marie and Quarrel have also suffered heavy losses amongst their crew: altogether nearly one hundred men or a third of the War Fleet's manpower have been killed. The fact that the Lapau suffered similar casualties is small consolation.\n\n\n\"None of us expected this attack,\" Anne-Marie says grimly when you have all gathered. \"The Lapau have declared war on us and from now until they surrender we will show them no mercy. We need to make new plans though: this Fleet has been badly damaged and needs to refit and reinforce itself. There is not a danger that the Lapau will attack our colonies.

Commander Hale and myself will sail back to Golden Sands to get more men and supplies and to have Commander Hale's wound treated. We will be gone about three weeks.

There is no one but you I would entrust this mission to.\"\n\n\nAnne-Marie glances round at the rest of you. \"Commander Finch, I want you and Commander Quarrel to co-ordinate an attack to destroy all Lapau resistance on this island and convert it into a base from which we can launch our assault on other Lapau Islands. Rely on musket and cannon fire, keep a safe distance and the Natives here will be destroyed. Commanders Swift and Mason, I want you to ensure our colonies are safe: sail with me and Commander Hale as far as Trever's Island and then when he turn north sail west to Sandy Island and then back to here where you will render Commanders Finch and Quarrel any assistance they might need.\"\n\n\nFinally Anne-Marie turns to you and Freer. \"Commander Freer, you will join Commander Trapa aboard the Adventurer, your remaining Crew will be assigned to Commander Hale's ship. You will assist Commander Trapa in any way he sees fit.\"\n\n\nFreer starts to protest angrily but Anne-Marie cuts her short with an angry clap of her hands.\n\n\n\"I have given you an order Commander. It will be obeyed. Commander Trapa... the absence of myself and Commander Cuthrew you will command the Fleet until either myself ot Commander Cuthrew return. Commander Freer will assist you. You can either remain here and co-ordinate the assault on this island with Finch and Quarrel or you can accompany Swift and Mason on their voyage to ensure our Colonies are safe.

She was presumed lost but now it seems she has been found and adopted by the Lapau.\n\n\n\"I have come here to translate the words of Al-Capu, King of the Lapau and of his son Al-Balu,\" she says gesturing to the tough old warrior and his handsome son. The King of the Lapau speaks in the deep ponderous tones of his people while Lovett provides a translation.\n\n\n\"Al-Capu knows your heart Queen. He is tired of fighting. Many of his warriors are killed. You have taken all his villages and all his lands but Matan. Al-Capu is tired of the war you have waged upon him and his heart is sad. If you leave him in peace he will fight with you no more.\"\n\n\n\"Al-Capu promises not to attack our islands if we do not attack his?\" Anne-Marie asks.\n\n\n\"It was never the intention of Al-Capu to harrass your colonies,\" Lovett replies. \"Those were the actions of ambitious petty chiefs and young warriors. If you leave the Lapau alone they will leave you alone.\"\n\n\n\"That is not enough,\" Anne-Marie replies. \"I too have lost too many warriors. We demand land as recompense.\"\n\n\nAl-Capu considers this when Lovett translates and gestures to his fleet of canoes.\n\n\n\"If they fight with you perhaps you will win or perhaps the Lapau will triumph,\" Lovett translates. \"Either way many will die and both of us will lose. But if you sail away we will have a lasting peace which will be sweeter than any victory in battle. Trade routes can be established and our people can learn much from each other.\"\n\n\nAnne-Marie tries one last time. \"Your warriors attacked our Fleet without warning when we first visited you in peace,\" she insists. \"We deserve something at least for that.\"\n\n\nAl-Capu and Al-Balu talk rapidly among themselves for some time before Lovett what they say.\n\n\n\"Prince Al-Balu was leading his annual tour of his kingdom with his escort when he learned of your ships off his father's lands. Perhaps his attack on you was over hasty but he feared you meant to attack his father's lands. To ensure a lasting peace between our two peoples King Al-Capu will give his son Al-Balu and myself to you as hostages to live for one year and will now provide your Fleet with food to help you return to your own lands.
