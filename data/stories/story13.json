You could spend hours upon hours at the lake in the woods near your house. You love the serene glass-like surface of the lake and the wild flowers along the bank. Everyday you go out and lay a blanket in the grass and lie there for hours upon hours. The lake was far enough into the woods that it felt like your own little universe there. The lake was very small, and willow trees draped their dangling branches around the edges of the lake. But the main reason you loved it there so much, you could never quite explain. There was an energy to the place. It felt powerful and magical to you, like it belonged in another world. \n\n\nToday you decide to bring a book with you to the lake to read. Every day after work you change out of your uniform and take your  hair out of it's harsh bun. You feel that the peacefulness of the lake and the stress you associate with your job do not mix. Then you grab your old ratty blanket, the one that has spent every day with you at the lake. You always keep it in the closet right by your front door. You spend very little time in your house when you get home from work. What you really look forward to at the end of each day is your little hideaway. Even though you have been there thousands of times before, you always rush to get out the door. But today felt different. While you usually rush there because you love the lake, today it felt like you were practically being pulled to the lake by a force outside you control.\n\n\nWith your book in your hand and the blanket under your arm, you are finally ready to leave.

As you walk into the area, you feel as if you have entered a small sanctuary, a peaceful area hidden away from the chaos of the world. You sigh deeply. You feel content as you lay your blanket down at the lake's edge. There is a patch of grass that is permanently squished down from you putting your blanket there every day.\n\n\nYou place your book gently on your blanket. You are very excited to read this book. It is about what certain mythologies believe about animals. It is like reading fairy tales, but the animals are real and you can see them everyday!

In fact, you have always thought this place was.... otherworldly.\n\n\nYou've never said it outright, but there is something about this place. Not just that it is your getaway, you favorite place in the world. Theres something else... Something you can't explain. It feels even more so today in particular.\n\n\nYou brush off this strong sensation and sit on your blanket. You are excited to dive into your book.

The grass tickles your feet and you realize you are barefoot. As you reach the end of the woods you see a small sleek red fox and a gentle spotted fawn. They stand a fair distance from each other, as if repelled by one another's presence. Their eyes, both pairs staring at you intently, seem to hold more than a regular animals. The fox and the fawn seem strange to you, but then again, you don't even know where you are right now. You wonder if you are even still on earth. Suddenly, the fox and the fawn both run in different directions. The fox scurries straight into a dense area of the woods.

It is tough work keeping up with the fox.\n\n\nAfter ages of running, you feel like you cannot run for much longer. You are about to give up and let the fox get away when you see the fox run into a huge hollow tree and disappear. You slow down and catch your breath while inspecting the tree. It has a massive trunk; you could fit a king size bed inside. An archway acts as an opening into the hollow tree. You walk through and find a massive hole in the ground. Great... another hole.

As you pick up speed, your hair is brushed back in the wind. The trip is exhilarating. When you think you could not possibly go deeper underground, you see a light below you. As you zip closer and closer to it, you see that you are quickly approaching the end of the slide and that the fox is waiting for you at the bottom.\n\n\nYou reach the end of the slide and the fox takes off again. You run after it. As you pass through the long tunnel you try to figure out where the light source is coming from, it seems there is something covering the walls of the tunnel that glows brightly, providing a light as bring as if it were a sunny day.

As you regain your bearings you look up and see a man with dark hair and olive skin laughing down at you. He wears a red sleeveless shirt with a mandarin collar and black pants. He gives you his hand to help you up and you take it.\n\n\n\"Where did the fox go?\" you ask.\n\n\nHe only laughs as a response and turns away from you to walk farther down the tunnel.

In the center of the cavern is a huge stone made of the same glowing substance you saw earlier. The massive open space was filled with members of the fox clan, all wearing clothing similar to Tomas'. To the left you see what look like boxing rings with many people fighting in them. Next to the rings, on the wall, is an impressive display of daggers. To the right is a recessed wall that is filled top to bottom with books. The cavern is breathtaking. As a book lover, the massive library was a welcome sight. However, you are not too sure about the daggers and the boxing rings.\n\n\n\"This way.\" Tomas says.\n\n\nYou both walk around the massive glowing stone. On the other side is a tunnel that is much bigger than the others. A fox face is carved into the stone above the tunnel. You follow Tomas inside. You go through a few twists and turns and finally reach a huge pair of wooden doors. Tomas throws them open without any hesitation.\n\n\n\"Kitsune! We have a visitor!\"\n\n\nYou walk into a room littered with books. Sitting atop a raised area was a man lounging on a massive couch piled with fur. He jumps up at the word 'visitor.' He has blonde hair and is wearing what looks like a crown of twigs woven together, with pieces of glowing rock stuck haphazardly inside. His blue eyes light up when he looks at you.\n\n\n\"Well hello small fox. I see you have chosen our path. A very wise decision, if you ask me.\"\n\n\nHe walks down and off the raised platform and walks over to you. He lifts your hair off your shoulder and observes it.

You do not like being stared at so intently.\n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" You say to him, slightly irritated.\n\n\n\"Feisty!\" he says. \"I like you already.\"\n\n\nHe climbs back up onto his couch.

They were like brothers; inseparable.\n\n\nOne day, as Yohan and Ari were running through the woods, both in animal form, they happened upon a grotto. It was a beautiful oasis which they had never seen before. That was not what held their attention though. A young woman was washing her hair in the clear water of the oasis, humming a tune to herself. She was the most beautiful woman either of them had ever laid their eyes on. The fell in love with her immediately.\n\n\nThe woman's name was Darling. And while she looked like an angel, she was far from it. When she learned that both Yohan and Ari were in love with her, she told them they must fight each other to the death for her love. Ari and Yohan were so in love that they agreed. They met at the ruins, which back then was a beautiful courtyard. They both drew swords, and began to duel. They fought for ten days and ten nights, neither able to get their advantage on their opponent. The entire time Darling watched, enjoying their battle immensely.\n\n\nAfter many days and nights of battle Ari and Yohan finally came to a draw. Yohan's sword was against Ari's neck and vice versa.

You and Kitsune are confused as to what is going on. \n\n\nTomas runs up to you and Kitsune and begins to speak rapidly. He tells you that there has been a collapse in one of the tunnels and that it seems the fawn clan is responsible. There were quite a few people in the tunnel at the time and they are searching for survivors in the rubble right now.\n\n\nYou are shocked at this and cant even form a reaction. Luckily you don't have to because Kitsune steps onto a table and tries to get everyone's attention. Once everyone settles down he begins to speak.\n\n\n\"Everyone please remain calm.

Please everyone remain calm and don't do anything drastic.

They were like brothers; inseparable.\n\n\nOne day, as Yohan and Ari were running through the woods, both in animal form, they happened upon a grotto. It was a beautiful oasis which they had never seen before. That was not what held their attention though. A young woman was washing her hair in the clear water of the oasis, humming a tune to herself. She was the most beautiful woman either of them had ever laid their eyes on.

Ari and Yohan were upset that Darling was ignoring them and they began to blame each other for her distance. The became so enraged with each other, they decided to duel to the death for Darling's love.\n\n\nThey met at the ruins, which back then was a beautiful courtyard. The both drew swords and began to duel. They fought for ten days and ten nights, neither able to get their advantage on their opponent. The entire time Darling had no idea what Yohan and Ari were up to.\n\n\nAfter many days and nights of battle Ari and Yohan finally came to a draw. Yohan's sword was against Ari's neck and vice versa. They held their draw for another ten days and ten nights when finally Ari lowered his sword and said, \"Yohan, I cannot kill you my brother. But because I cannot kill you, Darling can never be mine, and so I will hate you until the end of time.\" \n\n\nThen, Yohan also lowered his sword. \"You are my brother too, Ari, but I will too hate you until the end of time because your life is what has come between me and my true love Darling.\" Darling witnessed this conversation and her heart broke for the loss of their brotherhood.\n\n\nThey both turned away from each other and walked away from the courtyard. Darling was heavy with sadness for these events. She went home to her grotto, and lied in the grass by the waters edge. Darling died of a broken heart, and today, in the spot where died, is a temple dedicated to her.

You find the section about foxes and the section about fawns.\n\n\nThe Fox: The fox has always been associated with intelligence. Foxes are considered very clever animals. They can outwit most things and are prone to taking advantage of that fact. The fox is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence, however they often act like cunning, strategic, quick-thinking tricksters. Foxes are tricky animals and are very good at manipulating a situation. The fox is a beautiful and impressive animal.\n\n\nThe Fawn: The fawn is a baby deer. It is a graceful and swift animal. The fawn is a strong yet delicate creature. It represents peace, innocence, spirituality, and grace. The fawn is an elegant and lovely creature. Many consider it a weak animal, but it is strong in its own unique way. It is fast and moves incredibly swiftly, and has a fierce determination. The fawn can sometimes be stubborn because it is strong in it's beliefs.\n\n\nYou find this all very fascinating, but you only read these two sections before curiosity takes over.
