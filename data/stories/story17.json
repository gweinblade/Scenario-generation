The Adventurer is a tough little ship and veteran of several battles, large enough to hold a Crew of 30 Sailors and 30 days worth of Supplies for them. Although you are only twenty-one years old you have already received the rank of Commodore from your Queen in recognition of your superb ability and seamanship.\n\n\nThe World of Magellan on which you live is mostly ocean occupied by a scattering of islands: twenty-five have already been discovered and there are almost certainly many more waiting out there. The people of your homeland, the Kingdom of the Three Islands, have a rich naval tradition and are technologically advanced: the Adventurer carries four cannons and all of your crew are armed with muskets, though these are slow to load making the sword your secondary weapon. A dozen Colonies have been established beyond the Great Reef which rings your three home islands but these range from thriving settlements to tiny outposts of civilization.\n\n\nYour biggest problem on long voyages is that your ship can only carry enough Supplies for 30 days which will make finding and obtaining fresh sources of Supplies your top priority. If you ever run out of Supplies (your Supply number falls to 0) then you and your Crew will starve to death and die. You will almost certainly lose Crew members during your voyage and you must be careful that your Crew number never falls to 0 either: that will mean that you and all your Crew are dead.\n\n\nFrequently there is a time element involved during your voyages and you will want to complete them in the smallest number of Days possible. Successfully completing a Voyage ahead of your Competitors will result in a Score Point which will show if you leave a Comment after the game that you have completed this story with a very high degree of skill. As in previous adventures you will find it useful to make a map of the waters you sail as you may return this way again and the information may benefit you...\n\n\nSo good luck reader, make wise and strategically sound choices and with a little luck, a good course and a fair wind you might live to see your homeland again!", "action_results": [{"action": "Click here to begin your adventure (remember to pick up the List of Noted Sailors first)", "result": "You stand in the familiar anteroom of the Royal Palace in Golden Sands, the Capital of The Three Islands, your homeland. Either side of you stand your fellow officers Naomi Swift and Eva Freer, both as experienced on the high seas as you are yourself. Pale and slender with long fair hair Naomi's delicate appearance hides a spirit of iron and determination. Eva on the other hand looks every bit as tough as she is with tomboyish short purple-black hair from beneath which her eyes seem to glare in a challenging way at everything she sees. They are your two best friends for different reasons: for Eva you feel something approaching devotion while at the same time awkwardly aware you inspire similar feelings in Naomi.\n\n\nThe Throne Room's doors open and Richard Quarrel, a slimy snake of a man whose marriage to your Queen has done little to improve his popularity with anyone, smiles at you all.\n\n\n\"The Queen will see you now,\" he announces.\n\n\nGoing inside you find more familiar faces waiting for you. Queen Anne-Marie, cold and imperious sits on her Throne while at her side sits the young foreigner Prince Al-Balu who as always looks completely baffled by what is going on around him. On his other side sits Ann Lovett, his fair-haired interpreter who gives you all a quick smile as you enter. On Anne-Marie's other side is a lady you don't recognize, an attractive dark-haired woman with a mocking smile that gives off the disconcerting impression that she knows something the rest of you don't. As you halt Anne-Marie speaks.\n\n\n\"I have summoned you three here because I have need of your services once more,\" she declares. \"I know recently you have been extremely loud in voicing your criticisms of my rule. I also cannot forget that at the moment the Lapau War was approaching it's climactic battle you all rebelled and refused to follow my orders... However in my great and gracious mercy I will forgive you three as I have a task for you to perform. As you are aware neither Commodore Cuthrew or Finch have returned from their voyage of exploration beyond the Western Passage and it has been nearly three months since they left. Obviously the disapearrences of such experienced officers is troubling to say the least... Commodore Trapa. I want you to lead an expedition to find our lost countrymen and see what has befallen them. This is a difficult challenge but it's success will only increase your already great reputation and lead to generous rewards.\"\n\n\nAnne-Marie flickers her eyes over your companions and her expressions darkens as she meets Eva's defiant stare. \"Commodores Freer and Swift will accompany you with their own vessels and will be under your command, you may consider Commodore Swift your deputy.

If you didn't know better you could be sure she is trying to tell you something... you cast your gaze across to Quarrel, who is also smiling at you in a way you don't like, and onto Al-Balu and Lovett who are politely listening to Anne-Marie speak and are not looking at you. Anne-Marie is watching you intently and you promise her you will do all you can to find the missing sailors.\n\n\n\"Oh Commodore Trapa,\" Anne-Marie says as you turn to leave and you glance back. \"I expect you to return with Commodores Cuthrew and Finch or not at all.

There is no sign of Finch's ship, the Royal Escort.\n\n\nEntering the harbor cautiously you, Eva and Naomi all anchor your ships alongside the quay and leading your sailors ashore armed and ready you meet with these people. The crowd draws back as you approach but three tall and strong-looking men who are so alike they can only be brothers stride forward to meet you. Their leader is a handsome man with flowing black hair bound in ringlets and a jovial air. \"Hello, hello,\" he cries out taking your hand and pumping it in a massive fist. He speaks your own language with a strange accent.\n\n\n\"My name is Shingen and I am King of the Elixi Nation! This is our Capital Island which we call Revel. These are my brothers, Kenshin and Ieyasu.\" Kenshin is a broad man who smells strongly of alcohol as he shakes your hand with a yellow-toothed grin. Ieyasu looks the youngest and is also the slimmest, dressed simply in black. He doesn't smile at you as you shake hands but instead surveys you with narrow snake-like eyes.\n\n\n\"As you can see we have already been visited by your countrymen,\" Shingen goes on, gesturing at the Sea Ghost. \"Hence how we know your language. Your great Captains Thomas Finch and Tobias Cuthrew landed here some months ago. I am afraid I have sad news for you. Your great sailor Tobias Cuthrew was very ill when he landed and his sickness grew worse. I am sorry to say he has since died and is buried here in our town's cemetery. After his death his companion Captain Finch sailed away. That was two months ago and we have not heard news of him since.\"\n\n\nYou, Eva and Naomi exchange horrified glances. The news that the greatest sailor of your kingdom is dead shakes you all to the core.\n\n\n\"What about Cuthrew's crew?\" Eva demands. \"What became of them?\"\n\n\n\"Many of them went on with Commodore Finch,\" Shingen says cheerfully. \"Many still reside in this town and have become good friends of my people. For some reason none felt an urge to return to the kingdom ruled by your Queen Anne-Marie... now I have an interest in forming an alliance with your Queen so me and my people will give you all the assistance you require. I assume you intend to journey on to find your missing comrade Finch? If you return here tomorrow I will arrange for enough Supplies to re-provision your ships to be assembled on the quay and we will also provide you with a map of our islands to help you safely navigate them.\"\n\n\n\"We must also visit Commodore Cuthrew's grave,\" you tell King Shingen who nods sympathetically.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow, tomorrow,\" he tells you. \"Return tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\nYou, Eva and Naomi return aboard the Adventurer where you hastily confer. Eva is suspicious.\n\n\n\"I saw Cuthrew before he left on his voyage,\" she tells you both. \"He was ill but he wasn't that ill. I don't trust any of those three.\"\n\n\n\"If we sail away they'll be after us in the Sea Ghost and those other little ships in the harbor,\" Naomi points out. \"I think for the time being it's better that we work with these people.

As before there is an expectant crowd waiting for you but the crowd is oddly silent today and looks tense. Glancing round them you notice something strange: there is a ship approaching the island rapidly from the South. Squinting at it you recognize it with a start: it is Thomas Finch's Royal Escort! Eva and Naomi recognize it too and freeze halfway down the quay, your sailors all stop behind you as well. Eva grips your arm, sending a thrill of excitement through you.\n\n\n\"I don't like this,\" she says quietly and for the first time in all the time you have known her she sounds scared.\n\n\nThe crowd parts in Shingen, Kenshin and Ieyasu come striding towards you. Unlike yesterday they are armed: Shingen and Kenshin are carrying drawn swords in their hands while Ieyasu is holding an extremely short-barreled musket which is more like a pistol. As they advance within a few feet of you the crowd behind them edges forward and more weapons appear. With a feeling of horror you realize that you have led your whole expedition into a trap.\n\n\n\"Eva! Naomi! Get back!\" you shout.\n\n\nShingen lunges towards you with his sword but you spring back just in time, drawing your own sword as you do. At the same moment Kenshin gives a mighty sweep of his sword that cuts through both of Naomi Swift's eyes, with a scream she clutches her bleeding face. Ieyasu steps forward, cocks his pistol with a click, raises it and shoots Eva point blank in the chest. She is thrown backwards, landing on her back on the jetty where she lies staring open-eyed at the sky, her face still wearing a last expression of surprise.\n\n\nWith a roar of rage you slash your sword wildly at Shingen, forcing him back. Steel grates as swords clang against each other and muskets bang on both sides. A musket ball whistles past your head and as Shingen retreats you grab the blinded Naomi wand holding her body close to yours with your free arm you drag her back to safety. Your ninety sailors are trapped at the end of the quay facing a crowd several times their own number and death seems inevitable.\n\n\nYour countrymen sell their lives dearly. While you drag Naomi back across the gangplank leading to the Adventurer, musket balls flying so thickly all about you that it seems a miracle you are not hit, your sailors fight the crowd on the quay. They are cut down and butchered mercilessly, a few dozen manage to flee across the gangplank to the Adventurer but most are cut down. You manage to get the Adventurer's anchor raised, the sails raised and manage to steer away from the quay, forced to abandon both the Explorer and Esme's Joy, not to mention the bodies of your countrymen including Eva.\n\n\nEven as the Adventurer moves out into the harbor with the surviving sailors from all three ships on board, about thirty altogether while twice that amount lie dead on Revel's jetties, the Sea Ghost explodes into life, firing a row of six cannons. One of the shot decapitates two of your sailors and another hits a third sailor plumb in the chest, blasting him into several pieces. Gathering speed the Sea Ghost moves forward to cut off your escape.\n\n\nHelp is finally at hand however. The approaching Royal Escort fires two cannons and a volley of musket shots, forcing the Sea Ghost to veer away. This gives you a chance to slip the Adventurer out of the harbor and you sail straight towards the Royal Escort, unaware of who is in command but only knowing that they are on your side. As the Royal Escort turns back towards the South you follow her, putting as much space between you and the murderous tyrants of Revel as possible.", "action_results": [{"action": "Shock", "result": "Eva Freer is dead. It seems impossible but it is true.\n\n\nNaomi Swift has been blinded and will never see again. You carry her into your cabin where your ship's surgeon attends to her injuries night and day. So many have died: altogether you have lost more than sixty sailors and two of your expedition's ships: only the Adventurer and her small Crew remains. For three days you follow the Royal Escort, unaware of where you are going and not particularly caring until you come to a small rocky island. Seven ships, similar in size to the Adventurer but of a different design are anchored offshore. Sailing in among them you meet your new allies.\n\n\nSeven Elixi Captains come aboard the Adventurer. Their leader is Azai, a grey-bearded old man with a permanently worried look who you may have met before. His six companions are Amako, a tall and cold-natured man who stands in sharp contrast to his brother Ryuzoji, a young cheerful man dressed in clothes of bright red. Miura is a big man with a long flowing black beard while his brother Rokkaku is a bit of a dandy, elegantly dressed in fine clothes. Sanada is a tall and handsome man while his companion Sogo has dark skin and unlike the others drinks tea in your cabin while the others accept wine from you. You find all their names a little difficult to remember and in your depressed state can't raise the interest to care much about any of them. Your thoughts are dwelling on Eva and you are only half-listening as Azai talks.\n\n\n\"You are not the first to come to our land, the first visitors were two of your Captains called Finch and Quarrel who came to Revel from the west some six months ago,\" Azau tells you. \"Later a woman called Sapphira Dancer also visited from the west. This was when Renewel was still Queen and kept her evil sons Shingen, Kenshin and Ieyasu in check. A few months after Dancer came four more ships, this time from the east. Dancer, Quarrel, Finch and Tobias Cuthrew were their four Captains.\"\n\n\n\"They stayed at Revel for several weeks. By day your countrymen spoke to Queen Renewel but by night they plotted with Shingen and his brothers in the darkness. One night there was a bloody coup: Shingen cut his mother's throat while she slept and his supporters took control of the Palace. During the coup Cuthrew and Finch tried to intervene on the Queen's side. Cuthrew was shot and killed in the fighting while Finch was stabbed through the chest. He and a few of his sailors managed to get back to their ship and escape.\"\n\n\n\"Me and my six fellow Captains are loyal supporters of Queen Renewel. When Shingen took power and named himself King we fled here with our ships and Commodore Finch. We did our best to help him but Finch's wound was mortal. Knowing he was dying he told us the names of you and your companions as people who could be trusted. After he died we buried him at sea. Since then we have been patrolling the waters between the Western Passage and Revel in hope of meeting you. I saw your ship a week ago and rushed here to alert the other Captains. We sent Finch's remaining Crew aboard the Royal Escort to Revel to meet you. We guessed you would not trust us but you would not doubt the word of your own countrymen... we never expected Shingen would try to murder you all before we could get there. According to Finch, Quarrel and Dancer told him Shingen and Anne-Marie have formed an alliance and together they would kill all who criticized or spoke out against their tyrranical rule...\"\n\n\n\"We are grateful for your help,\" you say wearily and lying in her sickbed in your cabin Naomi nods sightlessly. \"But what can we do now? Eva is dead. Naomi cannot see. We have lost the Explorer and Esme's Joy and most of our Crews. You have seven ships and a few hundred sailors here but there are thousands of armed men in Revel and many more in Golden Sands under Anne-Marie's control... what can we do?\" you stare at the table while the Elixi Captains glance among themselves.\n\n\n\"We have an idea,\" Azai says finally.", "action_results": [{"action": "A slim chance", "result": "\"There appear to be three great nations on this world your people call Magellan,\" Azai tells you. \"There are my people, the Elixi, there are your people who we call the Navar, the Barrier Folk and there are also the Lapau, the spear-armed canoe-warriors who we have learned your people fought a War against. We know that Anne-Marie and Shingen have formed an alliance. Finch told us that Quarrel had claimed to him that the purpose of this alliance was to attack the Lapau on two fronts and crush them as your people failed to do alone. The slaughtered Lapau's lands would be divided between Anne-Marie and Shingen. Me and my companions believe the Lapau are our only possible allies.\"\n\n\n\"King Al-Capu agreed to a peace treaty with Queen Anne-Marie,\" you tell Azai. \"His son is a hostage in Queen Anne-Marie's court. Even if we sail to Matan and even if he believes us, which is unlikely, what can the Lapau do against the combined navies of my people and yours? The Navar as you call us nearly destroyed the Lapau in our War with them, they certainly don't have a chance against both the Navar and Elixi.\" \n\n\n\"We must try,\" Azai insists. \"With your people the Navar and my people the Elixi deceived into this evil alliance by their rulers the Lapau are our only chance for help.\"\n\n\n\"Matan is on the other side of the world,\" you remind Azai. \"To get there we either have to sail through territory ruled by Queen Anne-Marie or territory ruled by your Shingen or through completely uncharted waters. Shingen now has the Sea Ghost, Explorer and Esme's Joy. I am pretty sure that he and his brothers will come after us with everything they've got. You've got a strong little navy here but I don't think it will be a match for the full might of Anne-Marie and Shingen.\n\n\n\"We have thought of that,\" Azai tells you. \"We will all sail to Matan in four different directions. I will go Northeast, skirting the Great Reef and traveling through your kingdom's colonies to reach Matan. Amako and Ryuzoji will sail Southeast, skirting the Great Reef and also pass through your kingdom's colonies to Matan. Miura and Rokkaku will sail Southwest through uncharted waters to Matan and finally Sanada and Sogo will sail Northwest through the islands of the Elixi to Matan. You must choose which of us you think has the best chance of getting through.\"\n\n\nYour mind is still full of memories of Eva's expression of surprise when she was killed. With a deep sigh you cross to where Naomi is lying in her sickbed with a bloodied bandage over her eyes and take her hand in yours.

Altogether this eleven-ship fleet is even larger than the War Fleet you sailed with during the Lapau War and it clearly means business. Anne-Marie promptly sends Al-Balu into Matan to invite you and King Al-Capu to a meeting aboard the Matan Afloat that evening.\n\n\nHistory will remember it as The Conference of the Captains.\n\n\nFourteen of you attend the Conference. Escorting the blinded Naomi and the frowning King Al-Capu and protected by numerous royal bodyguards you are rowed out to the Matan Afloat. Waiting for you are Anne-Marie, looking as regal and haughty as ever, the young Prince Al-Balu and his advisor Ann Lovett, Anne-Marie's lackeys Richard Quarrel and Saphia Dancer (the latter grinning broadly at the sight of you), Shingen, Ieyasu and Kenshin standing together and with their hands tied behind them by rope are Amako, Ryuzoji and Rokkaku, the last of the loyal Elixi Captains and prisoners of your enemies. You soon learn the other four are dead: Azai was lost in a storm and Miura, Sanada and Sogo were all killed by either Shingen, Kenshin or Ieyasu. King Al-Capu begins the conference.\n\n\n\"I am puzzled by the words of your Captains Queen,\" he tells Anne-Marie. \"They tell me an amazing story about the Navar and the Elixi conspiring together to murder those Captains who oppose your rule. Surely this cannot be true?\"\n\n\n\"It seems that a mistake has occurred,\" Anne-Marie says calmly surveying you and Naomi. \"It seems that there has been a plot by one close to me to murder those Captains who oppose my rule and this Captain has been asking King Shingen and his brothers to help him kill these Captains claiming it was my wish. This plot has now been uncovered and the man behind it will be punished.\"\n\n\nDrawing a pistol from within her pocket, Anne-Marie turns sideways, points the barrel directly at the side of her husband Richard Quarrel's head and calmly pulls the trigger. Brain matter and skull shards spray over Saphia Dancer, who has finally lost her calm composure and looks deeply shaken. Still wearing a look of astonishment Quarrel topples to the deck and lies there in a pool of blood until at Anne-Marie's order two sailors pick up his body and throw it into the sea. All the Captains at the meeting, including you, look absolutely stunned by this sudden cold-blooded murder except Anne-Marie who continues speaking calmly.\n\n\n\"It seems that after the unfortunate and accidental deaths of Tobias Cuthrew and Thomas Finch during the succession of King Shingen my late husband conceived an idea to kill Leo Trapa, Eva Freer and Naomi Swift and sent orders in my name to King Shingen to have them murdered. Fortunately this plot was only partially successful but it has cost me the valued services of two of my best Captains... I have spoken with King Shingen and he and his brothers are all extremely sorry for their role in this tragic affair.\"\n\n\n\"That is true,\" Shingen says cheerfully and looks at you. \"Commodore Trapa, Commodore Swift, I am extremely sorry for the unfortunate injuries that have befallen you and for the death of your companion Eva Freer. As a way of showing how repentant the whole Elixi nation is I have signed an Alliance with Queen Anne-Marie and opened all our ports and harbors to Navar ships and traders. We had something of a premonition of the Queen's husband's unfortunate death and last night I pledged that if anything were to happen to Quarrel I would like to offer my hand to her in marriage as a way of forming a true and lasting alliance between our two great countries. I am happy to say she has accepted.\"\n\n\nEvents are moving incredibly fast and you are finding it difficult to follow everything that is happening.\n\n\n\"What about the murders of the Elixi Captains by Shingen and his brothers?\" you demand indicating the bound prisoners. \"What about me and my men being hunted all across the sea?\"\n\n\n\"That was another unfortunate misunderstanding,\" Shingen says smoothly. \"I wrongly believed Queen Anne-Marie wanted you dead which is why my brothers and I have been hunting you. These Elixi Captains are a different story... these men are pirates who stole ships from my navy and pillaged my towns and ships. There can only be one punishment for piracy.\"\n\n\nAmako, Ryuzoji and Rokkaku are led to the side of the ship by three sailors who raise their muskets and shoot each of them in the back of the head. One by one the bodies are dropped into the sea and you turn away feeling sick by the sight of your allies being ruthlessly killed. The murders have cast something of a pall over the Conference but Anne-Marie claps her hands together and suddenly becomes extremely business-like.\n\n\n\"Well now that is all cleared up and the guilty parties punished,\" Anne-Marie says happily. \"Leo, Naomi, in recognition of your terrible trials I am immediately promoting both of you to the ranks of Vice Admiral in my Navy, I am also similarly conferring promotions on all those present here. We will all return to Golden Sands together as in the future I will have need of your considerable skills. King Al-Capu, I am sorry for the inconvenience you have been put to and I am happy to return your son and advisor to you. If you would be so kind we would like to buy some supplies from you before beginning our journey back to our homelands. King Shingen and I have a wedding to organize in Golden Sands and we would like both you Leo and you Naomi to attend.\"\n\n\n\"No,\" Naomi says flatly. There is a moment's silence.\n\n\n\"No,\" Anne-Marie asks in a dangerous tone, glaring at her blinded subordinate.\n\n\n\"No,\" Naomi repeats. \"Everyone here present knows it was you and not Quarrel who ordered the deaths of Cuthrew, Finch and Freer and tried to have me and Leo killed. You killed Quarrel to silence him. You King Shingen, together with your brothers, killed your mother Renewel and those seven Captains who were loyal to her memory. All of you have blood on your hands. Once you have us in your power you will kill us as well. With your alliance you will destroy the Lapau and divide the world of Magellan between yourselves. When there is no one else left to fight you will fight each other, do you really expect to last longer than the Queen's last three husbands King Shingen? No ones lives are safe as long as this woman remains Queen.\"\n\n\nAnne-Marie looks white and livid with rage. As she stands there before you in her expensive clothes with narrow snakelike eyes glaring out from a pale face you feel nothing but revulsion towards her. Finally King Al-Capu speaks.\n\n\n\"I have heard all the words that I need to,\" he declares. \"Chief Anne-Marie, Chief Shingen, you will take your ships and your people from my lands at once and I do not want you to return. The warriors Leo Trapa and Naomi Swift shall stay here, I do not think they will live one day more under your rule.\"\n\n\nAnne-Marie's features compose themselves into a cold and terrible smile.\n\n\n\"Good then,\" she says. \"If there will be War I would rather it was now than later. Last time I was here I allowed myself to be tricked into peace by my Captains. This time we will decide the fate of the Lapau people with one great battle. In one hour we will be in a War that can only end with the complete subjugation of the Lapau people. Trapa, Swift, the next time we meet you will die.\"\n\n\nAnne-Marie, Saphia Dancer, Shingen, Ieyasu and Kenshin all leave the ship with their sailors in longboats and return to their own vessels to get ready to attack.

The slaughter is terrible.\n\n\nYou will never forget the sights of the Battle: of the clouds of cannon smoke rising up from the gigantic Monarch of the Sea, the endless crackle of musket fire as your sailors line the rails of the Adventurer to fire at your enemies and of the sight and sound of hundreds of men shooting, spearing, screaming and dying in the blood-soaked waters. One sight in particular will always stay with you: Naomi standing proud and tall near the mast of the Adventurer shouting orders and encouragement to the gunners while cannonballs and musket balls whistle all about her. You never loved and respected her more than you do this day.\n\n\nThere are some successes. The Warrior, Royal Avenger and Charmer are all overrun by Lapau Warriors and sunk. The high point of the Battle for your side comes when you and the Grand Alliance fire simultaneous volleys into the leaderless Indefatigable which promptly explodes into thousands of shards of wood and metal, raining debris down on the entire battlefield. Unfortunately things only get worse after that.\n\n\nArmed with muskets, numerous cannons and hundreds of sailors the ships of Anne-Marie's Fleet easily outmatch the Lapau fighting in the water. By the end of the day the sea is a rising and falling carpet of corpses as the best part of Lapau's warriors lie dead upon those waves. That night Matan is evacuated and Anne-Marie's sailors occupy it, killing any who remain behind whether they be man, woman or child, young or old. The Capital of the great Lapau Nation is burnt to the ground, every last hut and tree consumed by ravenous fire until all that is left is a great mound of ash.\n\n\nMatan is no more.\n\n\nAs the flames lick higher and consume the island you guide the battered but undaunted Adventurer away followed by the Grand Alliance and Matan Afloat. Only a few hundred Lapau warriors have survived the carnage, you can hear Al-Capu screaming in pain and sadness aboard the Matan Afloat. Leaving your victorious enemies behind you steer into the night, no particular destination in mind and no hope in this darkest of nights.\n\n\nYou go down to your cabin and there you find Naomi is already waiting for you, sitting on the edge of her bed with her head in her hands. You sit next to her, take her hand in yours and for a moment the two of you just sit there in silence, each lost in your own thoughts. Finally Naomi speaks.\n\n\n\"This is the beginning of a new kind of war,\" she tells you. \"There must be people, Elixi and Navar, who will not stand for the blood lust of their tyrants. They must know if the Lapau are destroyed then there will be no end to Anne-Marie and Shingen's dark reigns. We must have the support of the people if we have any chance of overthrowing Anne-Marie and Shingen.\"\n\n\n\"We need to kill Anne-Marie,\" you tell Naomi grimly, memories of Eva's dead face and the day's massacre fresh in your mind. \"We need to kill Anne-Marie and Shingen both. For Eva.\"\n\n\nNaomi turns to face you and rubs at her shattered eyes beneath the bandage.\n\n\n\"I know I can never be Eva Freer but I hope that in time our friendship will strengthen and you will come to care for me the way I care for you Leo.

I used this idea in my first story The Lost Expedition but I found land-based adventures a bit boring and also an over-saturated genre (like Lord of the Rings...). Sea adventures are much more rare and I've enjoyed writing them more than the Land ones.\n\n\nPart of my research for Sea stories involved reading about some of the epic voyages of naval history and out of all of them Ferdinand Magellan's first Circumnavigation of the World seems the most remarkable (the Mutiny on the Bounty is another fascinating story I hope to turn into a story-game sometime but there is already one of those on this site) hence why my fictional world is called Magellan. I wondered what it would have been like if Magellan was racing against other Captains and that is where the idea for Magellan 1 Race into the Great Unknown comes from.\n\n\nFor Magellan 2 I wanted to move into darker territory and used the American and European conquests and slaughter of native populations as a starting point. The Lapau War is based roughly on the Pacific Theatre of World War 2 (did anybody notice how the big surprise Lapau attack on the War Fleet while it rests at anchor is a lot like Pearl Harbor?) and reveals Anne-Marie's almost Hitler-like mentality of might makes right and how she feels it is almost her duty to take from weaker nations to make her own country stronger.\n\n\nIf the Navar are American/European and the Lapau are Natives then the Elixi can be likened to Chinese or Asians. Shingen, Ieyasu and Kenshin all get their names from famous 16th century Japanese War Lords while Azai, Rokkaku, Miura, Ryuzoji, Sogo, Sanada and Amako are all Japanese Clans. I've specifically avoided mention of skin color altogether and hopefully used the characters' names to make them representative of their cultures.\n\n\nThough they are named after Japanese Clans the adventures and fates of Azai et al are loosely based on famous pirates from the Golden Age of Piracy: Azai is based on Benjamin Hornigold, Amako on Charles Vane, Ryuzoji on Calico Jack Rackham, Miura on Blackbeard, Rokkaku on Stede Bonnet, Sanada on Howell Davis and Sogo on Black Bart Roberts. Like their fictional counterparts these pirates had colorful careers and all met rather unpleasant ends but reading about them one gets the impression they accepted early deaths as something that came with the job of being a pirate. Bart Roberts, the most successful of the bunch, even had the phrase \"a short but merry life\" as his motto.\n\n\nSo what awaits Leo and Naomi in Magellan 4: Search for Original Ideas and the conclusion of the series, Magellan 5? I don't want to give away plot ideas except to mention I have been reading a lot about Sir Francis Drake recently and also thinking about how the idea of Turtle Ships / Ironclads could give the unfortunate allies a much-needed advantage in their battle against Anne-Marie and her blood-thirsty henchmen...\n\n\nAnyway, as always thanks for taking the time to read my story and especially for taking the time to read this.
