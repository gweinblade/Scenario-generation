The lone candle in the center offers little light, but Samuel is used to reading in such circumstances. The mug of mead helps with eye-strain, at least that\u2019s what he told himself. Earlier in life Samuel might have complained at the project in front of him, but with age comes a sense of responsibility along with a greater appreciation for tasks that didn\u2019t stress his aching joints.\n\nBrother Samuel lifts the mug to his mouth only to discover the contents empty.\n\n\u201cBah, one of these days I\u2019m going to get a bigger cup,\u201d he mutters to himself and rises from his seat.\n\nAs he moves, his plain robe sways in the air as if drapes hung over an open window. With one hand around the mug, and the other grasping his walking cane, he exits the monestary\u2019s library. The simple gray stones lining the hallway appear black, except for the small area around the lit torches, not that Brother Samuel required sight to navigate his way around. The silence of the night is disturbed by the steady tap, tap, tap of his wooden cane on the stone floor.\n\nSamuel enters the kitchen to discover it\u2019s not empty. A young girl with bright blonde hair is on the floor with a bucket and rag. She scrubs at the floor, purposefully, ensuring every inch of the floor is spotless.\n\n\u201cChild, what are you doing? It\u2019s the middle of the night,\u201d Samuel asks.\n\n\u201cBrother Trevor said I need to scrub every inch of the kitchen to atone,\u201d she answers.\n\n\u201cBrother Trevor can lick a slug. Children need their sleep,\u201d Samuel replies.\n\nShe girl laughs. \u201cEw!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you atoning for?\u201d\n\n\u201cComplaining.\u201d\n\nBrother Samuel begins to answer when he hears a noise from outside. Was it from within the monastery walls? No, the sudden crash wasn\u2019t muffled or distorted at all. It had to have originated in the open air. The girl hasn\u2019t returned to scrubbing, which means she heard it too; it wasn\u2019t just the mead.\n\n\u201cGo back to bed, girl. I\u2019ll handle Brother Trevor in the morning,\u201d Samuel quietly speaks.\n\nShe nods and leaves the kitchen. Brother Samuel places his empty mug on the counter and heads to the outside door. This time, he walks upright without the use of the cane. The open night air stings Brother Samuel\u2019s wrinkled skin. The full moon illuminates the surrounding grassy hilltops. Trees sprinkled on the slopes cast dark shadows, creating pockets of darkness. No bandit had come close to the monastery in years. Even criminals were smart enough to keep their distance. If they weren\u2019t, they learned quickly. Subtle movement on the hill catches his eye. The night air suddenly felt much colder.\n\nDrawing on a lifetime of training as well as several cups of mead, Brother Samuel calmly walks towards the movement. Nearing the origin of the movement, Samuel suddenly feels the presence of someone, or something. Then he sees it. A boy lies collapsed in the grass. His clothes are tattered and several deep scratches line his arms and legs. His skin appears dark, although closer observation reveals it to be dirt.\n\nBrother Samuel approaches the boy to check for signs of vitality. His fingers check for a pulse. It\u2019s there, but barely. As Samuel leans to pick the boy up, a chill runs down his spine. He feels another\u2019s presence. Samuel slowly brings his gaze up in front of him. A figure, masked in shadowy wisps, stands unmoving before him. Two crimson eyes peer through the darkness directly on Samuel.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll not harm the boy, shade,\u201d Brother Samuel speaks. He activates the divine magic seals on his cane for emphasis. The wood begins to emit holy light infusing its strength through Brother Samuel\u2019s body.\n\nThe shade doesn\u2019t react. Then Samuel begins to hear a slow, resonating laugh. The laughter isn\u2019t audible, it feels as if it originates and echoes within Samuel\u2019s head. In a swirl of black mist, the shade vanishes into the night. The mocking laugh begins to slowly subside within Samuel\u2019s head. Samuel scoops his arms under the unconscious boy and lifts him from the ground.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe now, child,\u201d he whispers to you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Chapter 1: Childhood", "result": "When I reflect upon my childhood, mixed emotions rise. On one hand, I appreciate the strict devotion of the monks. They knew who they were, which is more than could be said for the average person. On the other hand, a sinister, underlying ideology tainted their religion; the monks would only accept infants without any worldly or familial experience.\n\nI imagined my arrival to the monastery to be a result of loving parents wanting a better life for me. It was a good lie to believe at a young age. The monks accepted me, even though I was much older than an infant. That fact alone made me different from my peers and hurled me straight to the bottom of the hierarchy. The lie I told myself about my parents was one of the things that kept me going.\n\nThe monks were zealous in their beliefs, not allowing impurities of the body and mind to affect their training. I\u2019m grateful for the discipline instilled in me at a young age. It made things easier. Not that it was an easy life. Rising before the sun to train, only to spend the daylight hours training even more, wasn\u2019t an easy life. Habits are hard to break and the monks broke all of mine early on.

You could use it.\u201d\n\nUnanswering, you pull yourself up and raise your arms defensively. Still smiling, Kassi lunges forward. You cover your face with your hands and hug your elbows in tight to protect your torso. Still, somehow, her strikes find their mark.

Eventually, her struggling begins to fade.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, child,\u201d Samuel says walking across the mat.\n\nYou release the choke and allow Kassi to sit up, or at least you allow her to. She lies on the mat unmoving.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always been a stubborn one. Devoted, but stubborn,\u201d Brother Samuel comments. He kneels down beside her unconscious body and closes his eyes. After uttering words you cannot comprehend, he places his palm on her forehead. Blue light softly glows from the small crevice between his palm and her head.

Deep down, the shade\u2019s interest in the boy frightened him. He had the feeling it wouldn\u2019t be the last appearance to the boy. The boy\u2019s past is a mystery, and ordinarily he would have been turned away from the monastery. Though he didn\u2019t show it, Brother Samuel could tell the Grandmaster took special interest in the boy as well. Samuel knew the Grandmaster before he earned the title. Only the Master of Archives could share the same boast.\n\nBrother Samuel reaches his destination: the Grandmaster\u2019s private study. The heavy oak door is reinforced with steel, barring unwanted entry. Samuel knows there are other deterrents to keep thieves or renegade monks out. He closes his eyes to focus on the seals. Magic flows from his open palms dispelling the deadly traps. He takes a coin from his pocket and looks at the door\u2019s keyhole. He whispers into the coin, and the object transforms into a key. He unlocks the door and flips the key into the air. After several flips in the air, a coin lands into his open palm.\n\n\u201cStill got it, old man,\u201d he whispers to himself.\n\nThe door swings open revealing a room lined with bookcases.

The wisp, the Master of Archives, shines disapprovingly. Not many would be able to tell an approving shine versus a disapproving one, but Brother Samuel is not unaccustomed to the one before him.\n\n\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Brother Samuel replies.\n\n\u201cWhy not come with the Grandmaster? You are among the few he\u2019s invited in,\u201d the wisp answers.\n\nSamuel hesitates. He knows the wisp will relay his words and actions to the Grandmaster. \u201cI\u2019m searching for a tome on dark magic. Specifically, on the origins of shades. The Grandmaster is far too busy to help me look for a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of history books in the main library.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one is not among them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d\n\nSamuel takes a seat at the center table. He\u2019d been standing too long without his cane. He breathes out an exhausted breath. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve checked. I\u2019ve spent years carefully working through all the volumes we have in the library. It\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, follow me. I shall inform the Grandmaster of your intrusion. No doubt, he will reprimand you for your actions. I am no guardian of knowledge. I exist to further it.\u201d\n\nWhatever punishment the Grandmaster gave, it would be worth it. Brother Samuel rises from his seat and follows the wisp down the hall of books. The white glow from the Master of Archives, in combination with the blue torch light, casts sinister-looking shadows from angles of differently shapen books. The two arrive at a small section of the bookcase wall. The Master of Archives circles in the air for a moment and then flies directly into the wall. The light vanishes instantly, leaving Brother Samuel alone in the blue.\n\nBrother Samuel stands still for a few moments and then begins to feel uneasy. The thought pops into his head that the wisp could have let him into a trap. He checks the hallway for movement. Nothing. Suddenly, the bookcase swings open and Samuel is face to face with the wisp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to open a doorway without arms,\u201d the wisp says.\n\nBrother Samuel frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being funny. Maybe this is a trap,\u201d he comments.\n\nThe Master of Archives ignores him and flies down the dark staircase. Brother Samuel does his best to follow quickly. The narrow staircase leads into an even narrower hallway and finally to an open room. Several single-bodied cells are against the sidewalls. Samuel gulps and tries to ignore them. The wisp leads him through rows of cells before arriving at a series of pedestals, five of them arranged around a summoning circle.\n\n\u201cThe tome is here?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d the wisp replies. \u201cApproach the middle pedestal.\u201d\n\nBrother Samuel does as he\u2019s instructed. On top of the pedestal lies an open scroll. Samuel instantly recognizes the spell\u2019s intent. \u201cBy the light, I\u2019m to call him to this plane?\u201d he wonders aloud.\n\n\u201cSuch knowledge is too dangerous to be written.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd summoning the dead isn\u2019t?\u201d Samuel retorts. \u201cVery well. If this is the only way.\u201d\n\nBrother Samuel silently reads the scroll, softly moving his lips as if pronouncing the words. Satisfied at his ability, he speaks the incantation. Nothing happens and he repeats it again. Still nothing. Finally, he shouts the incantation.\n\nBlack mist begins to swirl at the circle\u2019s center. It begins low and then slowly builds in density and rotation. As quickly as it appeared, the mist dissipates. A lone figure hunches in the summoning circle: Ragar the Unbroken. His skin loosely hangs from his bones, completely absent in many places. The few strands of black hair that haven\u2019t fallen out completely dangle near the edge of his shoulders. The left side of his mouth is completely rotted away.\n\n\u201cWhy have you called me from the abyss?\u201d Ragar snarls.\n\n\u201cI seek knowledge on shades,\u201d Brother Samuel answers. \u201cKnowledge that even the lowliest necromancer would have.\u201d\n\n\u201cShades! Don\u2019t insult me, monk. I have no love for petty sorcerers, but even less for devotees of the light.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will tell me the knowledge I seek,\u201d Samuel commands. He holds out his arm in focus. Blinding light fires from his open palm searing Ragar\u2019s cheek. Ragar grimaces in pain and attempts to resist. The magic seals surrounding the summoning chamber amplifies the divine magic. The ray from Samuel\u2019s palm grows brighter.\n\n\u201cTell me what I seek!\u201d Samuel shouts.\n\nA piercing screech projects from the summoned spirit echoing throughout the room. The intensity grows with the ray\u2019s brightness. Suddenly, the spirit collapses. The screech, now silent, leaves behind a soft ringing in Samuel\u2019s ears.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Ragar the Unbroken utters. \u201cAsk your accursed questions and release me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve crossed paths with a shade and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re lucky to still be alive, monk,\u201d Ragar interrupts.\n\nSamuel warns him with a look and continues. \u201cShades are the spirits of the dead in possession of a living being. Is there a reason a shade would be interested in another being? A boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not uncommon for the spirit to search for a more powerful host. There is a fine line between choosing to possess a strong host, and being destroyed in the attempt. If the spirit grows too ambitious, they may find themselves facing a being too powerful. That\u2019s why shades primarily inhabit sorcerers who overstep in their search for powerful magic.\n\n\u201cI came across a boy being pursued by a shade. I do not understand how the boy resisted its possession.\n\n\u201cAre you sure he resisted?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "\u201cI am sure he resisted the shade,\u201d Brother Samuel says.\n\n\u201cThat is your concern, not mine.

Ragar the Unbroken strides through the magic seals, gazing intently on Samuel. The monk begins to draw on the magic infused in his cane, but Ragar is quicker. Shadow magic fills the air cutting Brother Samuel\u2019s ability to breathe. The magic hangs heavy as if the monk is dragged further and further underwater.\n\nRagar fires a shadow bolt directly at Brother Samuel\u2019s chest. Unable to move in time, Samuel closes his eyes preparing for the end and...nothing. He blinks his eyes open to find a hooded figure beside him.\n\n\u201cFool!\u201d the Grandmaster shouts while maintaining the protective shield around the two. The medallion around his neck emits a bright white light.\n\nRagar the Unbroken fires several more shadow bolts towards the monks. Each is absorbed through into the shield. Brother Samuel sees the Grandmaster\u2019s eyes squint slightly in concentration, then his eyes turn the same pure white emanating from the medallion. The Grandmaster expertly weaves his arms forward. The energy absorbed into the shield begins to redirect into a ball firing straight towards Ragar. The blast explodes into the wall sending chunks of rock to the floor.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ragar the Unbroken is nowhere to be seen.\n\n\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Brother Samuel asks.\n\n\u201cYes, for centuries,\u201d the Grandmaster replies.\n\nBrother Samuel\u2019s gaze meets the Grandmaster\u2019s gray eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had to know,\u201d he breaks the silence.\n\nThe Grandmaster places his hand on Samuel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMy friend, I do not blame you for seeking truth. You were foolish to seek it alone. Come, we will speak on this later. The king\u2019s emissaries will soon be arriving for the Grand Melee.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "The Grand Melee", "result": "The day of the Grand Melee has finally arrived. The weeks since your talk with Kassi has been spent preparing for this day. The event takes place on a nearby mountainside. Halfway up the rocky slope, a section of the mountain jettisons out as if the top portion was cut cleanly off. The result is flat-topped overhang, which overlooks the surrounding hills. Many monks trek to the area for prolonged meditation, but today it was meant for combat.\n\nA lifted stage lies in the center of the plateau. The structure is built to be a little smaller than the practice room mats. The stage stands several feet from the ground and has no railing. In each of the melee\u2019s categories, if you fall, you\u2019re automatically disqualified. You stand next to Kassi in the ready room, although it\u2019s more a roped-off enclosure than room.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that next to the Grandmaster?\u201d you ask her.\n\nNext to the hooded elder stands a man dressed in an armored dark red robe.The crimson robe is reinforced with light plate in several key areas. A sizeable, yet nimble, breastplate is attached to his front and back torso. His shoulders are protected by layered pieces of metal. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any armor from his waist-down, with movement prioritized over raw protection. Two short swords hang on his back. Brother Samuel stands near the two. He notices your stare, and gives a friendly wink.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the king\u2019s emissary,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about the emissary?\u201d\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n\u201cDuring every melee, the King sends a man to scout for warriors. Once a year, one of us is recruited to serve the King.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe taking one of us?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cOf course. The King protects our borders and in return we help protect him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d you comment.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here long. Don\u2019t worry, he only takes the top warrior. You\u2019ll be with us for life,\u201d she answers.\n\nYou reply with a nasty, but playful look.\n\nMovement catches your eye. Your gaze is drawn to center stage where Brother Trevor begins the announcements.\n\n\u201cWelcome brothers. The time of the Grand Melee is upon us. This is a time where we put our disciplined training to the test. Without trial, we cannot fully understand our strength. The good King Aeric has sent his man, Seth, to observe our progress. This is a time where\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFire!\u201d a monk near the plateau\u2019s edge yells.\n\nThe cliff\u2019s edge becomes crowded as the mountain\u2019s inhabitants rush for a viewing spot. From within the monastery's eastern wall, a pillar of smoke rises through the air. Like ants spewing from an anthill, soldiers pour over the surrounding hills charging towards the monastery. Large flaming projectiles fly in the air, their siege constructs hidden by the hills.\n\n\u201cIs this the \u2018protection\u2019 King Aeric offers?\u201d one of the younger members questions.\n\n\u201cQuiet yourself,\u201d the Grandmaster interjects. \u201cWe have not been overrun in a thousand years. I\u2019ll not allow it to happen now.\u201d\n\nThe Grandmaster steps to the very edge of the cliff. The mountain wind carries his robe as if a cape behind him. His arms move through the air as his lips speak the spell into existence. An outline of a door appears just off the cliff\u2019s edge.\n\n\u201cStep through the portal. We must protect our home,\u201d the Grandmaster directs. \u201cLucky for us, King Aeric\u2019s emissary is here to help.\u201d\n\nOne by one, the monks step out over the cliff into the portal. The way their bodies disappear reminds you of dropping a rock into a pond. Seth walks to the portal with his hands on his hips shaking his head. You could imagine his thought: \u201ctoday of all days...\u201d\n\nFinally it gets to your turn. You begin to step forward and feel a hand stop you. You turn to find Brother Samuel.\n\n\u201cThis day has come sooner than I expected, child,\u201d he speaks.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you inquire.\n\n\u201cSince I brought you in, I knew you were not destined to live a solitary life. I never did tell you about the night I found you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nYou see his face darken, even more than the surrounding monks who were off to battle.\n\nHe speaks in a softer tone. \u201cGreat evil follows you. I thought you\u2019d be safe here. I don\u2019t know why it wants you, but it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014 I don\u2019t understand,\u201d you manage to say.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand. Stick to your training, and it will guide you through. Now go! We must defend the monastery.\u201d\n\nOn his final words, Brother Samuel gives you a gentle nudge towards the portal. Hundreds of feet in the air, you take in your surroundings. The hills in front are littered with soldiers. Smoke rises now from several locations in the monastery, your home. There is but one path in front of you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the portal", "result": "Chaos. The portal takes you into the monastery\u2019s courtyard. Arriving, you quickly dodge from a flying spear. The bodies of the invading soldiers are beginning to completely cover the courtyard floor. You breathe a sigh of relief when you don\u2019t see any fallen monks. The monks appear to be fighting well, but the sheer number from the mountainside is too many to count.\n\nThrough the doorway to the main hallway, you see Kassi engaged with several soldiers. Their armor is nowhere as neat as Seth\u2019s, if you could call it armor. It's more like rags, with some areas of reinforced leather, than actual armor. The long hair and unkempt beards of the invading soldiers make them seem more animal than man. They fight with the same savagery that you\u2019ve seen in your encounters with woodland creatures surrounding the monastery.\n\nNot wasting any time, you rush towards Kassi picking up a scimitar from one of the savages. Solely focused on Kassi, you impale the closest invader from the back. The sudden rush of blood and fallen ally alert the others of your presence. Savages on either side of you swing their swords at your head almost simultaneously. Dedicated to your training, you instinctively bend your torso backwards. Two blades fly harmlessly overhead. Recovering upright, you slash one\u2019s throat and gouge a deep cut through the other\u2019s chest. Now that you\u2019ve drawn the attention of the others, Kassi picks them apart one at at time. She\u2019s only armed with a small dagger, and you realize she\u2019s fighting as if unarmed, the dagger striking the killing blow.\n\n\u201cAre you ok, Kass?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seriously asking me that? Don\u2019t forget who taught you everything you know,\u201d she says confidently.\n\n\u201cOk, sorry I asked. What should we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw Brother Trevor and Seth head towards the library. If anyone knows what to do, it\u2019s them.\u201d\n\nYou make your way through the hallways, fighting off soldiers whenever they come near. Though you are well younger, the soldiers fight with little technique. Their swords moves as if through water. You stick to your training and finish most with a single counter. A slight redirection of their sword leaves them vulnerable to the killing blow. You do not hesitate, even though it is your first time in real combat. You do as you are trained.\n\nAfter several turns, you arrive to the library's double doors. The library is normally kept spotless, but the inside looks like a hurricane hit the room. Books, bookcases, and bodies cover the floor. In the center of it all, you see Seth. King Aeric\u2019s emissary appears to be unfazed by the battle and fights alone, no monks by his side. His red armor looks freshly made still, and then you realize the entire robe is blood-soaked; it\u2019s just hidden in the red color. His twin short swords work magnificently together. They glide through the air removing limb and whole heads for those who get too close. He notices you and Kassi and begins to fight his way down toward you.\n\nArriving near you, and still fighting off several enemies, he shouts. \u201cThere are too many of them. We must regroup at Aeric\u2019s keep. Gather all who you can and let\u2019s flee this place.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we will not abandon our home,\u201d Kassi states.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to argue, girl! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nSeth begins to whisper into a ring on his finger and punches his fist to the ground. Waves of flame fire from the position and sweep into the surrounding soldiers. Kassi screams at the collateral damage. The books in the area instantly light up and the fire begins to spread. With the fire spreading, you exit the library following Seth.\n\nSeth leads you back through the hallways, although in the opposite direction of the courtyard. After a series of twists and turns you end up in the meditation sanctuary. Rows of mats line the open room. A sizeable shrine sits in the center, covered with religious trinkets and sacred flowers. There are no signs of the battle here. Seth walks up to the shrine and examines it.\n\n\u201cI never enter a building without an escape plan. Ah, here we are,\u201d he comments.\n\nSeth bends one of the candlesticks near the shrine sideways and pulls another towards him. As he stands back, a low rumble begins from the shrine. Scraping heavily, the top of shrine starts to move to the side. You can see a short staircase from where the shrine used to lay, leading to an underground passageway.\n\n\u201cWe must make for King Aeric. If the western border has collapsed, we must inform him,\u201d Seth says jumping down. \u201cCome with me. It\u2019d be best to have monk acolytes accompany me to answer any questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave. The others need us,\u201d Kassi replies.\n\n\u201cAll is lost. We can only hope to avenge them. If you decide to stay, you will be choosing death.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d Kassi firmly states.\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Seth asks. \u201cAnswer quickly, we haven\u2019t much time.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with Seth", "result": "\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Kassi yells. \u201cFine, go ahead and leave us. You were never really one of us anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cEnough talk, kid,\u201d Seth intervenes.\n\nYou attempt to give Kassi a hug, but she backs away. You notice her eyes beginning to tear up, but she turns and runs before they can fall. Sounds of the battle echo into the meditation room. The soldiers have almost made their way to your position.\n\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Seth breaks the silence.\n\nYou follow him down the short steps into the narrow tunnel. There isn\u2019t any visible light, so Seth pulls a candle from beside the shrine and takes it with you. You march along in silence and near darkness. The occasional rat scurrying by is the only change in setting. After a few hours, the tunnel begins to incline slightly and you feel a subtle breeze. By now, the candle has long burned out. You follow behind Seth with your arms in front, grazing his back for direction. You keep your steady pace until he stops, suddenly, causing you to bump into his back.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d he utters, more to himself than you. A single rope hangs down in front of you. Looking up, you see a glimpse of a round opening way above you. It must be at least twice as high as the monastery\u2019s walls.\n\n\u201cAre you sure this is safe?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cMore safe than staying within the monastery walls,\u201d he answers. \u201cI\u2019ll climb first. Once I get to the top, I\u2019ll shake the rope. We better go one at a time just in case. Don\u2019t worry, kid. If it holds my weight, it\u2019ll hold yours too. Try to use your legs as much as possible to keep your grip from tiring. Alright, see you at the top.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re left alone in the dark, save for the small light above you. Now that things have settled a bit, you finally have time to think about the events that just happened. How could an entire army show up almost out of thin air? Kassi said King Aeric was supposed to protect the monastery. Why didn\u2019t his army show up? Then it hits you. Everyone you know is dead. Kassi, Brother Samuel, even Garth is gone. You are alone.\n\nThe rope begins to shake signaling your turn. You take a deep breath and begin to climb up.

Others, perhaps, were more naturally talented than I. Not to say I wasn\u2019t gifted; I definitely felt suited for this life, but my unwavering devotion to the practice set me apart from others. There were times in my early life I wished for a different fate.\n\nLife is hard enough without constant physical stress. Each time those thoughts would rise, I would force myself back to my practice, back to my true being. The fact is, those thoughts were born of my lesser, weak-willed nature. My training is meant to suppress the weakness inside.\n\nSeth was not a father figure, at least not in the same way I viewed Brother Samuel. With Samuel, I could tell he had my best interests in mind. Seth\u2019s motivations were unclear, though they mostly revolved around himself. I wonder if his influence guided me to a better path.

For more than a decade, the Empire\u2019s troops have tried, and failed, to capture the nation\u2019s capital. King Aeric\u2019s keep sits at the top of a mountain. It\u2019s a nightmare for the king\u2019s mobilization, but even worse for attacking armies.

The thought brings a tinge of sadness to your mind, but you quickly focus on your breath to clear the emotion.\n\n\u201cPsst.\u201d\n\nYou turn to see Estella, one of the apprentice mages.

The Emperor\u2019s troops have gotten lazy in the past few years. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re just waiting us out until the Empire can free up more troops for a grand-scale siege. Right now, they\u2019re content keeping us walled in.

You can tell he hasn\u2019t shaved in quite some time, despite the lack of full beard. Even though he wears the same robe as Seth, the attire of King Aeric\u2019s inner circle, his personal upkeep is well the opposite of the clean-cut Seth.\n\n\u201cI say patience, my king,\u201d Mordecai says. \u201cLet the Empire waste resources and manpower sitting at the bottom of our mountain. Eventually there will be a time to strike, but I\u2019m not so certain it\u2019s now.

You know he prefers to walk in silence, so there\u2019s no point in running to catch up to him. He leads you down a familiar path; you arrive at the castle training grounds.\n\nThe room is much more luxurious than the practice room in the monastery, though that is the case for nearly every room in the castle. It is a castle, after all. Various weapons line the room, neatly placed on racks. Cloth towels are folded in the corner to wipe down sweat and equipment after use. It definitely made for a less musty smell than the practice room in the monastery. Something about the place felt fabricated, almost too orderly. Your brief experience with combat already revealed the chaotic nature of war.

While the climb is steep, the rocks are jagged, leaving a fair amount of hand-holds for climbers. The seeming break in security would have you worried if not for the disarming of several traps along the way. Any intruder would be meet with death -- though not so swift, depending on the trap they sprung. You tie your longsword to your pack to prevent it from falling out and begin the climb.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look down, don\u2019t look down,\u201d you quietly repeat to yourself. The wind carries most of the words away from you. You find the climb isn't too difficult, though you're careful to preserve your energy.

You were going the right way, though to be fair, down feels as good a direction as any. Several minutes later, you come across a series of broken-off rocks. You slow your descent as you imagine the surrounding area might have loose hand-holds as well. Just as your arms start to exhaust, you eye a ledge of sorts. The jutting rock couldn't be more than five inches long, but it works well enough for you to stand on, leaning your back against the rock wall behind you. You rub your arms to get the blood flowing and roll your wrists a few times.\n\nIt's here that you finally look down. You're not too far up now, probably a few hundred feet, still not a height you'd survive falling from. The mountainside transitions into a thick forest. The tree-littered hills roll off in the distance, with only a few mountains poking up overhead. If you weren't inches away from death, you'd enjoy the view. Satisfied at your arm strength, you continue the journey down.\n\nWhen your feet finally hit the ground, you breathe a sigh of relief. You take a brief glance at the rocky pathway. The castle is a tiny dot in the distance, barely visible through the sunlight. A crumpled body lies not 20 feet from where you're standing. A victim of the climb down, his body looks freshly dead, though it's harder to tell with several bones sticking out from the skin. The man's face is unrecognizable. You search his body for anything useful and come up empty. Whatever things he was carrying is long gone. A few broken branches alert you of activity in the area.

You block the axe, but not how you would have liked due to the shield bash. The full force of the axe absorbs through your sword into your arm, sapping some of your strength.\n\nThe man\u2019s jaw clenches in determination as he attacks again. This time, you use your mobility to avoid the attack and side-step away. If anything\u2019s clear from his initial attack, you can\u2019t win a head-to-head battle, so you change your strategy in order to draw the tank of a man into your fight. His battle axe swings towards your head, but you\u2019re already just out of range. Immediately, you test his defenses, lunging forward and picking a high to low series of strikes. One of the strikes pierces his defense staggering him down to a knee. In his vulnerable state, you kick the shield from his grasp, from using it as a crutch to remain standing. Imitating Seth\u2019s sweeping motion, you spin allowing your sword to gain momentum from your body.

You, Richard, and the woman follow closely behind. Seth straps Wren to a chair in the center of the tent, hands behind the backrest.

There\u2019s a shaman, a man that speaks to spirits. He approached me, giving knowledge to an upcoming assault. I thought he was just a crazy old man, but sent a force on the off-chance he was correct. There\u2019s something...strange about him. Something powerful, mysterious, like you want to find out what it is, but then again, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying a shaman gave you battle plans? I thought you Imperials were more distrusting than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve served under bad leadership, leadership that doesn\u2019t listen or take advice from others. I promised myself I would be different.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is this shaman?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He appears in a mist of black smoke with gnarled staff at his side. He leans on it, always, because his back is crunched like he\u2019s caring a heavy burden. A dark hood covers his face. His voice is otherworldly, it\u2019s like a projection from behind the veil.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, this has got us nowhere,\u201d Seth answers.\n\nSuddenly, your vision tunnels again. The black edges focus on a single target. Mira. You\u2019re unable to speak. It\u2019s like an animalistic instinct taking over, compelling you to move, to act in survival. You hardly notice Seth drawing his dagger against Captain Wren\u2019s throat. A voice inside your mind speaks, echoing, resounding within your core, fading in and out, loud and quiet.\n\nMAKE HER SUFFER AS WE HAVE SUFFERED\n\nRichard notices your strange advance, and holds a hand out. \u201cWhoh, now. Are you ok?\u201d\n\nYou push past him, and slide your sword into Mira\u2019s chest. A soft laugh, more of a slow chuckle, escapes through the thin gap between your lips. Richard drops to a knee to catch the falling woman\u2019s body. Seth whirls around to see the commotion.\n\n\u201cWhat the fu--\" he starts to say before seeing Mira\u2019s blood dripping from the point of your sword.\n\nControl is back.\n\n\u201cI...uh. I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d you say, looking down.\n\nRichard and Seth exchange looks, unsure how to handle the situation. Seth walks to you and places a hand on your shoulder, comfortingly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. If we let her go, the Empire would spare no expense to find us. It\u2019s better this way,\u201d Seth says, sending another look to Richard.\n\nVisibly unhappy, Richard drops the leash end of the rope, no longer needing to hold Mira captive.

His light barefoot steps don\u2019t snap twigs or rustle fallen leaves. They\u2019re quiet, born of a lifetime of practice. At the age of ten, it was the tribe\u2019s tradition to send a boy coming into manhood into the wilderness, alone, with only a week\u2019s worth of supplies. They could return in a month, any attempt to return earlier would be met with shame on the entire family. The tribe had no place for weak men.\n\nEkk\u2019a's thoughts always return to his rite of passage, even now, almost twenty years later. He spent most nights shivering in the cold, unable to start a fire due to the attention it brought. Several boys were sent out at the same time, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for infighting to occur. After all, a knife to the back is easier than tracking your own hunt. The thought brought a slight smile to his lips. Some of the others took the easy approach. Ekk\u2019a didn\u2019t, relying on his prowess as a hunter to survive. He was strong, born of a family of warriors. Taking the easy approach would be dishonorable to their tradition.\n\nThrough two tree trunks, Ekk\u2019a spotted his prey. The buck is young, although still much larger than the average doe. Its antlers rise from its head like branches of a stream. The buck\u2019s head lifted for a moment, sensing the air. Too late. Ekka\u2019s arrow fired true, landing squarely in the buck\u2019s neck. One arrow was not enough to drop it, and it took off into the forest, a cursing Ekk\u2019a following.\n\nThe trail of blood and broken branches led to the outskirts of the demon. Ekk\u2019a knew he was getting close, but his buck would soon drop. The amount of blood loss clearly showed he would find it collapsed, breathing its final moments. If he had the Earth Mother\u2019s blessing, it would find it soon.\n\nThen he saw it. The demon\u2019s ruins. A crumbling castle, overgrown with grass. Large stone blocks scattered in the surrounding field. The front gate is simply an open arch; the actual gate has long fallen from its place. It\u2019s inviting, welcoming in newcomers to walk into the deteriorating walls. Ekk\u2019a spotted the fallen buck not 30 feet past the arch. Notching an arrow at the ready, Ekk\u2019a stepped through.\n\nThe breeze whispered to Ekk\u2019a. Soft voices, more of a lightless murmur, carried on the wind. His footsteps took him from the warmth of the sunlight into the chilling shade of the open archway. Despite the chill, Ekk\u2019a felt a bead of sweat run down the side of his face. Still holding the bow ready, he wiped the sweat with the back of his forearm. He was almost there. His hunt would be complete.\n\nJust when he arrived at the fallen animal, a flock of crows fly out from a nearby gap in the castle, filling the air with squawking and flapping of wings. Ekk\u2019a instantly ducked, and fired an arrow, dropping one of the birds. Ekk\u2019a suddenly felt another\u2019s presence.

It\u2019s the mix between a low growl and raspy, labored breath. Each word is articulated to perfection, slow and deliberate. Ekk\u2019a fired another arrow at the demon. To his disbelief, the arrow flies harmlessly through the figure and bounces from the opposite castle wall.\n\nYou are not him. Bring him to me.\n\nThe gnarled staff pointed Ekka\u2019s way, burning a symbol on his forehead.

As you wish.\n\nThe threat neutralized, if you could call it that, you immediately check on Seth. His fall wasn\u2019t as graceful as yours. Both of his legs appear broken, judging by the size of the boulder on them. Seth\u2019s eyes are closed, but at least his chest rises and falls with breath. He\u2019s alive, though in bad shape.

Seth immediately throws one of his swords at the shaman, which harmlessly flies through Lorthander and bounces off the wall behind him.\n\nIt\u2019s unwise to attack your healer.\n\n\u201cKeep your sorcery away. I can manage on my own,\u201d Seth says.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the luxury of time. Our leader needs you, all of you.\n\nYou look up to see members of the company staring down through hole in the floor where Seth and you fell. The spell that affected their mind is gone, and they watch you with interest. Lorthander brings his staff to Seth\u2019s legs. Green wisps swirl around the gnarled staff, lingering for a moment, and then they project into Seth\u2019s legs, repairing and strengthening bone and muscle. Seth bends his knees, testing the strength and then rises, still kicking his feet.\n\n\u201cWhat have you gotten ourselves into, kid?\u201d Seth asks. \"This is the same being that allied himself with the Empire and helped slaughter our friends.\"\n\n\u201cOnly what is necessary.

I will use all available tools to defeat the Empire, even one made from its own hand.\u201d\n\nYou regroup with the rest of the company.

The commander\u2019s thick mustache covers his top lip, but even then, you can see the tremble underneath.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d he shouts. \u201cLay down your arms and you will be given a merciful death.\u201d\n\nThe two knights beside him point their spears in your direction for emphasis.

At the last moment, you spin to your right and swipe your sword out in the his path. His charge takes him full force into your sword, separating his upper half from lower.\n\n\u201cYour taste for the theatrical is most amusing,\u201d the muffled voice of Horne speaks.\n\n\u201cAn enemy with nothing to lose is more dangerous than an overconfident one,\u201d you say wiping the blood from your sword.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time believe either pose a danger to you,\u201d he answers.\n\n\u201cI have a realistic understanding of my abilities,\u201d you answer. \u201cThough I\u2019m not prideful or short-sighted enough to believe I cannot be beaten.

We march forward.\u201d\n\nThe capital is built in a circular manner. The main keep lies in the center, surrounded by varying sections of the city. Besides the city walls, the residential and merchant portions of the city aren\u2019t defendable. The keep is where the true defense lies. Tightly packed buildings, built more vertical than horizontal, fill the city. As the city grew, it looks like the only option was to build up rather than out. There\u2019s only so much space within the city walls, even for a city as massive as the capital.\n\nAs you enter the city walls, alarm bells ring throughout the city. You don\u2019t see many civilians; the shut doors and closed shutters alert you to their location. It seems the news of your arrival traveled quicker than expected, although it\u2019s likely the people boarded up as the Empire\u2019s main force went to meet Seth.\n\nSeveral groups of the city\u2019s watch attempt to stop you, but they give less of a fight than the Imperial soldiers. There is little resistance up until the keep. The main gate into the fortress is shut, and you can see lines of soldiers standing at the ready within the courtyard. Archers stand overlooking the fortress\u2019 walls, firing down on your force as you draw close. You order your men to scatter into nearby streets to avoid being freely fired upon.\n\nLeave them to me.\n\nLorthander raises his staff into the air and shouts incoherent words. Magic pulses into the air in a ripple, as if a stone dropped into a body of water. The ripples extend from the staff and pulse through the archers. The heavy rain of arrows stop for a moment, and then you hear cries from the keep walls. You see some of the archers lifelessly fall from the top, leaving behind red stains and protruding bone on the ground below. The top of the keep becomes a chaotic mess of infighting. Imperial soldiers fire on their own and take up arms against one another, similarly to your first steps inside the crumbling ruins Lorthander resided in.\n\nNo longer exposed to arrow fire, you charge the front gate. Simultaneously, you and Lorthander blast the gate with magic. The mix of shadow bolt and psionic wave shatter the metallic gate. With a screech of metal, the gate implodes, unable to bear its weight in the weakened condition. White and gold armored soldiers stand at the ready, but don\u2019t meet your attack. They assume a defensive position, waiting for you to enter.\n\nKILL THEM ALL\n\n\u201cKi--\" you begin to command before resisting the voice. You feel it build within you. It wants to be released.

Their charge meets waiting white and gold, crashing into their defensive posture and ripping through their ranks. Through the mix of steel and bone, you remain focused on the inner gate to the keep. The soldiers are but a nuisance in your way.\n\nYour mouth opens, and a piercing scream emits. The world before you turns a dark, primal color as you take the role of hunter. Strength pours into your limbs unlike anything you\u2019ve felt before. Not even the training \u201cunlocking\u201d the Unbroken feels like this. It\u2019s exhilarating, like pure nirvana.

You start to shout commands to your men and then...\n\nSilence.\n\nThe words don\u2019t appear. A sickening feeling appears through the rush of power. You feel it deep within your consciousness, yours, not the Unbroken controlling your body. You\u2019ve simply become the vessel in which the dark power lives, a puppet to the Unbroken.\n\nDark energy materializes at your hands as the Unbroken tosses your sword aside, letting it clang harmlessly on the courtyard floor. Dark purple flames extend from your palms, solidifying, becoming translucent weapons, an axe in one hand and a sword in the other. With a supernatural leap, the Unbroken is whirlwind of shadowy sword and axe. The otherworldly weapons tear into Imperial soldiers' armor with ease. Each kill entices the Unbroken to greater heights of zeal, cutting down the Empire with vigor and thirst.\n\nYou see your men hesitate to draw near as they can clearly tell you\u2019re acting differently. The dark form of Lorthander watches with interest. Then you see him. The Emperor. He sits atop his wyvern, peering over the war-torn capital city from the next fortress tier. His pauldrons curve up in a crescent moon shape, flickering sunlight, matching the gold mask covering his face. You will your body to move, but it doesn\u2019t. The Unbroken is in command.\n\nThrough the eyes of the Unbroken, through your physical eyes, the world turns red, focused on a single target, the Emperor. The summoned weapons at your hands disappear as your body comes into a full sprint. Another supernatural leap takes you to the fortress\u2019 walls. Like a four-legged beast, you climb on all fours, traversing the vertical wall. The Unbroken climbs with frightening speed, unnaturally, like a lion closing in on his prey. Another leap takes you atop the Emperor\u2019s wyvern. Immediately, the Emperor summons a sword, similarly to the way the Unbroken did.\n\n\u201cFalse king,\u201d your mouth lifelessly speaks. \u201cYour simple parlor tricks may fool the common soldier, but they don\u2019t fool me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch power lies within your blood,\u201d the voice behind the golden mask speaks. \u201cYou are not a worthy vessel. I am the true Unbroken!\u201d\n\nThe Emperor grabs for the amulet at his neck, and even though its been decades, you recognize it. The Grandmaster\u2019s amulet. At the same time, the Emperor\u2019s wyvern jumps into the air, flapping its leathery wings. You\u2019re taken higher in the air. Wind rushes into your face, stinging your eyes, drying them with the sudden burst. Down below, the clashing armies are but insects, two waves of color molding into one. The Unbroken raises a palm and clamps your fist shut.\n\nThe air around the Emperor\u2019s hand fills with a dark purple cloud. Sizzling, like meat on a stovetop, starting around his hand. The flesh around the Emperor\u2019s hand rapidly decays, deteriorating, swept away like soft bark in a hurricane. He screams and loses hold of the amulet, letting it fall from his grasp down to the ground below. The Emperor regathers himself, and lets loose a shadow bolt towards you.\n\nThe bolt squarely hits your chest. Every instinct in your body screams for movement, to dodge, to evade the magic, but you\u2019re no longer in control. Instead of tearing a hole through your chest, the shadow bolt hits your chest and fades like a drying puddle.\n\n\u201cDid you really think your imitations would stand up against the real thing?\u201d the Unbroken speaks.\n\n\u201cYou will not take everything I\u2019ve built! I created the Empire and it\u2019s only through me the free lands have been conquered,\u201d the voice behind the mask shouts.\n\nYou realize the scenery below is different. Instead of the battlefield below, the wyvern\u2019s flight has taken you far from the capital city and towards the Moon Bluffs. Blue water stretches as far as you can see. Green-tipped cliffs overshadow the liquid body like a tall tree on a sunny day. Waves crash against the rocky slope in small explosions of white foam.\n\n\u201cHistory will not forget you, the fool who believed himself capable of possessing my power,\u201d the Unbroken speaks. \u201cI will make them remember as a cautionary tale. You may have convinced the people, but once they see me, and the true power I hold, they will discard you. You will become nothing. All this you built? It\u2019s fucking mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be no return without me. You owe me everything! I\u2019ll have you slowly bled out, like a slaughtered animal, and take your power for myself,\u201d the Emperor shouts back.\n\n\u201cEnough! I tire of this game,\u201d the Unbroken screams.\n\nThe Unbroken summons a sword from your palm and drives it into the neck of the wyvern. In a distressed cry, the beast descends in a dive straight for the edge of the bluffs. Gathering speed, your eyes water at the rush of air. Your hand grabs one of the wyvern\u2019s horns in order to keep your body from flying from the wyvern\u2019s back. The ground is fast approaching. There\u2019s no way either you or the Emperor can survive the impact.\n\nIn a crash of dust and rock, the wyvern hits the bluff, its momentum leaving behind a long line of crater as if a dry canal. Unable to stop or grab a foothold, the beast slips over the cliff and disappears to crashing waves below, the Emperor along with it. You watch the scene unfold, still in the air. Shadowy, dark purple wisps emanate from your shoulder blades in the loose form of wings. Unlike the wyvern, the wings don\u2019t flap, they merely float, swaying up and down, weightless, like a cloud.\n\nThe Unbroken wills your flight path downward, and you feel your feet touch the ground.\n\n\u201cSpeak, vessel. You are not without value,\u201d it commands.\n\nThe power enables you to speak, you, not the merely the voice within. \u201cHere I thought to use your power for myself, a tool to be used and discarded. In reality, it was the other way around. Were you always destined to be reborn through me?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy return was inevitable. It is a great honor to be the vessel in which my return manifests.

Translucent weapons appear in your hands, just in time, blocking the sudden assault. The other commanders in the great hall draw their swords, but don\u2019t attack yet, unsure which of their two leaders to aide.\n\n\u201cI should have done this years ago.

Their leader is gone, and his replacement is the very darkness mothers scare their children with. You cannot scream, you cannot move, you cannot react. The Unbroken is in control. He strikes them down with pleasure at your lips. He doesn\u2019t finish them fast, each man is given several cuts before finishing the final blow.\n\nSlowly, one by one, each man drops, a victim to the dark power. All that remains is Seth, standing among the fallen bodies of his allies. His eyes briefly dart to their bodies, taking in their death as motivation to continue. Seth\u2019s twin blades arc low, then high in a sweeping motion, always working, intertwined, to find an opening in your defense. The Unbroken parries and deflects the blades away, even allowing one high strike to narrowly miss just above your head. You understand it\u2019s turned into a game, one that the Unbroken will finish as soon as he\u2019s done toying with your mentor. Seth lunges forward.\n\nThe translucent weapons tear through the back of Seth\u2019s heels, sending him sprawling to the floor. Seth's pair of blades fly from grasp, sliding just out of reach from his outstretched hands. He turns to your approaching footsteps. He starts to say something, but slow piercing from the translucent sword point turns his words into a soft gurgle.

In our position, they would put us to the axe,\u201d a nearby soldier comments.\n\nYour gaze falls on the man speaking out. He nervously looks around, hoping someone nearby will support his decision.\n\nCalmly, you address him. \u201cThat\u2019s what separates us from them. There\u2019s no honor in execution, in defeating an unarmed prisoner. The day is won. We mustn\u2019t stain the glory of our victory with massacre.\u201d\n\n...\n\nTheir cheers keep you up. Late into the night, inebriated shouts following unintelligent laughter fill the air. You sit, kneeling, in a room deep in the servant corridor in attempt to find peace and quiet. You don\u2019t. The city is alive; fires burn in the streets, illuminating the destructive behavior of the men, your men. Even here, in the corner of the keep, the night breeze carries their drunken cries, partially mixed with smoke from the fires.\n\nA knock at the door appears, distracting you momentarily from the army\u2019s celebration. Standing outside is Seth holding two tankards. He offers you one, which you take with gratitude.\n\n\u201cWe did it. The Empire is no more. Tomorrow we\u2019ll abolish the unified government and allow each territory to rule themselves. It\u2019s taken decades, but we finally made it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cHistory has changed for the better,\u201d you answer. \u201cAny word of the Emperor? Well, I should say, the former Emperor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been sightings of a wyvern heading towards the Ellehorn Forest. It\u2019s as good of a place for someone who doesn\u2019t want to be found,\u201d Seth replies.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I don\u2019t blame him,\u201d you say, taking a small sip from the tankard. The ale tingles on your tongue, bursting with a sweet, frothy flavor.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. Sure, they\u2019re overindulging a little bit, but this is the greatest day of their lives. Let them celebrate, and not to worry, their penance will be a splitting headache in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without you, Seth. Your guidance kept me on the path, even when victory felt far away. I have no illusion that your part is equally, if not more, instrumental in the Empire\u2019s defeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get no argument from me there,\u201d Seth says with a smile.\n\nSuddenly, you know what you must do. You place the tankard on a nearby table and strap your sword on. Your possession are few, and you pack them in a traveling pack. The small lantern illuminating the room is extinguished, leaving you in the night\u2019s darkness. Seth\u2019s figure stands at the doorway, still. His crimson robe looks ceremonial in the backlight of the hallway\u2019s torches.\n\n\u201cMy part is over here. Politics don\u2019t interest me. I didn\u2019t come all this way to rule over my fellow man. I saw evil and had to act. The Empire is no more, and perhaps we can live in a peaceful time. I\u2019ve witnessed the good of man, along with the darkness that can inhabit one\u2019s heart. Ellehorn forest you say? Nature has always been a welcomed ally, which is more than I can say for the city here.\u201d\n\nSeth\u2019s eyes meet yours. \u201cThis is it then.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the bards sing of the last mountain monk, survivor of the monastery massacre, and conqueror of the Empire.\u201d\n\nYou place your hand on Seth\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet them sing what they will.

You cover your head with the hood of your cloak in order to not draw attention to yourself. After crossing the main hallway to the other wing of the keep, you arrive in one of the mage training rooms. It\u2019s an open room with several magically enhanced dummies at the far end. The entire room, from floor to ceiling, is metal to prevent a stray fireball from burning down the place. A group of people huddling in the middle turn at your arrival.\n\n\u201cReally?

By the mage\u2019s comments, it doesn\u2019t sound like they know what is happening.\n\nNo, you owe Estella a favor and trust her not to leave any permanent, damaging effects. You aren\u2019t super close, but close enough where you don\u2019t think she would willingly put you in harm\u2019s way-- at least, not anything serious. You try to clear your senses. If you can focus on something real, then the illusionary effects might subside a bit. It\u2019s not unlike the rope climb from the monastery; if you focus on the rope, and don\u2019t look down, then it\u2019s smooth sailing. You flash a quick thumbs up.\n\n\u201cSee? Told you he could handle himself,\u201d you hear Estella say. Her words are the last thing you hear before the world spins into nothingness.\n\nWhirling darkness becomes your reality. Incoherent whispers surround your ears, fading in and out of existence. You\u2019re lightless as if a storm cloud in the still night. You find yourself in the monastery\u2019s courtyard. The giant angelic statue overshadowing the courtyard is pure and without cracks, opposed to the scarred structure you were used to seeing. The Grandmaster is sitting on a bench next to a youthful man. You will yourself forward towards the two men.\n\n\u201cThis news is most troubling,\u201d the Grandmaster says.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be true,\u201d the young man says. \u201cThe lineage of the Unbroken should have died centuries ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same could be said for Osborne, and yet, here we are,\u201d the Grandmaster answers. \u201cKeep this to yourself.

We\u2019ll continue this discussion in my study.\u201d\n\nThe young man stands up and stretches out his arms.

No way,\u201d you answer. \u201cCome on, we better rejoin with the others.\u201d\n\nYou and Kassi exit the meditation room and navigate back through the hallways. You hear battle sounds almost immediately. The fight is working its way deeper into the monastery. You run into a few eager soldiers along the way. You can only guess they tore away from the main force to claim treasure first. They don\u2019t get the chance. You and Kassi don\u2019t leave any breathing.\n\nSuddenly, the monastery\u2019s tower bell begins to ring, leaving a sinking feeling in your chest. In these circumstances it can only mean one thing: surrender. Voices bring you back to reality. The clash of steel fills your ears no more. The battle has subsided. The voices appear to come from outside. You gaze out a window overlooking the courtyard to see what\u2019s happening.\n\nMonks stand in the center of a circle, surrounded by the invading soldiers. The Grandmaster is near the edge, fiercely arguing with one of the invading soldiers. You assume it to be their leader by the way he\u2019s dressed. Instead of the ragged armor, he\u2019s in full chain mail and the spear in his hand is far more intricate of a weapon than you\u2019ve run into. Instead of the generic sword, it\u2019s dyed completely black. In fact, it\u2019s the only weapon of the soldiers you\u2019ve run into that looks as if thought was poured into creating it. The argument between the soldier and the Grandmaster continues until a war horn pauses it.\n\nThe horde of soldiers seem to understand the war horn\u2019s signal because they move back to the courtyard\u2019s walls to create more space. Through high arched entryway, you see a platoon of soldiers enter wearing white and gold. Unlike the invading force, these ones are well-equipped. They march in unison. The large tower shields they bear create an impenetrable wall. If you had to guess, you\u2019d bet their combat strategy keeps the same synergy as their march. The white and gold soldiers part in the center, and one of their own walks to the front meeting the Grandmaster face to face.\n\nUnlike the others, this one doesn\u2019t have a shield. A sizable greatsword hangs on his back and a full helm with two horns sits on his head. He addresses the Grandmaster, and luckily you\u2019re just in range to make out his words.\n\n\u201cIt is finished. Swear your fealty to the Emperor and you will be granted life.\u201d\n\nYou catch a twinge of pride in his voice.\n\n\u201cWe serve no one but the divine,\u201d the Grandmaster answers.\n\nThe soldier with the greatsword crosses his arms. \u201cKeep whatever archaic beliefs you may have. The Emperor only demands your service in this lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid we cannot oblige. Our worldly alignment is already devoted to King Aeric. We simply cannot turn our back on promises made, despite the circumstances,\u201d the Grandmaster answers.\n\n\u201cSuch a shame. Apparently the rumors of the deady mountain monks are simply not true.\u201d\n\nWith his reply, the soldier pulls the greatsword from his back and swings through the air in a single motion. The jagged blade cuts through the air and then stops. The Grandmaster\u2019s open hand catches the blade mid-air. A layer of magic emanates from his palm, protecting his skin from the deadly sword.\n\n\u201cNot even your mysticism can protect you from the Empire\u2019s might, monk,\u201d the soldiers speaks.\n\nThe greatsword begins to emit sparks as if from a blacksmith\u2019s hammer. The Grandmaster\u2019s eyes start to grow wide as he experiences the power of the weapon. The blade slices through the Grandmaster\u2019s open palm, removing the hand, and leaving a large gouge in his chest. The Grandmaster\u2019s body his the ground with a solid thud, his severed hand closely following.\n\nThe group of herded monks look shaken at the sight of their leader\u2019s fallen body. The Grandmaster, the spiritual and mystical leader of the monastery, lies bleeding on the ground. The piercing gray eyes that frightened acolytes are now lifeless. From within the herd, you see Brother Samuel step forward.\n\n\u201cWe will do what you say. Just don\u2019t harm anyone else,\u201d Brother Samuel says.\n\nThe soldier with the greatsword removes his helm and shakes out his shoulder-length hair. He\u2019s much younger than you expected. He couldn\u2019t be much more than thirty years old.\n\n\u201cThe Empire has no room for misguided ideologies,\u201d he states to the army around him.\n\nOn his command the onslaught of soldiers commences. The sheer number surrounding the monks overpower the seasoned monks. Though an average monk may be able to slay tens of men, thousands surround them. You witness several spears piercing Brother Samuel\u2019s gut. Before you can cry out at the death of your mentor, Kassi\u2019s open palm covers your mouth.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, but we need to run,\u201d she whispers.\n\nYou nod. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do,\u201d you softly speak through tears.\n\nYou and Kassi leave the window's vantage point and sneak down the end of the hallway. One of the open windows leads to the rooftop. With most of the focus on the gathered monks, you\u2019re able to silently walk on the rooftop opposite the direction of the courtyard.

The building sporting a wooden sign with a carved tankard and bed was usually the first place people stopped. The brothel next to it was a close second.\n\nYou tie your horse to a post and look to Kassi. \u201cNot the friendliest looking place, eh?\u201d you comment.\n\n\u201cNowadays I consider any time we\u2019re not greeted at swordpoint as friendly,\u201d she replies.\n\nAs she dismounts, the light rain collected on her cloak scatters in a puff of droplets. Her bright blonde hair is now dyed a dark autumn red. It\u2019s tied into several loops all ending in a single tie in back. If she were to untie it, you know it would reach near to her waist. Your own has grown out considerably longer than the cropped monastery cut.\n\nYou eye the white and gold sigil posted outside the inn: a wreath crown at the hilt of an upside down sword. Every town, village, and city you\u2019ve encountered in the past few years has flown the empire\u2019s colors. Places that openly rebelled against the empire were burned. Surrounding areas learned quickly to post the sigil...and their allegiance. The land may have been conquered, but King Aeric\u2019s keep remains standing.

Long bench-like tables fill the interior. You see the kitchen almost directly behind the bar. A few downtrodden patrons sit milking their cups, scattered at the tables. No one appears to be conversing with one another. The bar looks empty, save for a traveling merchant. You catch a glimpse of graying hair as the waitress rushes past carrying an armload of dishes.\n\nYou find two empty barstools and sit. The wooden seat is only slightly less comfortable than your saddle. The warmth of the inn makes up for it, though. Your eyes focus on the bottles in front of you. Brother Samuel had let you try a sip of his mead once. Besides that, the drink hasn\u2019t touched your lips. Part of you is curious, and the other wants to keep your senses sharp.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about ordering that junk, are you?\u201d Kassi asks noticing your gaze.\n\n\u201cI admit it\u2019s crossed my mind. More than a few times, actually, but I need my wits,\u201d you answer.\n\nThe merchant, overhearing your conversation, butts in.\n\n\u201cGood. More for me then. Say, you two look a little young to be traveling alone. Where\u2019re your parents?\u201d\n\nYou eye the merchant. A subtle sway in his head alerts you to his drink level.

This time quieter, so the Merchant won\u2019t hear.\n\n\u201cKass, I\u2019m more than aware of that fact,\u201d you answer. \u201cI\u2019d just prefer to not gather any more attention than we already have. By the villagers reaction to our arrival, we\u2019re probably the talk of the town. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the local authorities come knocking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for our contact to see. I imagine that conversation to be less than pleasant. Speaking of our contact, where is he?\u201d Kassi adds.\n\n\u201cNot sure. The message said he\u2019ll approach us.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably watching us to see if we\u2019re empire spies or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cDepends. The average person probably assumes they\u2019re being watched and likely is on their best behavior. If you really want to know their loyalty, you\u2019re better off backing them into a corner and forcing them to decide.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of which\u2026\u201d you begin to say as the inn door flies wide open. Two soldiers enter followed by a tall, thin old man. The man\u2019s robes are fine quality. He moves with a certain air of authority, and you guess he\u2019s not someone who likes repeating himself. The trio marches up to the bar.\n\n\u201cSo this is the man selling empire secrets,\u201d he comments disapprovingly. \u201cTake him.\u201d\n\nThe two soldiers grab the drunk merchant and pull him from his seat. The Merchant attempts to say something, but a fist from one of the soldiers quiets him. He gazes towards you pleadingly.\n\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t like that look on you,\u201d Kassi whispers. \u201cLast time I saw that look, we were given chamber pot duty for a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollow my lead,\u201d you say with a wink. You turn towards the soldiers and put on your best performance.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t take my father,\u201d you beg. \u201cHe\u2019s an honest man, he\u2019s just trying to take care of our sick mother.\u201d\n\nKassi does her best to support you, although she\u2019s a little stiff in your opinion. \u201cYes, uh, that\u2019s right. We\u2019ll starve without him.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers loosen their grip a bit and turn to the old man for direction. \u201cMagistrate?\u201d one of them asks.\n\nThe Magistrate squints his eyes towards you. \u201cYou\u2019re too well-dressed to be related to this swindler. He\u2019d sooner steal your cloak than feed you or your \u2018sick mother.\u2019 Take them as well. I do not know what game you\u2019re playing, but it\u2019s against the law to interfere with official government business.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice try, kids,\u201d the Merchant manages to say before receiving another punch.\n\n\u201cGuess we better try the backup plan,\u201d Kassi says.\n\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d you start to reply.\n\nBefore you finish speaking, Kassi grabs a nearby plate and smashes it into the Magistrate\u2019s face. Shards of glass shatter into the air as the old man crumbles back. The soldiers look surprised at the sudden violence and toss the Merchant aside to focus on you and Kassi. Your right fist nails one of the soldiers on the chin. As his body falls to the floor, your knee meets his face mid-air.\n\nKassi fires a series of punches and kicks into the other soldier. He tries to keep up, but slowly begins to fade as the flurry continues. Taking mercy on him, you knock him out with a hook to the jaw. Kassi looks at you, a bit surprised, and then draws her dagger.\n\n\u201cWait, Kass, I don\u2019t think--\u201d you begin to say before she cuts downward with the razor sharp blade. Just before the blade pierces the soldier, it\u2019s suddenly stopped. The Merchant stands between the two with his dagger drawn. The two stand unmoving, without speaking for a few seconds as you take in what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the contact,\u201d you state.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct!\u201d the \u201cMerchant\u201d answers with a grin. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve passed the test. Man, I thought for sure you were just going to stand there and do nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t alone here you know,\u201d you say looking towards the waitress and the silent patrons in the room.\n\n\u201cThis entire inn is devoted to the cause, friend. They\u2019re all in on it. Now I\u2019d prefer it if your pretty sidekick here would put away her blade.\u201d\n\nKassi scoffs at his remark. \u201cPfft, sidekick? You really have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nFeeling the need to calm things before they get out of hand you quickly jump in. \u201cLet\u2019s get on with the meeting. I believe you have some valuable information to share with us.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMerchant\u201d nods. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. We\u2019ve a cellar in this place. Many a good scheming is done in cellar. Oh, and call me Vishal.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "The cellar", "result": "You follow Vishal through the kitchen into the back pantry. He opens a large cupboard and reveals the hidden back to a staircase below. The cellar is lined with barrels and debris. In the center, sits a single table with a map spread over the surface. Vishal kicks around in the debris and finally pulls two lanterns from the junk. He lights and sets both on the table.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to join the resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to fight the Empire, yes,\u201d you answer. \u201cAn enemy of the Emperor is an ally in my book.\n\n\u201cAhh, so you have a personal vendetta then. That\u2019s the only reason you\u2019d be here. What tragedy occurred in your short lifetime to project you into a life of violence? Dead parents perhaps?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reason is of no concern to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, my young renegade.

Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Vishal sighs. \u201cI specialize in knowledge. I know things and have friends in the most unattainable positions in the nation. I admit I\u2019m a bit surprised, not even I knew about your survival. My friends and I strive towards the same goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might find that a near impossible goal. The Empire\u2019s might is vast, and their power is spreading,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cExactly. I\u2019m counting on the Emperor\u2019s conquest to be his biggest weakness.\u201d\n\nVishal eyes your confused look and continues.\n\n\u201cThe Empire is unsustainable in the long run. They have to import goods from the farthest nations in order to keep it supplied. It\u2019s gathering territory, too quickly, and does not have the resources to manage its upkeep. Eventually, it will implode on itself. I\u2019m here to speed the process along. A shipment goes missing here, a food supply rots, an inventory tally gets miscounted. I\u2019m in the business of sabotage, my friend. Why has no one been able to resist the Emperor? They tackle the Empire\u2019s strength head on. It\u2019s like running straight into a charging bull. I\u2019d rather stand on the edge of a cliff and watch the bull run itself over the edge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re warriors, not skilled in the art of deception.

I\u2019ve witnessed personally the horrors of their conquered tribes. You do realize the Emperor's actual army, the ones in white and gold, are only a small portion of the soldiers at his command. They\u2019re his elite force and only deployed in special circumstances. The rest of the time, the Emperor sends the armies from his conquered territories to do his dirty work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen such tribes. They seem more beast than man,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cExactly. They\u2019re undisciplined, violent men who get to run lawless because they bring more captured land to the Empire. The Emperor allows, even encourages, evil men to roam free and he\u2019s just as bad as them in my opinion. Perhaps a bit worse because he has the power to stop them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMakes sense. Were you in covert operations before the war?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way...my guise as a merchant is simply wearing the costume of my previous life. Before the war, I had an extensive trade network. A little favor here, a little favor there sort of thing to important people. I always know who I get into business with.\u201d\n\nKassi rolls her eyes sensing Vishal\u2019s theme.\n\nVishal continues. \u201cMost people wanted to help after seeing the evil actions of the Empire. Others needed to be convinced. In the end, it\u2019s an impressive organization if I should say so myself, and we\u2019ve been a thorn in the Empire\u2019s side for many years now.

I suppose you\u2019re used to sharing a room though,\u201d Yuri says finishing with a nervous half cough, half laugh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful just to have a roof over our heads,\u201d you answer shaking Yuri\u2019s hand.\n\nThe door opens with a nasty squeal, and the room itself mirrors the small size of the inn. A single bed in the center takes up almost half of the floor space. To the right wall, a tiny desk is wedged in the corner. You walk in and place your traveling gear on the floor. Kassi lights the lantern on the desk.\n\n\u201cRather tight quarters, huh?\u201d Kassi comments.\n\n\u201cMore space and privacy than in the monastery barracks,\u201d you answer.\n\nThe mention of your childhood home turns both of your moods somber. Outside, you hear a stray dog barking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost 15 years since we were there,\u201d Kassi comments. \u201cAnd the Empire\u2019s strength has only grown since.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had our fair share of victories.

You aren\u2019t nervous about the mission. You have no personal feelings towards Kassi. You only know the practice. The cramped room doesn\u2019t allow you to move much, but that allows you to adjust the technique to fit the environment. Time has no meaning in your state. You finish by sitting cross-legged in front of the bed in reflection.\n\nYou open your eyes to find the room completely dark. You hear soft breathing coming from the bed. Kassi. You feel on the ground for bedding and find nothing. Either Kassi didn\u2019t think to leave some for you or she fell asleep before throwing down a blanket and pillow.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay on the floor", "result": "While you\u2019ve shared a bed numerous times, you think climbing in unannounced might signal the wrong message to Kassi. You did not need to distract your minds with such thoughts before the mission. You refocus your mind on the monk\u2019s teachings.\n\nYour physical body is not who you are. It\u2019s merely a sanctuary for your Spirit. We train the body to be a better home for the Spirit to reside. Giving in to bodily pleasures are a denial of the Spirit. Protect the Spirit at all costs.\n\nYou know you require sleep, but put Kassi\u2019s interests ahead of your own. You shut your eyes still sitting cross-legged. Meditation could last for hours in the monastery, so you weren\u2019t unaccustomed to long periods of time spent in this position. You attempt to align your thoughts with the Spirit within.\n\nYour mind draws to your past. The countless hours spent training with Kassi before sunrise and after sunset. You had trouble keeping up at first, but each day you\u2019d improve. Eventually, you arrived to the point where the training sessions were less one-sided and turned equally beneficial for each of you.\n\nYour thoughts continue to draw from your past, towards the days in the monastery. You feel as if you\u2019re living the moments in real time. You find yourself in the training room, Kassi stands your opposition. The thin pad of the mat beneath your feet is a familiar texture. She charges toward you with her wooden dagger in attack position. You easily side-step the assault, at least that\u2019s what she wants you to believe.\n\nYour step to the right brings you into the trap she set. One quick pivot brings the wooden dagger into your stomach and then gently touches your neck.\n\n\u201cYield,\u201d she commands.\n\n\u201cNice move, Kass. I yield,\u201d you say dropping your wooden sword. It falls and bounces a few times on the mat.\n\nThe wooden dagger presses harder into your neck.\n\n\u201cI said yield,\u201d Kassi says again. The way her voice deepened at the end sends a chill down your spine. It was not her voice, but otherworldly, sinister.\n\n\u201cKassi, what\u2019s going on,\u201d you start to say backing up.\n\nKassi\u2019s face begins to distort. Her skin droops from her face, and her eyes turn black. She walks towards you flinching as if an unseen needle is piercing her body. Then you realize you\u2019ve lost the ability to move. You try to cry out, and find your voice is gone as well. Frozen, dread falls over your body as if someone\u2019s holding your head underwater.\n\nKassi walks up to you and stares into your eyes with two onyx beads within her skull. Her head tilts slightly. Then she breaks into a mad cackle as if mocking your inability to react. She holds one of her own fingers to your face and snaps it sideways. Her laugh intensifies with each finger she snaps. The pure white teeth within her mouth have turned to a decaying black. She holds her hand of broken fingers closer to your face. Her laugh splatters spit onto your face.\n\nSuddenly, she crumbles to her knees staring towards the floor. Her arms fold in her lap clutching the wounded hand supportively. The mad cackle slowly turns into light sobbing. You\u2019ve never heard Kassi cry before, and hearing it for the first time brings tears to your own eyes. The power that prevents you from moving releases and you fall to all fours in front of her. You both sit there crying until you notice she\u2019s stopped.\n\nYou slowly gaze towards her still-drooped head to see why the crying stopped. A figure, masked in shadowy wisps stands in front of you holding Kassi\u2019s lifeless body. One of its arms reveals a curved blade. The shade slices upwards and splits Kassi\u2019s body in half. The pieces fall on either side of you. It walks towards you, but does not use the blade. It places a hand to your cheek, almost as if consolation. Its touch feels like diving into a frozen lake. Then it grips around your neck and pulls you to its eye level. A slow, resonating laugh begins in your mind. Its hand curls around your neck tighter as the laugh grows deafening.\n\nYou awake to Kassi gripping both of your shoulders.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you plainly ask.\n\n\u201cYour body was shaking uncontrollably against the bedpost. It woke me up,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI had a nightmare, like the ones I had as a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she touches your cheek. The act reminds you of the shade. \u201cCome, let\u2019s meditate until morning.\u201d\n\nShe takes a seat next to you cross-legged.

On the way, you had met with one of Vishal\u2019s contacts who had a cart prepared full of freshly harvested fruits. Vishal explained you needed a valid reason to be crossing through the Edge. Vishal assumes the guise of merchant once again and you, Kassi, Yuri, and Gregory, the hired protection.\n\nYou turn a bend and the outpost appears before you. Built partly into the mountainside, you immediately understand the strategic location of the fort. No army would dare marching along the road. The road\u2019s only wide enough for around 10 soldiers or so to march side by side. The treacherous conditions are too much for hauling siege equipment. Whoever controls the road has a firm hold on transporting troops and goods in and out of the territory. You couldn\u2019t have chosen a better place to attack, at least not one that isn\u2019t a castle full of soldiers. You focus on your breath to calm your nerves.\n\nWhen you approach the front gate a voice shouts out. \u201cState your business or be on your way.\u201d\n\nYou look up to see a woman with chestnut hair peering down at you.\n\n\u201cI run an orchard on the outskirts of Estabrook,\u201d Vishal answers. \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s troops have kindly provided me with a wealth of business. So much, in fact, I can\u2019t keep my trees producing quickly enough to meet the demands.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what brings you to the Edge?\u201d\n\n\u201cExpansion,\u201d Vishal smiles.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of protection for an orchard farmer.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast harvest, one of my carts was set upon by resistance members. They stole an entire shipment \u2018for the cause.\u2019 I\u2019ll not leave my cargo undefended any longer. Costs less to hire a few swords, than lose a whole cart.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have too many swords nowadays,\u201d the woman replies. \u201cFollow the directions into the inspection zone. No sudden movements; our archers fire first, ask questions later.\u201d\n\nThe gate swings open with a squeal. You cautiously enter into the fort. Above you, archers train their bows on the cart. Their steady hands, along with the confidence in their eyes, make you believe the woman\u2019s threat is not a bluff. One of the fort\u2019s guards leads the cart into an open area of the outpost.\n\nSatisfied any hidden attackers would be fully exposed, he pulls the canvas back uncovering the cart\u2019s contents. Bright orange, red, and green shine in the morning sun. The fruit provided by Vishal\u2019s contact fit your story. The soldier motions to the surrounding soldiers, and you see them ease up. The archers still keep their arrows nocked, but release their draw.\n\nA man with short cropped hair and graying beard approaches Vishal. \u201cGreetings, farmer. I am the commander in charge. Will you join me in my office?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat seems to be the problem, commander?\u201d Vishal asks.\n\n\u201cNothing at all. I simply have a few questions for you. Not to worry, you\u2019re completely safe here and can leave your hired help behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Vishal answers.

Surrender your weapons to the Lieutenant.\u201d\n\nThe woman who first yelled at you from the gate walks over and takes your swords. She exchanges a quick look with the commander.

Vishal tosses her an apple on the way past. The commander leads you through a narrow tunnel. Soldiers salute as you pass by. The two stationed outside the office pat you for hidden weapons and then allow your entry.\n\nThe Commander sits into a leather-padded chair placed behind a sturdy-looking desk. His leather armor settles against the similar material at his back. He folds his hands on the desk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the first non-military traveler we\u2019ve seen in months. How does the war fare for civilians?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for business, bad for life-expectancy,\u201d Vishal answers.\n\n\u201cSuch is the nature of war,\u201d the Commander speaks.

I have a favor to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a letter for you to deliver. My wife and kids are in a small city on the outskirts of the capital.\u201d\n\nVishal takes the sealed envelope and weighs it in the air.\n\n\u201cMust be an important note. Must be long too, judging from the weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is. Listen, I hope I can depend upon your discretion. Do this for me and you\u2019ll be in my favor. It\u2019s no small thing to have favor from a commander in the Emperor\u2019s employ.\"\n\n\u201cYou have yourself a deal,\u201d Vishal shakes the commander\u2019s hand. \u201cBy the way, do you have any idea when the war will end? I much prefer traveling without risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, it doesn\u2019t look like the conflict will end any time soon. Luckily, we\u2019re quite a distance from the front lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you get your fair share of action. This is a key location for mobilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as much as you\u2019d think. The taking of this outpost would require substantial losses to their numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that military mind of yours, always thinking in terms of numbers and superiority. You haven\u2019t considered a well-defended spot such as this is vulnerable to a small team\u2019s infiltration,\u201d Vishal says.\n\n\u201cCareful, farmer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll it takes is one poisoned apple, and you have an entire military fort at your disposal.\u201d\n\nThe Commander\u2019s face goes white. He remembers the apple Vishal tossed to the Lieutenant. He springs from his chair and grips Vishal by the collar. You and Kassi start to react, but Vishal waves you off.\n\n\u201cGive me the antidote,\u201d he spits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not daft enough to have it on me,\u201d Vishal answers. \u201cThen you could simply torture me for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is if you want your precious lieutenant to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d the Commander loosens his grip. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want your undivided loyalty. You strike me as an honorable man and I\u2019m willing to give you the antidote if you swear to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to stop me from killing you after I receive the antidote?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour honor, of course.\u201d\n\nThe Commander releases his grip in defeat.\n\n\u201cI swear my loyalty to you and your cause,\u201d he speaks barely louder than a whisper. \u201cJust give me the antidote.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need to look so downtrodden. I always take care of my friends,\u201d Vishal says. \u201cNow we must be off, I have a letter to deliver. You\u2019ll receive the antidote later this week...along with your new orders.\u201d\n\nWhen you arrive back to the wagon, you see the soldiers have eased up. A couple of them are even engaged in conversation with Yuri and Gregory. Now that you\u2019re back in the open, your weapons are handed back. You strap your sword on and something feels different. The familiar weight feels off. You remove the blade and examine the sheath. Tucked between where your hilt and sheath meet is a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cEverything ok?\u201d Kassi asks noticing you removed the sword.\n\n\u201cYeah, just making sure those soldiers didn\u2019t tamper with anything,\u201d you reply.\n\nIn order to hold true to your story, you leave the Narrow\u2019s Edge outpost and travel deeper into Empire territory. Vishal explained you\u2019d spend have to spend at least a week there before returning back the way you came to Estabrook. Unsurprisingly, Vishal had people to meet during that time.

You're a thorn in the Empire's side, but the beast lives on despite your minor annoyances.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Visit the tavern", "result": "Just as the note said, your journey with Vishal takes you to Searing Rock. The city lies at the base of a dormant volcano. You can think of many places you\u2019d rather build a city than at the base of a volcano. When voicing it to Yuri, he offers a reasonable explanation.\n\n\u201cSome folks figured out to use the place for smithing. They built several deep underground forges. The city just sort of built around them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMight as well be building on sand,\u201d Kassi comments.\n\nVishal leads your small band to a middle-class inn to keep appearances, even though he could afford the nicest place in the city. As his \u201cniece and nephew,\u201d you and Kassi get your own room. You practice your daily forms in the room, this one having more floor space than the dinky room in Estabrook. Once Kassi is asleep, you quietly sneak out. You thought about asking her to come with you, after all, you did everything together, but you decided it best she could speak her uninvolvement, truthfully, if things turned south.\n\nYou navigate through the city streets towards the eastern wall. After being the recipient of two drunken threats, invitation from an alley whore, and catching a thief\u2019s hands in your pocket (one of them was promptly removed), you see the sign for Craven\u2019s Refuge. The two-story structure is partly attached to the city wall behind it. The inside is almost pitch black. Seating booths line the walls. Features are hard to distinguish, and you assume that is by design. A well-dressed man in black greets you upon entry.\n\n\u201cReservation?\u201d he asks. The tone of his voice subtly suggests he knows the answer to his question.\n\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s been arranged. I\u2019m here to see M,\u201d you answer.\n\nThe man\u2019s gaze briefly floats to your sword before returning.\n\n\u201cVery well. The lady will see you now. Please do not do anything to disturb the other guests.\u201d\n\nThe man leads you to the back corner of the room. As you pass by various booths and tables, guests pause their conversation until you\u2019re out of range to hear. He brings you to a booth at the far wall that looks exactly like the others. Both seats are empty and the man motions for you to sit on the right side. You take your seat and wait patiently. Suddenly, the seat swivels 180 degrees and the shadowy interior is replaced with a normally lit room. Your seat is facing a familiar woman: Lieutenant Mathers.\n\n\u201cNarrow\u2019s Edge not treating you well enough?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cHeh, it has its moments. Like, for example, when the entire military outpost was brought to its knees by a single woman\u2019s actions,\u201d she answers.\n\n\u201cI take it you\u2019re not simply a lieutenant in the Empire\u2019s army.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow where in the world would you come up with that crazy idea?\u201d Seeing your unchanged reaction to her sarcasm, she continues. \u201cSorry, I forget that you\u2019re young and haven\u2019t experienced the world much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen my fair share. I\u2019ve experienced enough to know that having a strong sword arm and close allies are necessary for survival,\u201d you reply.\n\n\u201cHmm, perhaps I was wrong to judge your blank look as naivety. I suppose you\u2019re also someone who would rather get straight to the point instead of dancing around the edges. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here. I\u2019m taking the fight straight to the Emperor. I\u2019m done with bleeding the Empire slowly. I want to remove its head with a single blow.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d you comment.\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Mathers says. \u201cBut a lot easier with a high ranking officer at your disposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do I come into all of this? There are plenty of swords to hire.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlattery won\u2019t help. I have a realistic notion of my skill and its relation to others. I have never faced a superior opponent since leaving the monastery, but that does not mean superior opponents don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned the monastery. Don\u2019t you want to know how I learned of your survival?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not survive alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know. The girl had no small part in the matter, but it\u2019s ultimately you I am, and the Empire, is interested in.\"\n\n\u201cWhy? Kassi and I are equals.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa-ha! The monks never told you, did they? Oh this is just too good. How do you think you arrived there in the first place?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a child, I told myself loving parents gave me up in hopes for a better life, though even then, I knew that was a lie. I knew I was different from the other kids. The monks never shared the details, and I have no memory before arriving. My current state leads my actions, my past\u2019s details are less important.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t read the reports myself, I think you would make a solid argument. Your past is more important than you assume.\u201d Her face darkens. \u201c--because it\u2019s what haunts you now.\u201d\n\nMathers\u2019 words paralyze you. Your mind wanders to your night in Estabrook, to your nightmare.\n\n\u201cWhat report?\u201d you manage to ask.\n\n\u201cKid, you look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost, although this is you, so that wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched.

His soldiers run through the capital city, slaughtering men and performing acts on women, desperately wishing for the blade instead of the next soldier in line. Ragar\u2019s black hair flows in the wind. His view atop the wyvern gives him full vantage over the battle. Laughing, he casts another fireball into a nearby church tower. The ringing bell is silenced in a short burst of collapsing stone and metal. Straight ahead of him, though masked by the burning city\u2019s smoke, lies the stronghold tower of King Osborne.\n\nEven a mere glance at the king\u2019s stronghold builds rage inside Ragar.\n\nHE BETRAYED ME!\n\n\u201cHe betrayed me,\u201d Ragar lifelessly speaks. His voice is drowned out by the battle below. With a snarl, he guides the wyvern towards the tower. He doesn\u2019t care that the act will put him into enemy lines, far beyond the reach of his army. Osborne is near and Ragar will have his revenge.\n\nArrows and arcane projectiles fly through the air at him. They dissolve into the barrier of dark magic Ragar maintains around the winged beast. Ragar allows them to keep firing into his shield. As he nears a siege weapon, he unleashes the stored energy burying the weapon and surrounding soldiers in a heap of rubble.\n\nTerror begins to spread in the minds of the defending soldiers. Ragar the Unbroken is here!\n\nRagar has little trouble navigating to the throne room. The pitiful soldiers tasked with defending their king fall at a simple wave of Ragar\u2019s hand. He raises their dead bodies up in hopes they might offer better protection to their new master. Ragar boldly walks the long pathway to the throne\u2019s steps. His newly raised soldiers escort him.\n\nKing Osborne solemnly sits on the throne. The golden crown sitting on his wavy brown hair suddenly feels a lot heavier. Beside him sits the queen and his daughter, Catherine.\n\n\u201cHas your quest for power satisfied you, Ragar?\u201d the King projects into the merely empty throne room. His words give a slight echo, a result of the room's emptiness.\n\nI WILL NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL YOU\u2019RE DEAD\n\n\u201cI will not be satisfied until you\u2019re dead,\u201d Ragar answers.\n\nThe Queen rises from her seat in anger. \u201cRagar! Enough of this! You have betrayed your family, your own flesh and blood. If I had known what you would grow up to be, I would have ended your life in childbirth.\u201d\n\nRagar utters a contemptuous laugh. \u201cNo, you would not. The true evil sits beside you. None of you have the strength to grasp the power our blood offers, even more so with the ritual I\u2019ve discovered; the same one you banished me for.\u201d\n\nKing Osborne interjects. \u201cYou gave me no choice, son. You\u2019re lucky to have received banishment and not execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough of this. Now you die,\u201d Ragar spits.\n\nWith a wave of his hand, the undead escort charges the throne\u2019s steps. Osborne grips his two-handed hammer in anticipation. Holy magic fires from the Queen\u2019s open palm. The blast burns right through the undead soldiers. The remaining few receive fatal blows from the King\u2019s mighty hammer.\n\nRagar expected the outcome. The undead soldiers provided him with enough time to finish casting the spell. The throne room fills with banshee screams. The royal family is forced to cover their ears. An invisible grip pulls the Queen towards Ragar. The grip begins to compress, the Queen cries out in pain. Ragar laughs as the Queen\u2019s bones snap under the magical compression. At the top of the throne's steps, Catherine screams. As the Queen's body drops lifelessly to the floor, Ragar turns to the other members of the royal family.\n\n\u201cAnd to think, your, our, divine blood couldn\u2019t save her...\u201d\n\nIT WON\u2019T SAVE YOU EITHER\n\n\u201c...It won\u2019t save you either.\u201d\n\nKing Osborne charges down the steps with his hammer raised overhead. His sudden assault catches Ragar off guard; he is barely able to raise a defensive shield to absorb the blow. The powerful strike sends Ragar flying across the floor. Holy sigils on the hammer emit a golden glow. The divine power of the artifact surges through Osborne, and his eyes emit the same glow.\n\nThe power inside Ragar, the one he devoted his soul to, wills him to roll to his left. The hammer crushes through the floor in the place Ragar just was. Snarling as if a rabid dog, he springs to his feet. Ragar fires several shadow bolts towards Osborne. The King is able to defend against each one.\n\nSuddenly a blade pierces out the front of Osborne\u2019s throat in a burst of red. The King drops clutching his wound. The undead Queen stands over the body of her fallen husband. Shadowy wisps begin to form in her eye and mouth holes. Ragar smiles at his mother. The seed of black magic he planted have begun to grow. The igniting agent: her death. His eyes draw to young Princess Catherine.\n\nWE MUST PRESERVE THE DIVINE BLOODLINE\n\nRagar hesitates a moment, and then surrenders his will to the dark power within.\n\n\u201cWe must preserve the divine bloodline.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "...", "result": "\u201cWhat does the story have to do with me?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be that thick-headed.

Yuri stands with you as well. It turns out Vishal\u2019s man is actually Mathers\u2019.\n\nThe deadly blow Mathers discussed with you took several years of planning. There was the matter of getting people staffed as royal servants as well as scouting the layout of the fortress. Every tiny detail of the assassination was planned out ahead of time. Things seemingly insignificant, such as learning the names of each stablehand, were addressed. Mathers ran a tight ship and didn\u2019t want any weak links.\n\nYou exit the tavern\u2019s basement to stroll to your home. You and Kassi moved to the Empire\u2019s capital city almost immediately after joining Mathers. There, you posed as newly weds in search of a better life. In fact, your cover included getting a job at a nearby fencing school. Mathers warned that someone is always watching in the capital city. The Empire keeps close tabs on its citizens that reside close to the Emperor, not that anyone could visit him. The Emperor never leaves the fortress, and the only way in is to be invited. It just so happens, you\u2019ve received such an invitation.\n\nKassi walks by your side, and you put an arm around her for appearances. The capital city is far cleaner than Searing Rock.

There\u2019s limited amount of space in the capital city, and most buildings are built with such proportions. The first floor consists of a single room with a winding staircase that leads to the upper. As soon as you enter the doorway, you feel a cold chill run down your spine. You sense a presence you have not felt since the monastery.\n\n\u201cSomething wrong?

Hanging in front of a changing curtain is two magnificently designed outfits. The clothes are made with the current fashion design, though a little too tight in your opinion. You remove your clothes to clean up for the occasion. When you finish, you gaze in the mirror at the unrecognizable figure looking back.\n\nThough still on the young side, your face has long matured into manhood. Your clean-shaven face would require a razor\u2019s attention if it were to keep its form this time tomorrow. Your tailored coat hangs to your mid-thighs, its black material matching the pants. You adjust the light scarf around your throat that seems to melt into the coat.\n\n\u201cAre you really that uncomfortable? I\u2019ve never seen you fidget that much, even including that time we spent three days hiding in the treetops of Langly Forest.\u201d\n\nYou turn to see Kassi. Her hair is back to bright blonde. The few golden strands that have purposely escaped her hair tie hang loosely on her bare shoulders. Her raven-colored dress hugs tightly against her athletic, but still womanly, body.\n\n\u201cYou look\u2026\u201d you begin to say before blanking on the words.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d she smiles.\n\nShe picks up a gold-tipped cane and hands it to you.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget this.

Turning to you, he adds, \u201cCouldn\u2019t find a larger size jacket?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy jackets are always tight around the shoulders,\u201d you retort mentioning to his belly. \u201cWhile yours tend to be tight around the stomach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa-ha!

I didn\u2019t think you owned anything besides that old robe of yours.\u201d\n\nYou turn to see Priscilla, the daughter of General Hathis, one of your students. Her full-bodied red curls flow lightlessly down her back. In contrast to the white dress below, her sanguine hair looks even brighter. Your eyes are drawn to the gold rapier at her hip.\n\n\u201cSurprised you managed to bring that needle of yours,\u201d you say. \u201cI should have brought mine too.\u201d\n\nShe smiles. \u201cBeing my father\u2019s daughter has certain benefits. Besides, any guard who would confiscate \u2018Verna\u2019 knows I would report them for being too handsy, a quick way to an early retirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps next lesson we should go over proper sword naming technique.\u201d\n\nShe attempts to give you a playful shove on the shoulder, but instinctively, you parry the blow aside. The guard tasked with protecting Pricilla, her father\u2019s man if you had to guess, warningly slides his hand to his sword hilt.\n\n\u201cHa! No wonder you\u2019re the top instructor in the Empire,\u201d Priscilla says.\n\n\u201cThe Empire?\u201d Kassi inputs. \u201cAs if my husband needs a bolster to his ego.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you two,\u201d you answer. \u201cA swordmaster knows when he faces superior opponents.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Priscilla says. \u201cI\u2019m sure the lovely people here would enjoy the spectacle of a sword demonstration.

The gathering crowd whispers among themselves in excitement at the upcoming display of combat.\n\n\u201cSo much for not drawing attention,\u201d Kassi whispers in your ear.\n\nYou shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my cover,\u201d you whisper back.\n\nYou remove your coat and roll up the sleeves of your tunic. As you walk to the center of the gathered circle of people, you loosen up your shoulders. Man, it feels good to be out of that damn jacket. You give the cane a few twirls to test the weight and balance. The crowd \u201coohs\u201d at the simple motion. The slow, stringed music shifts to an upbeat tune with consistent low notes setting the tone for the fast and loose melody.\n\nA barefoot Priscilla meets you in the center with the golden rapier drawn. She acts like she\u2019s about to say something, and then suddenly lunges forward with the rapier in attack position. You easily knock the blade aside and step back out of range. The cane, while not extremely heavy, is definitely a lot slower to wield than a rapier. You take a mental note to adjust for the speed difference.\n\nUsing more theatrics than you\u2019re accustomed to, you twirl the cane and spin into your attack. You weave high, jumping overhead, striking with long and low thrusts. The crowd seems pleased and a cheer rises from the acrobatic movements. You\u2019re acutely aware of Priscilla\u2019s ability and don\u2019t give her more than she can handle. Before each strike, you subtly give a \u201ctell,\u201d so Priscilla is alerted to your attack.\n\nOne heavy thrust removes a large section of the metal from your cane. The shiny piece falls to the ground with a clatter. You and Priscilla stop for a moment at the broken section. In the break in action, the chilling presence once again falls over you. For a brief moment, you see the flash of a skull behind Pricilla\u2019s face. The image sticks in your mind for several blinks after.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay for that!\u201d she shouts and begins another assault.", "action_results": [{"action": "End the demonstration", "result": "Wanting to finish the show quickly, you wait for Priscilla\u2019s next attack.

The guard assigned to Priscilla, steps into the center with his sword out. At the last moment, you shoot your leg out and squat to ground level. Priscilla lands harmlessly in your grasp, your hand supporting her upper body and your leg, the lower. She sits, unmoving, as her mind tries to understand how she ended up in that position.\n\nA big smile stretches across her face. \u201cI told you he was the best!\u201d she shouts to the crowd. Her guard relaxes his sword. You help Priscilla to her feet and bow to the crowd.

His long flowing green hair and smoothly-shaved skin gives a youthful appearance, yet his eyes look more mature. The guards at either side stand stoic, their polaxes at the ready.\n\n\u201cYes? Can I help you?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor summons you for a personal audience,\u201d the man says with an air of superiority.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor? What does he want with me?\u201d you ask. You\u2019re not used to being caught off guard, and the man\u2019s statement is not expected.\n\n\u201cI am not here to answer your questions. Only to bring to His Majesty. Come along now. Alone.\u201d\n\nYou give Kassi a shrug and follow behind the green-haired man. The guards \u201csubtly\u201d arrange themselves to your front and back. The man leads you up a massive, winding staircase of red carpet. Gold lines the banisters. You continue down a narrow hallway, stopping at four different checkpoints for clearance. The man keeps the same posture throughout: shoulders back and chin high. The personnel at the checkpoints seem to recognize the man, but still thoroughly search him the same as you. Your cane is confiscated at the first point. You reach a series of steel double-doors and the man motions for you to enter. The green-haired man and guards stay outside.\n\nYou enter the room and take in your surroundings. It's mostly open-spaced, though on the narrow side. Two balconies run on either side, and you can see a series of bookcases on the floor above. White marble fills the ground. At the far end, you can see a spherical object on what appears to be a shrine. Behind it, a small staircase on either side lead to a viewing platform. You can\u2019t see out the windows from your position, but you can guess the half-circle of clear glass gives a view over the entire capital. A figure stands at the viewing platform gazing out, his back turned towards you.\n\nThe room is silent, but for your echoing footsteps as you approach the platform.\n\n\u201cDo you know why you\u2019re here, Swordmaster?\u201d the figure says. His voice is deep, though not in an aggressive manner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here at the invitation of my Emperor,\u201d you reply.\n\n\u201cAnd you do not have an ulterior motive?\u201d\n\nFor the second time tonight, you\u2019re caught off-guard. \u201cI do admit, attending tonight is beneficial to my school, not everyone can be taught the art of swordplay from a master in favorable grace with His Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Emperor says. He turns around and you catch sight of him for the first time. Long strands of black hair hang well below his shoulders. His eyes are green, something you\u2019ve never seen with an individual with black hair. His face is sharp as if his attention is kept unwavering on the object of his choosing.

You can tell the difference between a bluff in an attempt to gather information and a man speaking the truth. You deal with it routinely in swordplay; there\u2019s always a slight sign of a man feinting. It may be subtle, but it\u2019s there and you\u2019ve trained your whole life to spot it. There\u2019s no mistaking it, the Emperor knows about the assassination attempt.\n\n\u201cThen why are we still alive?\u201d you ask. \u201cThe obvious action would be to execute us, publically, to dissuade future attempts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that can be arranged later.

Their orders were to capture Aeric\u2019s throne. Instead, they rampaged throughout the land, slaughtering all in their way. I had to order a battalion of my own to put them down. I\u2019m sure you find comfort in knowing the monastery\u2019s attackers were all executed. Not quickly, I might add.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all your own.

The monks provided their finest warrior to Aeric each year after the Grand Melee. The monks were actively providing King Aeric with elite soldiers. In other words, they were supplying a nation in opposition to the Empire with troops.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your silence as agreement,\u201d the Emperor says. \u201cThe monks were in opposition to the Empire. I\u2019m not justifying the action of those animals, but I\u2019m simply stating true neutrality is a false ideal. You\u2019re either an ally or enemy, which brings me to you. I know what hunts you. I know the nightmares you\u2019ve been having.

Give up your futile vendetta against the Empire and let\u2019s raise the curse that follows our family.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, the double-doors swing open, and a blood-stained Mathers enters the room. The white on her waitress outfit is turned red. Followed behind her is the green-haired man and Kassi, both armed and just as stained. The trio walks up next to you and faces the Emperor leaving behind a trail of red footprints.\n\n\u201cThank you, Swordmaster, for distracting the Emperor\u2019s watchful gaze long enough,\u201d Mathers says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have made it through without. Heh, seems you overestimated whose inner circle was compromised.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll not survive this night.

The Emperor\u2019s is not the embodiment of evil you imagined him to be. Plus, he seems to know about your past. He might be the only one who can answer the questions of your past.\n\nYou look back to the skirmish in front of you. The Emperor is slowly losing momentum. You can tell he realizes it too. He draws on arcane energy, and sends a blast of pulsing dark power towards Kassi. The blow knocks her sprawling across the room.

Seth takes the offensive first, weaving his twin swords into attack position. He slides underneath a swipe from the wyvern\u2019s tail.

Parry, feint, strike. Just like the others, they fall to the three-pronged maneuver.\n\nDanger.\n\nKassi senses it -- a moment too late. The greatsword swings at her undefended back. Like a thundercrack, it meets the dual defense of Seth\u2019s blades. In the distance, the wheelcrank of the inner gate starts to lower. Crank. The sound draws the attention of Aeric\u2019s soldiers. They retreat towards the gate in fear of being locked out. Crank. Kassi regroups and lets loose a barrage of attacks at the wyvern rider.

Finally, the same vine-like grip wraps around Dodgey\u2019s neck. The big man drops his weapon and shield and grabs at his throat. Mordecai activates his weapon once again to change form. The whip, now rigid, births a crescent moon blade at the end. The sharp edge of the scythe rests on Dodgey\u2019s nape.

It\u2019s distressed, like a wolf caught in a snare.\n\nIt speaks for the first time, and through its twisted, muffled voice, it\u2019s apparent it\u2019s a woman\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cIronic\u2026you speak of dark magic with distaste, while housing the vilest within yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d you answer. \u201cAlthough I do not allow it to control me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try to resist, but the Unbroken bloodline eventually will reveal itself. I\u2019m sure it has already.\u201d\n\nKassi joins in. \u201cThe only darkness affecting him is you. I witnessed the nightmares brought upon by your hunt. My respect is all but lost for this one, but I\u2019d still not see you possess him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa! I\u2019m not looking to possess him, girl. I\u2019m looking to end the bloodline\u2026even if they are my descendants as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess Catherine?\u201d Mordecai asks, in full recognition of Ragar\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so you sold your soul for vengeance, trading one evil for another. Your tormenting ends now, Catherine,\u201d you say, raising your sword.\n\nYou drive the point through King Aeric\u2019s face, piercing the shade underneath. The shade, Catherine, shrieks, filling the throne room with sharp noise. A black hole appears at her torso, drawing in streaks of black mist and wisps. The shadowy form of Catherine fills the hole for a moment, and then bursts into an explosion of light. Upon the light\u2019s subsiding, King Aeric\u2019s mutilated body lays bound by the whip, the shade nowhere to be seen.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t forgive you,\u201d Kassi breaks the silence. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through, you just\u2026abandoned us, abandoned me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry it came to that,\u201d you softly answer. \u201cThe Emperor isn\u2019t an evil man. We\u2019re bound, he and I. We share the same bloodline. My episodes were getting worse. You might have been the victim of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must not know me well at all if you think you\u2019d ever beat me.\u201d\n\n\u201cKass, I\u2019m serious. Innocent people around me die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so innocent.\u201d\n\nMordecai walks up to you and places a hand on your shoulder, reassuringly that he\u2019s not a threat. \u201cEven I, my king\u2019s most trusted advisor, did not see he was possessed by a spirit. You have my gratitude. I see the monastery has trained you well. Glad to see it was vigilant until the end, it certainly was during my days there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were the king\u2019s emissary once?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cEmissary? I won the honor to serve King Aeric through the Grand Melee. All who wear the dark red robe were once from the monastery. Speaking of which, where\u2019s Seth?\u201d Mordecai asks.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t make it,\u201d Kassi answers.\n\n\u201cDamned fool,\u201d Mordecai whispers to himself. \u201cGo, Swordmaster. There is nothing left for you here. The day is won, the fortress is yours. Report the King\u2019s death to your Emperor.\n\n\u201cGet yourselves to safety,\u201d you answer pulling two small objects from your cloak. \u201cThese seals will allow you to pass through the Imperial army unharmed.\u201d\n\nKassi offers a small laugh, a sign of the woman you once knew. \u201cPlease. Like we need your trinkets to move unhindered. Still though, the thought is well-received.\u201d She takes the seals anyway. \u201cSo, I guess this is it,\u201d she adds on.\n\nYou clasp her hand. \u201cI guess so. Be safe, Kass.\u201d\n\nShe looks into your eyes, gauging your intentions. For a brief moment, you flash back to the monastery and remember the passionate, bright blonde-haired girl who trained you. The girl who feigns lack of emotion to appear strong. The girl who is the perfect embodiment of the balance between discipline and joy. The girl who was the only one you could share personal thoughts with. The girl you turned your back on.\n\nYou release her hand and gently squeeze her arm. \u201cGo now.\u201d\n\nKassi and Mordecai leave together, while Captain Wren and Big Sue silently watch. They do not vocalize their protest, though you can tell it doesn\u2019t sit well with them.\n\nCaptain Wren approaches you. \u201cAre you sure we should just let them leave? They are the enemy, after all.\u201d\n\nYour eyes meet his. \u201cIf they were truly your enemy, you would not be breathing right now.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "In reality...", "result": "Red. Your entire vision is filled with red. A driving, insatiable force drives you forward. You can\u2019t stop, nor do you want to. The weak, the undevoted, the blasphemers. They all will pay for their wrong. Like separating wheat from the chaff, you will forge a better society, one that is not unencumbered by the weak-willed and naysayers.\n\nEach cleansing blow from your sword brings you one step closer. Each foreigner that falls brings a surge of energy and a curved smile to your lips. Your blade eats into flesh and drinks the flowing blood. \u201cMore!\u201d it screams, and you satisfy its desire. You do not see faces, you do not hear their words. You simply kill. You kill for the Empire. You kill to cull the weak. You kill because it\u2019s all that you know.\n\nThe bloodlust gone, the voice gives back control, and you see the result of your actions. You\u2019re in the center of a red pool, your hands stained the same. The blood is warm, like clutching a soothing cup of tea between both palms.\n\nThen you see her.\n\nShe lays still as if asleep, one arm crossed at her chest, the other stretched out beside her body. Her bright blonde hair, the color that reminds you of sunlight, is dyed dark crimson. The two slashes at her throat are like a jagged, sanguine necklace. The others, Mordecai, Sue, Wren, lay next to her. You hardly notice them; your gaze is on Kassi, unmoving, unable to look away.\n\nYour stoic, expressionless demeanor vanishes as your screams fill the empty throne room. Just as suddenly as it disappeared, you regather your blank, emotionless demeanor. You close your eyes and focus on your training, using long, drawn-out breathing patterns to calm your heart rate. When you reopen your eyes, the Emperor stands before you.\n\n\u201cA great victory has been won this day,\u201d he comments.\n\n\u201cWhat of the cure?\u201d you ask. \u201cHave you uncovered the secrets to suppressing the voice?\u201d\n\nThe Emperor eyes the mess of bodies on the floor. \u201cNot yet, I\u2019m afraid. The collection of books here are not nearly as extensive as my spies informed. Still, I will have my top researchers work on it. There is one ritual that might work, but it involves giving in to the voice\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNot going to happen. I\u2019ve been controlled by it for too long. I\u2019ll not willingly surrender to it, even at the slight chance of eradicating it forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that,\u201d The Emperor says. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way. I\u2019ve had my men prepare a room for you here. Come, rest up. Tomorrow brings the promise of greater glories.\u201d\n\nThe Emperor motions to a man standing near the entryway. With a bow, he approaches.\n\n\u201cFollow me, Commander. I\u2019ll show you your quarters,\u201d the youthful man speaks. You can tell by his clean appearance, he did not take part in the battle.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say. \u201cI need to bury her. I need to bury Kassi near the monastery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d The Emperor replies. \u201cI will arrange a battalion to accompany.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect, that would dishonor her memory. She fought the Empire to her last breath,\u201d you say with full clarity of the statement. While you are technically a part of the Empire, an Imperial force near the monastery would be symbolic of the initial attack, something you\u2019d rather not think about while putting Kassi to rest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll not allow a high-ranking member of my army travel alone, especially in newly conquered territory. The threat is too high. You will go with a battalion or not at all,\u201d The Emperor adamantly states.", "action_results": [{"action": "Travel with the battalion", "result": "\u201cAs you wish, my Emperor,\u201d you say. \u201cWe\u2019ll depart right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll instruct my men to meet you at first light,\u201d the Emperor replies, turning to leave.\n\n\u201cWith respect, I don\u2019t think you understood me,\u201d you say. \u201cWhen I say depart right away, I mean now. There is only a short window while corpses still look like themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand, my friend. I have important matters to attend here, otherwise I\u2019d go with you. I\u2019ll make the arrangements.\u201d\n\nYou wade through the puddle of blood to Kassi\u2019s corpse. Her lifeless eyes stare, endlessly, towards the octopus-shaped chandelier above. Softly, you shut them closed and scoop her underneath your arms. You silently mourn the loss of Mordecai. He was your enemy, a damned tough one, but more importantly, he came from the monastery. In another life perhaps you would have been close. You shake the thought from your mind as quickly as it appears. There\u2019s no use in dwelling on the past. The past is dead. All that matters is the present moment.\n\nYou arrive at the front gates of Aeric\u2019s castle still holding Kassi. The path is littered with fallen soldiers, their victors fighting over treasures of the dead. It\u2019s not uncommon for fights to break out over bounty, at least among the lower ranked members.\n\n\u201cI see some things remain the same.\u201d\n\nThe ragged voice comes from above you. You look up to see a man bound to the archway almost directly on top of you. His arms are held out like a \u201cT\u201d wrapped and suspended by rope. The remainder of his naked body is exposed for all to see. At his belly, three arrows. You count the broken shafts of four more scattered in his body. He coughs, creating a crimson waterfall down the front of his bare torso. After a moment, you recognize his face. He\u2019s hardly aged since last you saw him. Seth.\n\n\u201cWho did this?\u201d you scream to the nearby Imperial soldiers. One of them offers a shrug, the rest simply pretend not to hear. You stomp towards the one who shrugged, who is likely regretting the gesture. \u201cI won\u2019t ask again.\"\n\nThe man nervously avoids your direct gaze. At first it\u2019s unfocused, but then it becomes fixed, targeted at someone. You turn to see a pair of horns mounted on a helm, black armor beneath. A dull, monotone voice speaks through the helm.\n\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\nYou let the nervous soldier leave. He takes off quickly, not looking back once.\n\n\u201cI know who you are -- and what you did,\u201d you state.\n\n\u201cDresden, at your command. People die in war,\u201d the voice beneath the helm answers.\n\n\u201cLike that?\u201d you point up towards Seth.\n\n\u201cAll kinds of ways.\u201d\n\nSeth coughs again, distracting you from the conversation. \u201cPay her my respects, will you, kid?\u201d\n\nYou nod, a reply absent from your lips. Turning towards the horned helm you ask knowing the answer, \u201cAnd I suppose you are to accompany me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is correct, Commander. No one knows these mountains like I do.\u201d\n\nYou depart for the monastery ruins along with Dresden. The image of Seth bound, and slowly dying, burns in your memory. Several times during the journey, you notice the reigns to the cart unconsciously wrapped around your hands in a bind. You lead the battalion from the head, Dresden follows overhead by wyvern. You don\u2019t turn to look upon the coffin at the back of your cart. You want to, but don\u2019t, and keep your eyes forward on the path, hoping your physical metaphor will transition to the non-physical. You don\u2019t speak to the Imperial soldiers. Not that you really ever did, but this journey more than others you desire silence.\n\nNow that you\u2019re here, in this moment, were your actions worth it? Your training, your discipline deters such thought, and yet, you brute force through the mental barriers and habits accrued over a lifetime of practicing. Your oldest friend is dead, and the thing that originally separated you, was the exact cause of her death.\n\nPerhaps, events are prewritten. Perhaps, you cannot escape destiny. A shiver runs down your spine as you connect with the thought that your destiny is intertwined with murdering your loved ones. No, there has to be more at work. Call it coincidence, bad luck, whatever -- anything that\u2019s not a pre-arranged set of circumstances. You are in control of your fate, of your destiny. You have to believe that\u2019s the case.\n\nThree days later you arrive. At first a black dot in the distance, the ruins slowly begin to take shape as you draw closer. The monastery had certainly seen better days. While the place is mostly intact, signs of decay can be seen, even from afar. It\u2019s as if the nature surrounding the structure is steadily swallowing the monastery from the lack of upkeep. Still, decades later, you don\u2019t see any sign of bandits or people taking shelter within the place, a testament to the monastery\u2019s reputation.\n\nPart of you wants to order the Imperial troops to camp outside. Their presence near the monastery is bad enough, and what are you supposed to do? Welcome the same invading force to take refuge in the sacred place of your childhood? Such thoughts are born of attachment. The monks taught against such behavior. You don\u2019t like it, but you allow the Imperial soldiers to use the shelter that the monastery provides.\n\nAlone, you take Kassi to a nearby mountainside, the same place where the Grand Melee took place. You travel up the rocky slope to the section where the mountain jettisons out, flat, as if cleanly cut. You briefly admire the view from the high vantage point and begin collecting rocks. The view is exactly as you remember it. Your life is drastically different decades later, while the world in front of you remains the same. Once you\u2019ve gathered enough, you place them in a pile where the lifted stage once stood. You gently lay Kassi in the center and begin building the stone grave.\n\n\u201cWas everything in vain?\u201d you softly speak to Kassi. \u201cWas this moment truly unavoidable?\u201d\n\nShe remains silent.\n\n\u201cI contemplate each action before deciding, weighing each potential outcome against another. We were taught to accept our position, no matter what. We were taught to let go of any attachments as our selves, our true selves, are not dependent on things or people. You were always much better than me.\u201d\n\nThe grave complete, you take a step back and kneel before the rocks, your hips on your heels and hands in your lap. Your eyes flutter shut and you take long, drawn-out breaths. Each inhale, you feel your stomach, ribs, and chest expand, followed by the retraction of exhalation. The rocky ground digs into your knees, creating a dull pain. Ignoring it, you continue to meditate observing the thought stream that flows in your mind.\n\nThe wind softly blows, drawing your awareness to the world around you. The breeze whispers at your nape, promising to remain consistent. She\u2019s chaotic, seemingly random at times, but steady and steadfast to her word, much like Kassi.\n\nA bird flies overhead, wings outstretched using the wind for guidance. It does not weigh its actions; it follows its instinct. No ideology or self-story holds it down. It simply exists. Kassi to rest, you journey back down the mountainside.\n\nTheir drunken cries ring into the night air, animalistic, more than the woodland creatures you just crossed paths with. The ruins, lit by bonfires built from monastery remains, warm and encourage the primal behavior. You stop at the nearest fire, staring at the six soldiers huddled around.\n\n\u201cCommander! We discovered a sizeable amount of mead in the cellar. Join us in celebrating the Emperor\u2019s victory.\u201d\n\nThe young-faced soldier offering the invitation holds a cup out for you. Not much more than a boy, it\u2019s not surprising the mead is affecting him so.", "action_results": [{"action": "Cut them down", "result": "It\u2019s not out of hate. You don\u2019t harbor ill-will towards the Imperial soldiers -- they\u2019re on your side, after all. It\u2019s a matter of respect and discipline to the highest degree, both of which the soldiers lack. Just as the bird flying overhead, you do not contemplate. You simply do as you must, what you\u2019re born, what you\u2019re destined to do.\n\nKassi\u2019s sword has a familiar feel, as if the two of you are clasping hands. You offer her memory a funeral of Imperial blood. Before the drunken soldiers can react, you arc Kassi\u2019s blade through the air, showering the earth with blood and mead. The drink slows them down, pitifully so. The few that manage to unsheathe their weapons are met with your tribute to Kassi. Parry, feint, strike! You knew Kassi\u2019s movements almost as well as the woman herself and channel her fighting spirit to guide your blade.\n\nShouts echo from other fires as the soldiers notice your actions. An alarm bell rings, signaling the Imperial soldiers into mobilization. The flames at your back, you eye the soldier\u2019s preparation. They\u2019re undisciplined, unprepared. You stand a dark figure framed by the fire, a sword in either hand. Two blades have never been your style, but tonight the union between Kassi\u2019s and your sword would be complete, sealed by the death of Empire soldiers. You do what you could not forty years earlier. You smite the invading army from the monastery.\n\nDresden appears in simple chain mail, his normal plate armor too bulky to don for the sudden attack. You almost don\u2019t recognize the man, besides the greatsword at his back. His face is scarred as if a burn victim, hairless save for two thin eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt seems the Emperor\u2019s dog isn\u2019t as well-trained as we were meant to believe. No matter, I have strict orders to put you down if this place brought out old habits,\u201d he speaks, unmuffled by the absence of his normal helm.\n\n\u201cDo what you must. It\u2019s the only thing a man can do,\u201d you reply.\n\nDresden\u2019s greatsword swings through the air, the weight sending off low-pitched tones. You redirect the greatsword, not wanting to directly block the blows. The powerful weapon would easily eat through your arm strength if met head-on. You allow your training to guide you. The flow takes over and the world slows down around you. Each swing of the greatsword appears labored as if the wielder is out of breath. Things appear with clarity. The present moment, all that matters, is before you. Plans of the future, past failures: they don\u2019t matter. Your entire reality becomes the current battle.\n\nYour sword finds the back of Dresden\u2019s hamstring, dropping him to one knee. For emphasis, you slice open the other. He kneels before you, using the greatsword to prop himself up.\n\n\u201cEnd it, dog. You cannot escape the Empire\u2019s grasp. Soon you will join me in the afterlife. The Emperor will make sure of that,\u201d Dresden speaks through ragged breath.\n\n\u201cPerhaps so. Whatever fate has in store for me is irrefutable, whether that\u2019s my death or otherwise. One thing\u2019s for certain, your journey ends here,\u201d you answer.\n\nThe tip of Kassi\u2019s sword enters through the front and exits the back of Dresden\u2019s throat. The strength gone from his limbs, Dresden falls forward and collapses face first into the dirt. Chained in the distance, Dresden\u2019s wyvern cries out. The beast roars over the battle-readying Imperial troops.\n\nYou approach the beast, eyeing the chain at its neck tied to a tree trunk. It returns the stare with yellow lizard eyes, sensing your intention and threat presence. Using Dresden\u2019s greatsword you break the chain holding the wyvern in place. Instantly, it flaps its wings and jumps into the air. Now free, it heads in the direction of the surrounding mountains.

It\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever intentionally misled the Emperor. In fact, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve intentionally misled anyone for years. You take pride in your practice, and that practice includes being direct and forthright. Still, this is a special circumstance. Even considering it \u201cspecial\u201d puts a damper on your mood. It\u2019s not special, your fucking world is turned upside down.\n\nYou allow an Imperial soldier to lead to you the quarters provided. It\u2019s not as extravagant as the Emperor\u2019s tent, but it serves its purpose. It wouldn\u2019t be your place to dwell in a living arrangement that\u2019s nicer than your leader's anyway. The room itself is long and narrow. The ceiling is arced like a cabin would be, two sloping walls meeting at the center. Earth tones line the interior, nothing is fancy, but serves its purpose to the highest degree.\n\nYou drop your things near the heavy wool-skinned bed and kneel on the floor beside it. Sitting on your heels, you close your eyes and meditate on your upcoming actions. The Emperor wouldn\u2019t be happy. Perhaps he would understand. You doubt it. Disobeying is disobeying, despite your place in the Empire. Once the light shining through the window fades to black, you prepare for the journey.\n\nYou pack light, taking only what is necessary. Without the aid of Imperial transport, you\u2019ll need as little as possible weighing you down. Your sword is hung, familiar, on your hip. On it\u2019s opposite, you hang Kassi\u2019s sword. Two swords at your side, something you\u2019ve never preferred, feels right in this moment. The blade was an important part of Kassi, her most prized possession. Having it at your side is a good reminder of your reasons for going against the Emperor. It\u2019s almost like having her at your side. Almost.\n\nThe horse and cart is already prepared for the journey. You made sure to have it prepared the night before. A lone Imperial soldier stands guard at the stables, light for an Imperial patrol, but the rest of the \u201con duty\u201d guards are most likely celebrating the victory.\n\n\u201cEvening, Commander. Thought that was you. What can I do for you?\u201d the baby-faced soldier speaks in to the night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ostus, right?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d he beams. Adding on with a salute, he says, \u201cFredrick Ostus at your command.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good soldier, Ostus. But you are needed elsewhere tonight. There are more high priority places to watch,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cMaybe so\u2026although Dresden himself gave me this position. I can\u2019t disobey a superior, even if there is something better to do. It\u2019s how we stay functioning,\u201d Ostus shrugs. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019d rather be at with the boys celebrating. Don\u2019t tell Dresden that, but my job is to watch the stables and prevent any disorderly conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Ostus. I hope when you wake, you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive you for wh--\"\n\nBefore Ostus finishes his sentence, the hilt of your sword smashes against his temple. His body crumples limply to the ground. You prop his body in a comfortable position, and take the reigns of the cart. It\u2019s a small cart, only driven by a single horse, but it\u2019s more than enough to lug the contents in the back. You signal the horse forward and ride off into the night.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue on", "result": "They arrived sooner than you expected. At first they appeared as birds flying in the distance. Black wings steadily gaining on your location, and that\u2019s when you recognize the \u201cbirds.\u201d Wyverns, three of them. Your traveling conditions offered almost no ability to conceal your path. It wasn\u2019t hard for them to find you \u2014 it\u2019s their hastiness that surprised you.\n\nTwo of the winged beasts land at your front and one directly behind you. The trail is narrow, leaving almost no room for you to veer off to avoid their pursuit. Thick trees lie of either side, preventing the cart from being able to travel through. The first thing you notice is the horned helm. Sending flashbacks to your childhood, the day of the massacre, you instantly recognize the figure. The greatsword at his back, the one that stole the life of the Grandmaster hangs at the figure\u2019s back. Beneath the helm is a dark set of plate armor.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor had a feeling you might betray him,\u201d the voice behind the horns rings into the cool morning air.\n\n\u201cThere is no betrayal, only what must be done.

I will rejoin the Emperor after a proper burial has taken place,\u201d you say. \u201cYour intentions are no secret. The way you\u2019ve positioned yourselves speak to only one outcome. Battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cNewly conquered territories always are dangerous. There\u2019s no telling how the locals might react. Like, for say, they might set upon a lone Imperial member. It\u2019s dangerous to be alone, even for a well renown warrior such as yourself.\u201d\n\nYour hands let go of the reigns and their grip is replaced with sword handles. \u201cThen let us not delay. I have a funeral to attend to. Seems I\u2019ll need to attend to yours first.\u201d\n\nWith a snarl, the horned man, Dresden, attacks. His greatsword swings through the air with a low hum. The other two riders follow closely behind, their spears at the ready. You abandon the cart for open ground. The first wyvern dives down with frightening speed. It\u2019s only through your lifetime training that you\u2019re able to narrowly dodge the attack. A little luck never hurts too. You realize in the open, you\u2019re too exposed, and likely would be run down in a matter of time. Once again moving ground, you trade the open road for the surrounding forest neutralizing their aerial assault. Three men follow you into the thicket.\n\nLight is minimal in the forest. Overgrown branches, roots, and stumps fill your vision. It\u2019s hard to navigate through, even in your light armor. Going through with heavy plate would be a nightmare. You allow the environment to influence your battle plans, familiarizing yourself with the area. Long lunging and high overhead sweeping techniques would have to be discarded due to the overgrowth.\n\nHeavy footsteps draw closer. You lie in wait. They don\u2019t see you, not at first. In the open road you were their prey. Here you are the predator. Here, you will hunt them down. The first spear wielder doesn\u2019t even have time to react. From behind, you silently sneak up. Kassi\u2019s blade finds the front of his throat, the slight gap in armor where the helm doesn\u2019t quite reach the breastplate. His body collapses in the clanking of armor, alerting the other two.\n\nThrough the thicket you see the twin horns heading in your direction. Quickly, you move to find cover. His plate boots stomp heavily on the forest floor. You wait until the sound reaches its highest point to strike. As if from the crow\u2019s nest, you swing down, one hand gripping a vine, the other around Kassi\u2019s hilt. The powerful strike, backed by the swinging momentum is difficult to land. You have adjust mid-swing to find the gap between armor. The blow sends both of you sprawling to the dirt, the horned helm knocked from Dresden\u2019s head.\n\nYou almost don\u2019t recognize the man. Despite being decades ago, the youthful appearance of Dresden is replaced by a scarred, hairless face as if he suffered a terrible burn years ago. The scars extend down his neck disappearing into the black plate.\n\nImmediately, you land in a front roll and prepare for the next series of strikes. The helm missing, you have more exposed area to work with. Dresden knows it as well and keeps his greatsword high to block your upward-aimed advance. You\u2019re careful not to focus solely on one target, and mix in quick thrusts and a slices towards the plated body of Dresden. The strikes may bounce harmlessly off the armor, but the distraction non-linear approach is what you\u2019re aiming for.\n\nYou unleash a barrage of well-executed strikes, sweeping low then high, weaving both blades through the air always moving forward, always setting up the next maneveour. When one blow is absorbed, you use the other sword to strike an undefended area. No defense is perfect. Eventually there\u2019s always an opening. You\u2019re alert, coiled like a serpent searching for exposed flesh where you will inject your deadly fangs. The opening is there, and you take full advantage.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, pain rips through the side of your body. You look down to find a spearpoint sticking through the left side of your torso. The third rider, Larkus, stands over you with both hands clutching his spear. He rips the weapon back, tearing the point through the initial wound. A cry escapes your lips as you collapse in front of the fallen Dresden. Kassi\u2019s sword falls to the dirt and you use the open palm to cover the bleeding. Seeing you drop, Larkus rushes to Dresden\u2019s side. He cradles the man\u2019s head in his arms and attempts to treat the wound at his neck.\n\nYou try to stand up. The most you can manage is placing one knee beneath you. Pain surges from your side. It\u2019s like grabbing a hot plate, except you can\u2019t let go. Larkus notices, and abandons his medical care of Dresden.\n\n\u201cYou deserve all of this and more,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFor what? Burying my oldest friend?\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cYes. The only loyalty you should have is for the Emperor.\u201d\n\nHe approaches, spearpoint at the ready. Here, in your last moments, you don\u2019t feel the sense of regret most others would have. Death is not something new to you. For many years you\u2019ve accepted that fact. It\u2019s truly the only certainty in life. You don\u2019t even regret siding with the Empire, the same Empire that\u2019s about to end your life. Everything\u2019s numb. Nothing really matters. The inevitable end has arrived and the gap between your birth and death is but memories soon to be dissolved with your last breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d you state more to yourself than Larkus.\n\nYour vision blurs, then becomes blackness.", "action_results": [{"action": "...", "result": "Two bright eyes stare intently at you. Instinctively, you sit up in the bed only to rediscover the pain at your side. You\u2019re in a small hut. Soft embers burn in the center of the room, rising through a gap in the rooftop. The eyes belong to a young girl, not much past ten years.\n\n\u201cRose. Go fetch our guest some tea,\u201d a man\u2019s voice rings from the doorway. The outside light, illuminating his frame, leaves his face mostly dark, although you see signs of a thick moustache. He approaches the bed, rolling the sleeves of his woodland-colored tunic up his arms, revealing sturdy forearms that are likely the result of years of workmanship. He sets a bow and quiver down next to the bed post. The bow may be of simple design, although the craft and quality of the wood are the finest you\u2019ve ever seen -- and the Empire spares no expense when it comes to war equipment.\n\n\u201cYou have no love for the Empire,\u201d the man speaks, partly questioning.\n\n\u201cIn fairness, it has no love for me,\u201d you speak truthfully, carefully.

What was Kassi to you? \u201cFriend\u201d wouldn\u2019t do her justice. It wouldn\u2019t be an accurate description of the decades you spent joined at the hip. It wouldn\u2019t be telling of the fact that you knew everything about one another, your tendencies, what got under your skin. It wouldn\u2019t speak of the countless near-death experiences you shared, up until the moment your hands finished the tally. Your lover? You loved her, and she you. Still, your bond was deeper than the bodily connotation attached with that word. You find yourself at a loss for words. There is not a single word that would accurately describe your relationship with Kassi.\n\n\u201cWife.\u201d\n\nClose enough. That will have to do. The man finishes the sentence for you. He continues. \u201cBrought your horse and cart out back. This is as good a place as any to bury a wife.\u201d\n\nRose comes back with two cups. She hands one to you and one to her father. She looks up, expectantly, for you to take a sip. After thanking her, you raise the cup to your lips. Cool mint washes against your tongue like a fresh breath of air. The warm liquid instantly soothes and compliments the herbal flavor. Your hands fill with the warmth of the cup, comfortably drawing your attention away from the pain at your side.\n\n\u201cThe tea helps. I can speak from experience,\u201d the man says, lifting his shirt to reveal a sizable scar along the front of his mid-section. \u201cMy reward in service of \u2018King\u2019 Aeric. I have no love for the man, but I\u2019d rather see him on the throne than some Imperial puppet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAeric is dead. You\u2019re now a part of the newest territory under the Empire\u2019s rule,\u201d you answer. \u201cThank you for saving my life. I really must be on my way. I need to put Kassi to rest.\u201d\n\nYou attempt to rise from the bed, but the wound proves stronger. The combination of the blood loss and relaxing effects of the tea gently sooth you back to sleep. You slip in and out of consciousness for a few seconds, willing yourself to take back control. A pair of bright eyes watch your head fall to the pillow, peering from behind the sturdy frame of her father.\n\n...\n\nYou stand at her grave, one hand on her blade and the other at your cane. Your spear wound is mostly healed, though it still gives you problems. The walking cane, carved by Richard, helps with the sudden jolts of pain. Using the cane as support, you kneel into the dirt and place your palm on the simple tombstone.\n\n\u201cWas this truly unavoidable, Kass?\u201d you whisper. \u201cYou know I only left you to confront the darkness within me, to protect you from it. Perhaps I was always meant to end your life, destined even. By the same coin, no one knows how long they are destined to live. Our joined strength may have well extended both of our lives -- there\u2019s no way of knowing if this life, if both our lives, were tragedy or otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe grave remains silent. You sense a pair of bright eyes watching you from behind a nearby tree.\n\n\u201cEither draw near or don\u2019t. There\u2019s no use in second guessing yourself, girl,\u201d you speak.\n\nShyly, she leaves the protection of the tree and kneels down next to you.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name girl?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cRose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Rose. You remind me of brave warrior I once knew. Would you like to hear about her?\u201d\n\nRose nods, her eyes shimmering aquamarine.\n\n\u201cI knew her when we were about your age. Can you believe someone old like me was once young? Strange is the flow of time. In moments it feels as if a pond, still and unmoving. Other times it\u2019s a flowing river, with treacherous rapids to navigate. This warrior, Kassi, was truly special. She taught me almost everything I know, while being only a few years older than me. It was a great burden she bore for my sake, having to deal with my undisciplined self and not let it discourage her own progress. I was saw her fight off ten men with nothing more than a small dagger. That\u2019s the mark of a true warrior, always finding the path to victory, always willing to do whatever it takes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were in love?\u201d Rose asks.\n\n\u201cI loved her more than myself -- that\u2019s why I left her. Listen, Rose, love is tricky sometimes. You\u2019ll find that out in a few years. Sometimes it\u2019s in the best interest of the other person if you\u2019re not around them.\u201d\n\nYou grab a handful of dirt from the burial mound and feel it slip through your fingers, feeling the soft tingle as it passes through. Your fingers and palm are left empty save for a small stain. \u201cIt\u2019s like this soil. I could clutch onto it tightly, protecting it from outside forces, but that would be detrimental to its purpose. No, better for it to be on the ground, at the risk of being trampled or washed away by rain. It\u2019s the only way for growth to happen.\u201d\n\nLeaning on the cane, you place your shins on the ground, sitting on your heels. You motion for Rose to do the same. She follows your example, and looks up, expectantly with bright blue eyes. You place your hands on your lap and take a deep breath, filling your lungs with the air around you, with the final resting place of Kassi.\n\nThe soft breeze whistles leaves into motion. The earthy smell from the dirt is still in the air, and you draw it in, putting the aroma to memory. You do as she taught you many years ago. You\u2019re uncertain of what your future has in store for you, but you will continue to practice. You will continue to honor her memory.\n\n\u201cWant me to teach you to become like the brave warrior?\u201d you ask.\n\nRose nods.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Question his meaning", "result": "Your blade lowers. \"What is the meaning behind your words?\"\n\nKing Aeric laughs. \"You truly will do anything for her, huh?

You still feel Kassi next to you. She begins to shift her position again, this time turning towards you.\n\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to wake--\u201d you start to say.\n\nAs she turns fully facing you, your heart briefly stops. Both of Kassi\u2019s eyes are sewn shut with black thread. She appears to be crying out, and her open mouth is firmly locked into position with black needles piercing her jaw and cheekbones. Her body begins to float in the air, still prone, as if an invisible rope is attached to her waist. Kassi hangs in the air for a few seconds. Then her body begins to bend backward. Vertebrae by vertebrae, her back makes a sickening crunch as it folds unnaturally. As her full spine is completely broken, she falls limp, the power suspending her in the air completely gone. Kassi\u2019s body bounces off the bed and flies to the floor in a single crash.\n\nParalyzed by an unseen power, you\u2019re forced to watch the abomination before you. Mocking laughter begins to fill your head. The slow cackle is too much to bear after witnessing the scene before you. You attempt to scream, but your lungs remain void of air. Unable to move, unable to breathe, you shut your eyes and wait for the end.\n\nSearing pain brings you back. Two hooks pierce your shoulder blades and suspend your naked body in the air. You\u2019re in a completely different room. The room is four evenly shaped walls built with square stone blocks. The surface beneath you is stained with your steady blood drip. You hear someone moving around behind you. Suddenly, the slack in the chains release, and you fall to the floor. Unprepared for the drop, you feel your ankle snap upon landing. You roll over to find Brother Samuel standing over your body holding a bucket. You attempt to cry out his name. He empties the bucket\u2019s contents on top of you. Some gets in your mouth and you recognize the liquid. Oil.\n\nBrother Samuel lights a match and holds it in the air. \u201cWe\u2019d be alive if you didn\u2019t arrive at the monastery,\u201d he spits. He drops the match on your oil-soaked skin. Immediately, the match bursts into flame and spreads over your skin. Brother Samuel watches you squirm and scream until the smoke blocks your intake of air. Your eyes meet his, and just before you see the world go black, he smiles.\n\nA firm grip on your shoulders shakes you awake. The shake is quickly followed by an open palm to your cheek. You sit up to find Kassi over you. Then you realize you\u2019re on the floor not the bed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask rubbing your head.\n\n\u201cI felt you moving in the night,\u201d she answers. \u201cI thought you were just getting handsy, so I kicked you to the floor. But then you kept shaking and I knew something was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a nightmare, like the ones from my childhood,\u201d you answer. \u201cI dreamt of great evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come. Come, let\u2019s meditate until morning.\u201d\n\nShe grabs your hand and leads you to the foot of the bed. You both sit cross-legged and attempt to empty your mind of the night\u2019s events. You try to focus on your Spirit, but all you can think of is the mocking laugh. It echoes within your head until morning.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}, null]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Tell me more about Form Mastery", "result": "\u201cTell me more about Form Mastery,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly that,\u201d she answers. \u201cYou\u2019ll demonstrate your knowledge of the forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe brothers have seen us do them countless times. What\u2019s special about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be judging every small detail. And they\u2019ll make you answer questions too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like fun,\u201d you comment.\n\n\u201cNot as fun as fighting,\u201d she replies. \u201cThink you\u2019ll enter?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Enter Form Mastery", "result": "\u201cI think I\u2019ll enter form mastery,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cUgh, why?\u201d Kassi asks. \u201cNevermind. Good luck.\u201d\n\nWith that, she leaves you alone. You slip the blindfold back on and hoist yourself to the beams. You leave the practice sword behind so you can focus on flowing through the forms. You pivot to the right, as if moving through water, and guide your arms to the proper blocking technique in the form. Then quickly you counter with a flurry of punches ending with left hook. The simplicity and sudden burst from the technique makes it a deadly combination.\n\nNext, you plant both feet down as if an unmoving tree. A slight bend in the knees gives your legs strength and balance. You cover your face with your fists and keep your elbows in, protecting your torso. Then, you move through the evasive weaving. Depending on your opponent's stance, the power blow will come from the left or right. It almost always comes from the limb that\u2019s furthest away. Best to avoid the power side and dodge to the other.\n\nFinally, you end your session with an offensive manevour. You open with a spinning heel kick, using the momentum to carry you to the next strike: a flying knee. As the form relies on quick, powerful explosions, you lunge from beam to beam to keep in constant motion. The idea of the form is to always be in motion. The opponent will naturally see your movements at a certain speed. Once they\u2019re lulled, you strike quick like a cobra searching for the fight-ending blow.", "action_results": [null]}, null, {"action": "Tell me more about Dueling", "result": "\u201cTell me more about Dueling,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cThis is my second favorite,\u201d she answers. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like the unarmed format except you\u2019re armed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s one on one?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYep!

The wooden longsword could be used with one hand or both. You admire the versatility of the weapon. Shields are too bulky for your style, though you respect the classic combination of offense and defence. You imagine your chances of winning are high if you get a sword in your hand. Even a staff would be fine, you are mostly worried about getting something unconventional like a flail or whip.\n\nThen you realize you don\u2019t even know which weapons will even be included in the competition. You focus on your basic techniques, the universal truths that apply to any weapon wielded, such as limiting your motion with the weapon. Wood is light, but wielding real metal can easily tire oneself out. Unnecessary movements may capture the eye, but they\u2019re not sustainable in a long battle.\n\nYou lose yourself in the practice until the dinner bell brings you from the trance.", "action_results": [null]}, null, null]}]}, null]}, null, null]}]}, null]}]}, null]}]}]}
