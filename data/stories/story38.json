Your home was once a part of the huge empire known as the Odranithic Order, until the people rebelled. There had been a bad harvest followed by a long winter, which killed many of the Northmen people. When the Odranithic Order had not sent any food northward, Vronar Coldslayer and his friend Bortusken Thunderbeard led the city of Norgurune in rebellion. After the war, both Vronar and Bortusken wished to rule. In the end, they fought After several years, the Order granted them all land north of the River Star. Over the years, the Northmen conquered the region known as Nearnorth, which was south of River Star and north of the present day border of Odranith.\n\n\nYou are sitting on your throne in the palace of Norgurune. You are very tired, as the last few nights, you have been plagued by vivid nightmares. In these dreams you saw undead creatures in the ruins of your home, wandering aimlessly. You were also visited by a spirit  that claimed  to be your ancestor, Vronar Coldslayer.\n\n\nHe told you that Norgurune was in danger. Bortusken's curse, given to Vronar before his death, is coming true.\n\n\nAccording to ancient scrolls, Bortusken said that when Farnorth began to forget about Bortusken, the children would die first. Then the nobles and kings, and then the common folk. Farnorth would become a barren wasteland, inhabited by the dead. \n\n\nAs you sit and think, three ideas come to your mind about what you can do.\n\n\nThe Norgurune Library is managed by a wizard named Forixis, who may be knowledgeable on the subject. In addition, there may be books or scrolls that could help you learn more about this topic.\n\n\nYour Court Wizard, Dardis is not as wise as Forixis, but he was born in Farnorth and seems to know a lot about legends.\n\n\nYour last idea is to search the city for clues. Although there is no guarantee that you will find anything, it may give you a chance to find evidence and talk to your people.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to the Norgurune Library", "result": "\"Maybe the library will be a good place to start,\" you mutter, then begin heading over. It is on the other side of the city.\n\n\n\"Where are you going, my lord?\" asks your advisor, Kanvar. He is a Mountain Dwarf from the Coldstone Mountains, to the east of Farnorth.\n\n\n\"I'm just going to the library,\" you reply. Kanvar nods, and looks back at the book he is reading.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAs you walk along the ancient stone roads, you see a woman on the side of the road, crying.", "action_results": [{"action": "Speak to the woman", "result": "\"What is wrong?\" you ask as you walk over to the side of the road.\n\n\nThe woman looks up, her eyes red from crying. In her hands, she is holding a brass ring.\n\n\n\"M-my daughter disappeared  last  night,\" she explains, still sobbing. \"I don't know why... Sh-she didn't seem upset or anything, and I didn't hear anything, uh, last night.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know what could have happened,\" you say apologetically.\n\n\n\"If you really want to help, you can come back to my house and look around.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Investigate the woman's house", "result": "\"I would love to help you,\" you say, then follow her to her house.\n\n\nShe lives in a small, two-room house in the west side of Norgurune. Upon entering the house, you smell wood smoke and cooked meat. On the table, a man is placing two plates of roasted goat on the table. You notice with a twinge of sadness that there are three chairs at the table. One for their daughter.\n\n\n\"M-milord,\" the man stutters, flabbergasted. \"I was no expecting you... I would have slaughtered one of your finer chickens to-\"\n\n\n\"It's fine,\" you say. \"I'm here to help you with your missing daughter.\"\n\n\nThe man nods and sits down.\n\n\n\"I did not cook enough for you, so you can have mine if you want,\" he says, handing the clay plate towards you. You decline.\n\n\n\"I'm Nargi by the way,\" the woman says. \"My husband is Toruc.\"\n\n\nYou shake their hands and sit down.\n\n\n\"So, when was the last time you saw her?\" you ask first.\n\n\nThey both start talking at the same time.\n\n\n\"One at a time.\"\n\n\nToruc stops talking to allow Nargi to speak.\n\n\n\"It was last night,\" she explains. \"We were eating some eggs and pork, and she was talking about how she had finally been accepted into school.\"\n\n\nOnly some children were able to go to school in Norgurune, and in most  villages of Farnorth nobody was educated.\n\n\n\"Then she went to sleep, and...\" she swallows sadly. \"Well, I guess that was the last time I saw her.\"\n\n\n\"I will make sure something is done to find out more,\" you say.\n\n\nYou stand to leave, but Toruc clears his throat.\n\n\n\"I know you won't believe me, but I heard something talking to me last night,\" he says. \"It had a voice that filled my head. It was awful. It said that Norgurune was lost.\"\n\n\nYou are immediately interested.\n\n\n\"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, what do you want to know?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "\"Did you see this creature?\"", "result": "\"Did you see this creature?\" you inquire curiously.\n\n\n\"No, I just heard it,\" Toruc says. \"Sorry.

Toruc shrugs.\n\n\n\"Something about avenging his master's legacy, and that  it was time for the children to play.\"\n\n\n\"Mmmhmm.\"", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "\"I think it is time for me to go.\"", "result": "\"I think it is time for me to go,\" you say.

It is a large, two-story building made of stone, like an ancient and powerful castle. A single tower rises up from the back corner. At the top is the office belonging to Forixis Labiris, a wizard from  Odranith to the south. He is very old, with long white hair and a thick white beard. He does not wear a pointed hat like many wizards do, instead preferring a top hat and luxurious black suit.\n\n\nWhen you enter the library, you embrace the warmth. Although cold and unforgiving on the exterior, the interior is warm and cozy so all who go there will be comfortable. Fuzzy rugs cover the floor and fireplaces are lit among the wall. Every ten feet, there are alcoves that contain inviting chairs and tables to place books. Above the chairs are torches, hung on the wall, to illuminate the library.\n\n\nYou reach the door that leads to Forixis' office and open it. After climbing a long spiral staircase, you reach his office. It is small, barely containing all the stuff that is within. A desk is in one corner, where the wizard is right now. He is reading a scroll, and does not notice you. Behind you, a large bookshelf contains ancient books and fragile scrolls.\n\n\nYou clear your throat, and he looks up.\n\n\n\"Oh, I did not notice you, my lord!\" he apologizes. \"What do you need?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "\"What can you tell me of Norgurune?\"", "result": "\"What can you tell me of Norgurune?\" you ask Forixis.\n\n\n\"Shouldn't you know about this, my lord?\" he points out. \"I mean, your father told you about it while you were growing up.\"\n\n\nYou shrug.\n\n\n\"I guess I forgot.\"\n\n\n\"Okay,\" he says, inhaling deeply.\n\n\n\"Norgurune was founded in about 800 or so, making it very old. Then, it was a part of the Odranithic Order. However, in 907, the people were starving because of a bad harvest. The king down in Towerhall was to busy fighting the elves of Anciarth to worry about us, so the people were angry. Why be a part of the Order if they starved anyways? So the current lord, Vronar Coldslayer, and his friend Bortusken Thunderbeard led the people in a rebellion. There weren't many battles at first, but once Anciarth was weakened they started sending men to Farnorth. We probably would have been defeated, but Bortusken was a better battle tactician than the average general. He ambushed Order troops, raided supply lines, and captured Order cities in Farnorth. Eventually, the king decided that the war had gone on long enough. In 917, he signed a treaty with Vronar, naming the province of Farnorth an independent kingdom. Vronar and Bortusken, once good friends, began to hate each other when both wanted to rule. They dueled, and your ancestor was victorious. Bortusken put a curse on the city of Norgurune before he was slain, however. I don't know what he said, exactly, but I sure hope for all of Dornathus' light that it never comes true.\n\n\n\"Farnorth is mostly inhabited by Northmen and Orcs who settled here once their jungles in the south got overpopulated. We are currently allied with the Odranithic Order to the south and the Coldstone Empire to the east. You are our sixteenth king.\"\n\n\n\"I knew that last part,\" you complain. \"I'm not that stupid.\"", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "\"What do you think of this prophecy?\"", "result": "\"What do you think of this prophecy?\" you ask, then clear your throat to recite it. \"When the people of Farnorth forget about Bortusken the Beard of Thunder, they will pay with blood and bones. First depart the children, taken  in the night like food stolen by a thief. Then the royals and nobles, the greedy and rich, will fall prey to their deadly demise. And last the common folk, whose ignorance is their doom. And then Farnorth will be the land of the dead, a haven for the wicked. Unless a hero true of blood, and heart of sword and shield, whose name can turn the cold away wields ancestral axe.\"\n\n\nForixis raises an eyebrow.\n\n\n\"I've never heard that before, and I have searched for what he said,\" he says. \"Where did you here that?\"\n\n\n\"I heard it in a dream,\" you explain. \"I was visited by my ancestor. Vronar Coldslayer.\"\n\n\n\"Well, that is certainly surprising,\" he says. \"And about the prophecy, I'm not sure what to make of it. I know it means that Bortusken wants to slowly kill the people of Farnorth, but he is dead. Unless he survived somehow and became some type of lich, then I don't know how he will go through with his threat.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, but what about the end?\" you ask. \"It explains how to defeat the prophecy.\"\n\n\n\"Maybe the axe is an artifact, and the hero true of blood is a specific person,\" Forixis says. \"Feel free to check the library for tomes.\"", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "\"Can I search your library?\"", "result": "\"Go on ahead,\" Forixis says, smiling.\n\n\nYou reach the bottom of the tower and begin walking around. After several hours, you have gathered up five books that may be of help to you.\n\n\nTales of Norgurune is about legends surrounding your city. It is fairly new, so some of it may be complete fiction. But still, you have taken it in case it will help.\n\n\nThe Kings of Farnorth seems to be a history of Farnorth's kings. By looking at the table of contents, you can see it goes up to the fourteenth king, your grandfather Gronol Coldslayer. Perhaps there is information within about the curse.\n\n\nPerhaps the most promising is Bortusken's Curse, which is self-explanatory. It is a pretty old book, but you doubt it is from the 900s.\n\n\nHeroes and Villains of the North shows a picture of who you assume is Vronar on the cover. If that is the case, it likely contains information on the duel between the two men.\n\n\nNorthman Artifacts is about the legendary items of Farnorth. The cover of this one shows an axe.", "action_results": [null, null]}, {"action": "\"Nothing, I was just on my way.\"", "result": "\"Nothing, I was just on my way,\" you explain, then depart.\n\n\nUpon leaving the library, you wonder what you should do now.

You look into his eyes, only to see that the sockets are empty. His face is pale.\n\n\n\"What in the name of Dornathus?\" the guard shouts. The wight takes a knife from within his cloak and slashes the throat of the guard within a second.
