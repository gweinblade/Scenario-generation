The entire wall is covered with similar messages, the High King\u2019s insignia proudly displayed in the middle. It\u2019s a simple insignia for a man who is the most powerful in the world. Your neighbor to the east, Supreme Leader Fargrave, might not agree. Still, it\u2019s your High King who is leading and profiting from expeditions to the New World, not Fargrave and the territory of Magda. Back to the billboard in front of you; another catches your eye. And yes, in the center is an upside down sword with a golden crown at the top.\n\nThe gunslinger\u2019s life is a hard lonely road. The High King offers abundance in both food and comradery! Safety in numbers!\n\nNot the most creative of slogans, or the catchiest, but something\u2019s doing the trick. Your peers are enlisting by the thousands. At this point, it\u2019s easier to remember who hasn\u2019t enlisted rather than who has. And who wouldn\u2019t join? There are countless stories of treasures discovered, battles won, and wealth sent back to families. The town crier wails every night on the High King\u2019s victory in the New World, seeping his message into the very dreams of the citizens of Alteran.\n\nRumors are that the New World is even larger than the Old. The High King\u2019s Alteran and Fargrave\u2019s Magda take up about sixty percent of the landmass of the Old. The rest is littered with various republics and \u201cthe people\u2019s blah, blah, blah.\u201d Who even keeps track of those small territories? None present an actual threat in either trade, military power, or--well, that\u2019s all that matters. Give it a hundred years or so and they\u2019ll all belong to either the High King or the Supreme Leader (spit). You\u2019ve never had the best of luck in the gambling den, but you\u2019d put your money on that bet every time.\n\nFools. Some things are just too good to be true. The New World speaks to a man. It whispers tender secrets of possession and satisfaction, lining the message with a good ol\u2019 fashioned appeal to man\u2019s stubbornness. Come to me, it says. Your efforts will be rewarded. It\u2019s a hard life, but the payout is well worth it. Or stay put. Live the rest of your life wondering \u201cWhat if?\u201d Men with no military experience sign up for the frontlines. For what purpose? To avoid asking themselves that very question. What if?\n\nFools. They can\u2019t think for themselves, needing the High King\u2019s expedition to lead them into a life full of adventure, putting their life in danger for material wealth and prosperity. And you? Heh. You\u2019re the biggest fool of them all. You enlisted before the New World expeditions even began.\n\n\u201cWere you going to join us or do you prefer the company of the billboard?\u201d\n\nYou turn to see Corporal Redding. The man\u2019s scraggly beard, now graying, is stained with ale, the top two buttons of his uniform open. The High King\u2019s military uniform. At times, it looks too proper for the messiness of war. Still, that\u2019s how the High King governs, with a proper chain of command and regal attire. A long sweeping coat accompanies the uniform, reaching nearly to the standard issue knee-high boots. It\u2019s a dark navy color, stitched with golden trim, seven buttons down the front, gold as well.\n\nRedding takes a large gulp of ale as he expectantly awaits your answer.", "action_results": [{"action": "\u201cThese posters are getting worse everyday.\u201d", "result": "\u201cThese posters are getting worse everyday,\u201d you comment. \u201cLook at this one. \u2018I lost my father to sickness, but gained another through the High King.\u2019 Do people actually enlist because of this shit?\u201d\n\nCorporal Redding laughs. A few ale droplets from his beard take flight in the air. \u201cHa! Those would be your esteemed brothers-in-arms. If anything, they can distract the enemy long enough for you to find an opening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a winning strategy. The High King will soon run out of meat shields.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful with that,\u201d Redding lowers his voice, sobering for a moment. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say such things in cities like this one. \u201cThe High King\u2019s superior weaponry and engineering vastly overshadow any of our shortcomings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a road of ups and downs,\u201d you say. Pondering a moment, you continue. \u201cActually it\u2019s more like a circle. Wizards used to rule the battlefield. Then we invented the flintlock. Then breastplates were worn without a full suit of armor as people realized the majority of bullets were hitting the chest area. Since that\u2019s the case, why weigh yourself down with steel greaves and gauntlets? But then these partially armored men found themselves severely underprotected against full armored knights, and guess what? More emphasis was put on training wizards, coming full circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cMakes you wonder what\u2019s next,\u201d Redding comments.\n\nYou sigh. \u201cProbably something similar to what we\u2019ve seen before, only to a much deadlier degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I disagree with you there. Come on and enjoy the company of the men. Who knows when we\u2019ll get another chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that an order?\u201d you lightheartedly ask.\n\n\u201cDamn right it is.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "There are twelve of you total, including Corporal Redding.

It\u2019s not a perfect system, but it\u2019s a clean one. Neat and orderly, just the way the High King likes it.\n\n\u201cAnd he shat his pants mid-swing!\u201d\n\nWhile the High King values pristine order, his soldiers have a different emphasis. Staying alive for one, the gentle manners of a gentleman coming second, and second is being generous.\n\n\u201cBastus, I was there. I seem to remember you being the one with the loaded trousers,\u201d another soldier chimes in. Lionel, perhaps the most proper of you all. His clean shaven head and face speaks to keeping military standards. You prefer to keep your hair long and a little scruff.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d Bastus ponders, placing a hand on his chin in thought.

Your mind began to wander early on. It\u2019s a story you\u2019ve heard before, one of Bastus\u2019 favorites to tell at the ale table. Man does he like telling stories revolving around a fecal focal point.\n\nAs night slowly creeps in, you excuse yourself from the table in order to rest up for the morning. Your journey to the New World embarks in mere hours, and you\u2019d rather not spend the first day nursing a hangover. You\u2019ll save that for midway through when boredom settles in, one of the perks of enlisting in the army rather than the navy. The High King\u2019s sailors will be hard at work; you just need to stay out of their way.\n\nCaught deep in thoughts of tomorrow, you almost don\u2019t see them.\n\nTwo brigands brandishing large knives step into your path, abandoning their hiding place in the comforting shadows of a nearby alleyway. Their clothing is poor. Not even boasting simple leather as protection, the bare minimum. Booze reeks from their breath, likely the only reason enough courage is mustered to approach a soldier in the High King\u2019s army. Even then, they seem a little hesitant.\n\n\u201cCan I help you gentlemen?\u201d your voice fills the silence of the night.\n\nThey glance at one another. \u201cWe\u2019re a little down on our luck, good sir, and could aid in the form of coin,\u201d one says.\n\n\u201cSeems you have enough luck to afford a bottle,\u201d you comment. \u201cSurely, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re too far down on luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunate we came across it,\u201d the other one inputs. \u201cWhat about tomorrow? What about--\u201d As he speaks, he walks towards your flank. You cut him off mid-sentence. The distinct click from your flintlock echoes from your palm.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s far enough. Now I\u2019m tired and a little drunk and I have to be up early tomorrow. I can\u2019t speak for you, but I highly recommend finding easier prey. You see, I\u2019m one of those soldiers who notch their kills.\u201d Briefly you flash the grip of your pistol. \u201cThat\u2019s only this year. The High King likes to ensure his soldiers have pristine equipment. You should see my issued flintlock from last year. The handle was a god damn puzzle piece by the end. Now I have no problem shooting you dead and continuing on my way. What will keep me up at night, is deciding whether or not your miserable bodies are deserving of being notched. I\u2019m leaning towards no, but a kill is a kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust looking for a spare coin is all,\u201d the first one answers. \u201cYou have a good night, good sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou as well, gentlemen,\u201d you say, allowing them to move out of your walking path. Perhaps when they\u2019re sober tomorrow they\u2019ll realize no soldier in their right mind would notch a flintlock. Perhaps they\u2019ll realize the High King doesn\u2019t refresh equipment every year. Perhaps they\u2019ll realize you were lying through your teeth. Perhaps they knew you were lying just now, but they caught the one and only truthful statement from your little monologue: you have no problem shooting them dead and continuing on your way.", "action_results": [{"action": "The next day", "result": "You didn\u2019t get as much sleep as you hoped. Such is the life of a soldier. When not touring, you\u2019re out late drinking. When on duty, you\u2019re fighting for your life. Sometimes those two actions feel the same. Either way, you\u2019re used to operating on minimal sleep. Despite how you feel, it\u2019s time to get up. There\u2019s a parade for your send-off, after all.\n\nIt\u2019s not specifically for you, of course. If anyone could claim that honor, it\u2019d be Captain Briggs, the ranking officer in charge of the entire battalion. Still, you doubt much of the man\u2019s commands are his. The High King loves structure. Orders are likely passed, trickling down like a pail of water spilled at the top of a hill. The result is a stage of stringed puppets, with the High King (and his trusted advisors) holding the strings.\n\nYou prepare for the parade with the rest of the company. Messenger boys arrive early in the morning to pick up equipment for the voyage. The High King\u2019s soldiers can\u2019t be seen lugging their own cargo. No, that wouldn\u2019t be proper. It\u2019s their duty to dress nice, to reflect the High King\u2019s honor in their apparel. It took a few times, but you\u2019re finally used to dressing as if you\u2019re attending a classy wedding when shipping off to war.\n\nThankfully, since the tour is first by sea, you don\u2019t have to strap on armor. Seems even the Alteran citizens will question the logic of a bunch of armored soldiers piling into a boat. The last border dispute your company took part in required marching through the streets in full plate. A few miles out of town, you were allowed to remove it. Whoever issued the command obviously has never marched in full plate before. The little show made the company a day late to the border. Corporal Redding sure got an earful for that, not that the man cared.\n\nYour long navy coat is buttoned completely to the top, tight against your neck, but not overly so. The length of the coat nearly touches your knee-high boots, which are freshly shined thanks to the High King. You holster your flintlock to your thigh. It melds underneath the length of your coat, poking its head through with each step. Your longsword crosses your back from right shoulder to left hip. The twelve of you, led by Corporal Redding, looking as classy as royal butlers, though a little more heavily armed, make your way into the street.\n\nThe parade takes you down the center street of the city. On either side of you, citizens gather to see the spectacle. Wizards, strategically placed, fire spells into the air. After a few of such parades, the High King learned fireworks get too messy. Someone\u2019s got to pick up the remains. With each explosive spell in the air, the crowd oohs and ahhs, the occasional child hiding behind their mother.", "action_results": [{"action": "Focus on the crowd", "result": "It may not be your first one of these, but damn if you won\u2019t enjoy it. It\u2019s not every day thousands upon thousands of people are cheering for you. As you march down the cobbled streets, you raise a hand and flash a smile towards the sea of faces. The result is a cheer from the crowd, their incessant cries raising in volume. That\u2019s neat. You\u2019re about to send them another wave when Corporal Redding stops you.\n\n\u201cEnough of that, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just giving the people what they want,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t draw too much attention to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nRedding marches in silence for a few seconds, then whispers back. \u201cIn the field, danger comes in the form of opposing colors. The city doesn\u2019t afford such a luxury.\u201d\n\nStrange. Corporal Redding is someone who typically enjoys the finer things in life, like a mug of ale and...well, sometimes that\u2019s all you need. What\u2019s got him spooked? Despite his tendency to drink, something that ails most soldiers, he\u2019s always been good to you. If he doesn\u2019t want you to react to the crowd, then you won\u2019t. An order is an order, even those arriving in cryptic form.\n\nYou continue your march taking on a stoic demeanor. Citizens love that version as well, a soldier mulling over the gravity of his situation, possibly marching through the streets of his city for the final time, a life risked for the glory of the High King. Eyes. Yes, there are countless upon you, but you suddenly get the feeling of being watched, not from a cheering member of the crowd, but from someone with an ulterior motive for attending the parade.\n\nYour eyes quickly scan through the crowd, searching for danger. It may be nothing. It may just be all in your head, but as a soldier you\u2019ve learned to trust your instincts. They\u2019ve kept you alive so far, so might as well continue the streak.

Along the way, a little girl breaks from the citizen barriers and runs up to you. She hands you a small flower, a single stem with blooming white petals, then quickly runs back to her mother.

The path of the parade takes you away from them. As you set the flower into your coat pocket, you silently hope the repercussions wouldn\u2019t be too great on the mother. Still, it\u2019s the watch\u2019s duty to preserve order. They can\u2019t have people rushing past barriers, children or no.\n\nYour home for the next few weeks stares back at you. Devastator, a galleon of tremendous size, boasting enough space for several companies to reside, while still maintaining ample firepower. Smaller ships, brigatines, travel in the fleet as the main defense, their smaller bodies able to navigate the sea for quick aid should trouble arise. The company, led by Corporal Redding, takes to the boardwalk and onto the galleon. They have you stand at the ship\u2019s rails, along with the other companies aboard Devastator. Just in front of the docks lies a stage and podium. It wouldn\u2019t be a proper send-off to war without a speech from the damn mayor.\n\nThe mayor takes position at the podium, dressed in a neat blue suit, his hair perfectly combed to the side. Next to him, a wizard casts a spell to magically project the mayor\u2019s words over the crowd.\n\n\u201cGood citizens of the High King! Greetings! (A cheer rises from the crowd). We have before us the finest men and women created by God, those possessing an unsurpassed bravery and call of duty. They have answered the call of their God and High King to bring our, yes all of our, glory to the New World. Unlimited wealth lies on the other side of the sea, a land so vast that it puts ours to shame. (Murmuring ensues.) Yes, really. It is imperative that each citizen does their part. After all, our enemies seek the same wealth. They seek to steal it from between our fingers. (Cries of anger). I know, I know!\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s arms move up and down like a little bird flapping its wings, motioning to quiet down the crowd.\n\n\u201cThis battalion isn\u2019t the first, and it won\u2019t be the last! With each voyage sent across the sea, the High King\u2019s claim is solidified even further in the New World.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s voice quiets down as if he\u2019s speaking softly to a friend. He even leans on the podium with one elbow.\n\n\u201cThis time next week another fleet is departing for the New World, a place of promise with endless possibilities. Do your duty. Enlist. Secure your future now. The world is in a time unlike another other, a New one lies before us, untamed and unkempt. Do your part.\u201d\n\nA bony finger from the mayor suddenly points at a single city watch member sitting at a table off to the side of the docks. Shining gold reflects sunlight, a perfectly fitted gold ring rests on the mayor\u2019s finger, drawing even more attention to his outstretched finger.\n\n\u201cSign your name on the list. Be a part of the High King\u2019s army. Bring glory to your country!\u201d\n\nWith the mayor\u2019s final word, the naval captains take that as their cue to set sail. Sailors follow orders barked from the helm, scurrying to untie rope and raise anchor. God damn there\u2019s a lot of rope on a ship. As the fleet sails away, you can\u2019t but notice the sheer look of horror on the face of the recruiter. A single man at a single table, hundreds of citizens rushing towards him. You can almost make out the faintest One at a time, please!

During that time, your days have largely been the same: Wake up to yelling sailors, attempt to fall back asleep--to no avail, then visit the ship\u2019s cook for stew and tea. After a few friendly exchanges, the cook switched your morning tea with morning ale. It pays to have friends in high places, or at least in charge of rations. Today is no different. After your morning routine, you find yourself sitting at the bow of the ship, dangling your legs over edge, sipping at your \u201ctea.\u201d\n\nFootsteps heavy on the deck cause you to turn around. Corporal Redding approaches, holding an entire pitcher of ale.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you score that?\u201d you ask, nodding towards the pitcher.\n\n\u201cCommand brings its benefits,\u201d he replies, taking a seat next to you. After glancing in your cup, he tops it off. \u201cStrange times we live in. A whole New World to discover. There could be others we\u2019re missing as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould be,\u201d you answer, taking a sip. \u201cOr this could be the last undiscovered region of the earth. Who knows?

The other men busy themselves at the card table. Well, it\u2019s just a storage barrel, but it does the trick.\u201d\n\nSeems your absence has been noticed, again. As if anything goes unnoticed stuck on a ship with one another. Your gaze turns from Redding\u2019s scraggly beard to the open waters before you. Sally III is sailing next to you, a schooner armed to the teeth meant to be the primary defence for the now-transport galleon you ride on. White foam crashes against its bow, spraying into the air like a child jumping into rain puddles. Blue water, far as the eye can see, surrounds you, painted with a fleet sent by the High King himself. This view is much preferred to your drunken colleagues, gambling what few possessions are theirs.\n\nBefore you can put the image before you into words, Redding speaks again. \u201cI get it. You know, kid. Sometimes I think you\u2019re too smart to be an enlisted soldier.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d you answer. \u201cI\u2019d rather just spend what little luck I have on staying alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoint proven,\u201d Redding smiles, leaving you to your thoughts. You notice he also leaves the pitcher of ale. As you pour yourself another, a shout from the crow\u2019s nest draws your attention.\n\n\u201cSails!\u201d\n\nSure enough, two pairs of them are barely visible on the horizon. They\u2019re a long way off, too far to tell which colors they fly. The High King isn\u2019t the only one taking advantage of the New World. The seas surrounding it are breeding grounds for pirates, hence Sally III and similar ships of the fleet. The ships could be harmless. Or they could be scouts for a larger force. There\u2019s also the possibility that Supreme Leader Fargrave (spit) is preying on the High King\u2019s vessels, masquardering his men as pirates. The two rulers may be at odds, but no blood has been shed as far as you know. Who knows, the wealth of the New World may warrant such a thing.

Perhaps you should have spent your time gambling with the others.\n\nThe expedition redirects their course, turning towards the two pairs of sails. Lady luck is truly on your side as the fleet is aided with the wind at its back. Each captain shouts orders to their crew from the helm, causing sailors to scramble into their position. Awful timing for you, downing a considerable amount of ale for how early it is, but there\u2019s no going back now. In the case you find an opponent before you, better keep that in mind. Ale-induced confidence has been the downfall of many men.\n\nSoldiers aboard each ship strap on leather armor, meant for traveling, and form ranks, you among them. One by one, a designated man runs down the line, placing spears in the soldiers\u2019 hands. It\u2019s not your usual weapon, but it\u2019s not unfamiliar either. Your longsword and flintlock rest comfortably in their position, should they be asked to play.\n\nThe sails draw closer. Downwind, the ships know they can\u2019t escape the approaching fleet, so they patiently await your arrival. As you draw near, the color of their flag appears. It\u2019s purple with three red stars in the corner: Fargrave\u2019s colors. The fleet stops just outside hostile distance, but still keeps its cannons and spellcasters aimed at the two ships. We may not start a fight, but we\u2019ll sure as hell finish one.\n\n\u201cHello, captain,\u201d a voice rings out over the water from one of the two ships, pronouncing the word as cap-ee-tan.\n\n\u201cAdmiral,\u201d Admiral Conway correctively answers. Conway is a woman with tight, pursed lips. Direct. Straight to the point. Captain Briggs stands next to the admiral. While technically being a captain, he\u2019s an army captain with no vessel to his name.\n\n\u201cAdmiral,\u201d the voice rings again (as add-meer-all). \u201cQuite fortuitous timing you have.

Remove all weapons and your overcoat. You may row a single transport boat over with one in accompaniment, also visibly unarmed.\u201d\n\nAs Fargrave\u2019s man bows, you see Conway whisper something to Captain Briggs. Whatever the man is told, you can tell he doesn\u2019t like it. After a few shakes of his head, he finally nods, then starts to scan the fleet watching the two leaders. His eyes lock with Corporal Redding, who is standing to your right and apparently the only one in command not averting his eyes from Briggs\u2019.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Redding utters. \u201cDust off your fine coats, gentlemen.

Too bad you don\u2019t actually get to dine on the food in front of you.\n\nNo, instead, you and the rest of Corporal Redding\u2019s soldiers get to play the role of servers tonight. A small dining table, though too large to be packed on a voyage (another opinion of yours), is placed in the center of Admiral Conway\u2019s vessel, Yarden\u2019s Lot. The galleon deck boasts more than enough space for the VIPs of the evening, which include the admiral, Captain Briggs, and Fargrave\u2019s man.\n\nUnsurprising at this point, fine dining ware is placed upon a satin table cloth, complete with lids for each plate. Utensils are put on the left side of the plate, obviously, and dainty wine glasses shine brilliantly behind each plate. It\u2019s standard practice between the High King and the Supreme Leader (spit) to present their best during a parley, often each side attempting to outdo the other in mannerisms and civility. The result is a fancy feast and your hands inside white, spotless gloves.\n\nAs you pour wine into one of the dainty glasses, Fagrave\u2019s man meets your eyes.

You are mistaken, my dear. I\u2019m not here to discuss any sort of surrender. I\u2019m here to discuss partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be none. Discussion ended,\u201d Captain Briggs inputs.\n\n\u201cWait just a moment, cap-ee-tan, and hear me out. Pirates. Brigands. Men of nefarious nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Conway directs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been causing us trouble on the seas. They think far out here, away from civilized nations, they can prey on whomever. It\u2019s in our best interests that they don\u2019t think that. I know where they are operating out of, but firepower is currently lacking.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does make a fair point,\u201d the admiral comments to Captain Briggs. \u201cThe New World needs to be established as a place of order. Lawlessness and piracy cannot be allowed to thrive. The High King knows this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs does Fargrave.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we were to aid you,\u201d the admiral begins. \u201cAll repossessed wealth is claimed by the High King.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were to accept your aid, the good High King can have half,\u201d the man answers.\n\n\u201cUnacceptable. The High King will have the entire cache.\u201d\n\nThe man looks around. \u201cAnd just where do you expect to store it? Your fleet appears to be transporting at capacity.\u201d Dump a few dining tables and boxes of white gloves, and we\u2019ll have room, you think to yourself. \u201cAllow me to make a proposal. You need transport ships. I have two with plenty of room for cargo. We\u2019ll serve as your transports for, say, thirty percent of the wealth. We\u2019ll surrender all artillery of course, which will be returned upon landing.\u201d\n\nAdmiral Conway sits back in her chair, pondering a moment. The man is right. She can\u2019t hold much more cargo. There\u2019s likely not even room to hold Fargrave\u2019s cannons, although the fleet can hold some, dispersed among all the ships. Continuing to the New World will mean risking the pirates\u2019 escape, allowing them to roam freely on the sea plundering as they see fit. No, she\u2019ll have to address them now.\n\n\u201cWe are in agreement,\u201d Admiral Conway says, offering a hand out.\n\nThe man shakes it. \u201cOh, and we\u2019ll need muscle to move everything.\u201d\n\nInwardly, you groan. Somehow, you know you will be volunteered, yet again, for the duty.", "action_results": [{"action": "Pirates!", "result": "The agreement made, the two men are sent back to their ships. Soon after, you see their cannons being retracted from trained positions. Fargrave\u2019s man is holding up his part of the deal. First, the schooners and brigatines, the ones carrying heavy artillery, navigate to surround the two ships, putting their full broadside facing the two ships as if to say, one wrong step, and ka-boom.\n\nThe galleons pull up, placing boardwalks between the vessels for transporting cargo. There\u2019s only room for less than half of them, which is more than enough to put Fargrave\u2019s men at a serious disadvantage. Outgunned, outmanned, any sort of betrayal would mean their end.\n\nAs part of the \u201cmuscle,\u201d Corporal Redding\u2019s team is assigned to travel with Fargrave\u2019s men.\n\n\u201cNow that we are comrades,\u201d Fargrave\u2019s man says, \u201cyou can call me by name. Captain Lugo, at your service.\u201d Lugo finishes with a deep bow. \u201cThat\u2019s Jerkins over there,\u201d Lugo adds, pointing at the man who accompanied him earlier, though remained from sight. Noticing your attention, Jerkins stops, flashing a gap-toothed grin, and turns to wave, much to the dismay of the others attempting to transport a cannon to Admiral Conway\u2019s galleon.\n\nLugo fills you in on the details. \u201cThe pirates are holed up in a cove half a day\u2019s journey from here. We\u2019ll be able to land at night and sneak up on the bastards. I\u2019m sure your leaders want the glory for themselves, so we\u2019ll act as the reserves, supporting as necessary. Once the way is clear, we\u2019ll get to work transporting the goods, good?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Corporal Redding answers on your behalf.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lugo finishes. A little bit aways, Jerkins flashes you another smile. Great.\n\n---\n\n\u201cThere are many smaller islands such as this,\u201d Lugo explains as you row silently in the night. Moonlight glints off the water, reflecting the stars sparkling in the night sky above. \u201cUnnamed, mostly uncharted. Perfect place for holing up pirates.\u201d\n\nThe sea is filled with boats transporting soldiers to the cove. The main fleet is anchored on the opposite side so as to not alert the pirates to your presence. At a moment\u2019s notice, they could be called upon to rain cannonfire down on the place. For now, however, Admiral Conway is content to use Captain Briggs\u2019 men.\n\nSure enough, several ships are moored on the island\u2019s inlit. The light from the moon barely allows you to see a small beach behind the ships, and behind that, is a series of primitive structures, likely in place before the pirates settled here. Built by who is up for speculation.\n\n\u201cThey fly under our colors,\u201d Lugo adds on. \u201cDamn scoundrels. They don\u2019t deserve to wear Fargrave\u2019s sigil.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupreme Leader Fargrave,\u201d Corporal Redding corrects, rowing next to you. Notably, he doesn't spit.\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Lugo answers.\n\nThe first line of rowboats land. Soldiers exit with deliberate attempts to keep from splashing water. Once two or three men exit, they drag the rest of the boat to the sand so the others have a quieter place to step off. Your rowboat does the same. The beach, now littered with the High King\u2019s men, ready to enact justice on lawless thieves, feels foreign on your feet. You realize it\u2019s the first time in weeks that you\u2019ve been on \u201csolid\u201d ground, and it will take some time to adjust--time that you don\u2019t have. A few awkward movements from your fellow soldiers alerts you that they are experiencing the same thing.\n\nThe primitive structures are built in a series of ramps and huts. A few fires shine from within windows, not many on the open ground itself. As you draw closer, you realize the huts have a central tube that runs through all levels, a community chimney of sorts. Perhaps it\u2019s not so primitive after all.\n\n\u201cHow do you handle an infestation problem?\u201d Lugo asks.\n\nThe answer comes in the form of a bottle and oil-soaked rag. Lugo takes a heavy swig from the bottle\u2019s contents, stuffs the rag down the opening, and flicks a match. Lugo chucks the bottle into the nearest hut. An explosion, rivaling that of a fire mage, erupts, filling the dark night with a sudden burst of light, like exiting a cave into the noonday sun.\n\nImmediately, those in your company follow Lugo\u2019s direction. Apparently, acting as \u201creserves\u201d means starting the skirmish with a bomb. Men\u2019s shouts fill the once-silent night air as the pirates scramble to muster a defense. The High King\u2019s soldiers surround the burning structures, cutting down men who seek to escape the fire within.\n\n\u201cThese folks have a firm grip on things,\u201d Lugo observes. \u201cMight as well get started on loading the boats.\u201d\n\nRedding looks like he wants to protest, but then realizes, or perhaps, thinks about loading cargo deep into the morning. Better to get it done now. The pirates rushing from the burning structures don\u2019t even bother donning their false armor showing the sigil of the Supreme Leader. Corporal Redding nods, and those under his command follow the lead of Captain Lugo.\n\nLike any good pirate, the wealth is hidden far away. In this case, it lies in the furthest structure on the highest level. Burying it deep in the sand underneath an X is too much work for a temporary location, which is what you take the cove to be, a short-term hideout until a buyer can be found. Lugging around wealth is asking for it to be stolen. Probably how the pirates came into possession of it in the first place. Along the way, you\u2019re met with haphazard resistance; some pirates are more concerned with surviving the fire, while others find a deep sense of honor within themselves and attempt to stop you. Either way, led by honor or survival, you cut them down, casually shooting a few with your flintlock.\n\nAfter traversing a winding ramp, wrapped to one structure like an overgrown vine, you arrive at the top level. A single platform lies at the top, a canopy above it for shade and protection against the occasional rain, leaving the sides open, a potentially lethal fall from this distance. Broken legs for sure.\n\n\u201cLugo, you mad dog,\u201d a grizzled voice greets you. Its origin is an older man, wrinkles displayed on his face like war medals. Hardened by years of combat. Like the others, he\u2019s not wearing armor, save for his weapons belt tied around his waist. \u201cHow the hell did you convince the High King\u2019s men to aid you. This is an act of open war between states.\u201d\n\nCurious. He speaks as if\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been too long, Porter. Wasn\u2019t hard, really,\u201d Lugo answers. \u201cI simply explained it\u2019s better for all parties if you are, let\u2019s say, unencumbered by that treasure chest of yours.\u201d\n\nThere are several behind the man along with trinkets and artifacts infused with precious gems. Strange\u2026Lugo speaks like there is a singular chest he means to take, one that is the cause for the entire raid.\n\n\u201cFools. Do you know what you have done? There is peace between our nations only because the New World expeditions are treated as if a competition, not open warfare. You have upset the balance finely keeping the generals at home, while explorers lead missions. All that is gone now, thanks to your little agreement with this pirate.\n\nPirate. Captain Lugo. Suddenly, it all makes sense. The fleet was so concerned with their rivalry with Supreme Leader Fargrave (may you spit), they didn\u2019t question the story fed to them. Law. Order. Competition. Conway attributed the ways of the Old World to the New. That\u2019s the problem with tradition: it makes the mind stagnant, somehow creating universality where the relative needs precedent.\n\n\u201cShame. You\u2019ve learned my dirty little secret,\u201d Lugo says to Redding and the company. At once, those under command of Lugo act from their strategically placed positions, pressing you and the High King\u2019s men to your knees, blades and flintlocks placed threateningly against the back of your necks.\n\n\u201cNow I will spare you the usual compelling speech as we\u2019re pressed for time. I\u2019ll just read you the main parts.\u201d Lugo searches within his coat pockets, humming, as if he were looking for his last match to light a smoke. \u201cAh, here we are,\u201d he says, finding a crumpled piece of paper. \u201cWealth. Equality. Freedom.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t have memorized that? Still, the choice presented is blindingly obvious.

Either you follow this path, or you finish the game (of life) prematurely. No, it may be presented like a decision, but it\u2019s sure as hell not one. You realize that you\u2019re not done living. Then again, rarely does a man decide he\u2019s done with life. Usually it\u2019s the other way around, occasionally the subconscious takes over, guiding him down that path, slowly, taking years, but eventually landing there. No, this is a simple choice. You choose life, even if that one brands you as an outlaw, an enemy of the state, oathbreaker. Hopefully your fellow soldiers make the same choice. A fraction of them do.\n\nThree of you remain, Corporal--well, just Redding now, Bastus, and yourself.\n\n\u201cSplendid!\u201d Captain Lugo exclaims, taking on a tone much too cheery for someone who just ordered the deaths of nine men. \u201cMy man, Jerkins, will show you the ropes later. We have many aboard the ship.\u201d Jerkins flashes you a signature toothy grin. Better get used to that. \u201cNow there\u2019s a small matter of proving your loyalty. Trust goes both ways.

Unfortunately, this man must die.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to this pirate!\u201d Porter, Fargrave's real man, pleads. \u201cIf you do this, you will thrust the New World into a war zone. Gods, the Old World will become a war zone. For what? To secure wealth? Your selfishness and greed will thrust both worlds into chaos.\u201d\n\nThe three of you eye one another, the weight of the man\u2019s words hanging heavy in the air. Your actions could have a much bigger impact than the current moment. Still, nothing\u2019s changed since choosing sides. It may be a life originating from greed, but it\u2019s life nonetheless. Better than death, at least to you personally. In the grand scheme of things it may not be\u2026\n\nA flash of light. Gunpowder burns your nose. Smoke rises from the barrel of your flintlock. The man looks down at his chest, surprise clearly shown on his face, before collapsing to the floor. The decision was already made, Porter\u2019s fate sealed simultaneously. You gain the ability to keep on living, but time will tell if the world is better off for it. Then again, you\u2019re only responsible for yourself; the world has managed just fine on its own, and it will continue to do so.\n\n\u201cLooks like we have quite the eager recruit, don\u2019t we, Jerkins?\u201d Captain Lugo comments, lightheartedly. Jerkins nods his agreement with a grin at his lips. \u201cNow, grab that chest and let\u2019s be off. Don\u2019t want the Alterans to pick up on our little ruse.\u201d\n\nWith Lugo\u2019s direction, his men make for the chest the captain alluded to earlier. Wanting to keep yourselves busy or at least appear busy\u2014something you picked up in the High King\u2019s army\u2014you gather nearby trinkets and valuables, stuffing them into a canvas bag. Your fellow recruits do the same. As you busy yourself, your eyes catch sight of the beach. Several pillars of flame rise where the crude structures once existed. The High King\u2019s soldiers slaughter their leader\u2019s biggest rivals. Should the tale reach it back to Fargrave, there will be repercussions. Silently, you hope they all die. The world, both the New and Old, are better that way.\n\nYou return back the way you came. Briggs and Conway are busy with the skirmish and don\u2019t pay attention to the line of \u201cFargrave\u2019s\u201d men transporting plundered goods. That\u2019s the plan, after all. Their ships can transport the wealth, the agreed sum going for the honor of the High King. No one says anything until you load the cargo back onto the ship, a few words offered, directing you where to place the wealth. Then, a statement that\u2019s usually followed by a pull of a trigger, a swing of the sword.\n\n\u201cAny last words?\u201d\n\nIn your case, it\u2019s the pull of a trigger.

Let the High King's navy take care of threats on the sea another time. As most of the fleet is designed for transporting soldiers, rather than geared for battle, it\u2019s best to mind your own business. It seems Admiral Conway holds the same thoughts that you do. She orders the men to stay the course. Her orders are to drop the soldiers, you, at the New World outpost. Like every good military man\u2014or woman\u2014in the High King\u2019s service, she follows orders.\n\nThe sails, realizing the fleet isn't approaching, stick on the horizon for a bit. Then they disappear from view. Truthfully, you're glad. You have no doubt there will be plenty of battles to fight in the New World, ones that are better fought sober and with solid land under your feet. As minimal as \u201cminimal losses\u201d are, it\u2019s never zero. No matter how one-sided a skirmish may go, good men always die on the winning side.\n\nAs your services are not needed this day, you return focus back to the pitcher of ale. Kind of the corporal to leave it for you. The conditions don\u2019t allow it to be kept in a cool cellar. As such, it\u2019s lukewarm to the tongue. Lukewarm ale: better than no ale, barely. It has a slight citrus taste to it, unlike the full-bodied malty flavor you typically enjoy. The day is yours to enjoy. Soon, they will belong to another.\n\nYou lean against the side of the ship, careful to find a place that is out of the way from sailors. It\u2019s not completely, there\u2019s no place like that aboard a ship, but it\u2019s damn close. Every so often a sailor will step within personal distance. For the most part, they\u2019re respectful about it. You\u2019re all in service to the High King, after all. Relaxed by the drink, the sun starting to shower its warm light across your face, you gently close your eyes. It's not quite sleep. But it\u2019s not full wakefulness either. Somewhere in-between, your mind draws to the past\u2026\n\n---\n\n\u201cFather is angry with you again.\u201d\n\nYou watch the scene unfold before you. It's your life, but you look from the outside, unable to control the actions of the child you once were. Oddly enough, when you were that child, actions still felt outside your control. A third party witness, you are familiar with the interaction between you and your sister. It\u2019s an event that reappears often when your eyes are shut.\n\nYou, barely eleven, respond. \u201cWhat did I do this time?\u201d\n\nThough only a few years older, your sister is mature for her age. Smart, too. She easily sees through your feigned deception. \u201cReally, now. Don\u2019t play games. You\u2019re bad at them. Master Gavin finished reviewing your test scores. You must be failing on purpose. No one scores that low. You got half of the questions wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cMathematics don't interest me,\u201d your younger version answers.\n\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Your sister throws her arms up in disgust. Her robes, displaying her class rank, dance in the air for a moment. Blue robe, three purple lines sewn at the shoulder. Blue for her class, purple, the highest, for her level, three lines signifying she\u2019s at the top. \u201cYour grades reflect on the entire family. You know Father is up for election this year. People won\u2019t vote for him if they think his son is causing trouble.\u201d\n\nUnderneath a plain gray robe, no stripes, you respond. \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything less than near the top is causing trouble. You know Father\u2019s rivals will spin this against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Father needs this much help getting elected, then maybe he doesn\u2019t deserve to be councilman.\"\n\nHer face falls. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend I didn't hear that...him, though, is another matter.\u201d\n\nYou turn to find Vladimir, your father\u2019s right hand man. Whatever Father needs, Vladimir gets done. In this case, a child needing discipline. His face is stern, unreacting to your insolent words. He simply offers a hand, motioning for you to follow him inside. You know where he is leading you. Vladimir, never Vlad, has his own room in the manor. On his wall hangs a certain club. You remember it well. Not more than two feet in length, marked with metal knots.\n\nFrom the outside, you watch the child take Vladimir\u2019\u2019s hand. They both know what awaits them; the child holds the same blank look. It\u2019s not the first time, they both seem to think. And it won\u2019t be the last. You try to scream. You try to warn the child, your younger self. It\u2019s ineffective. The course is set, and there's no straying from it now. In reality, the destination was already reached. But still, you can\u2019t help but warn the child.\n\nJust as always, you're unable to protect the child. The pair enter the manor, hand in hand. You\u2019re left alone, phantom wounds appearing in your mind, the pain a very real memory.\n\n---\n\n\u201cWake-y, wake-y.\u201d\n\nBastus stands over you. The large man, your fellow under Redding\u2019s command, motions to the jug at your side. \u201cWe\u2019re out.\u201d He directs your gaze towards the card game happening across the deck. \u201cMind if we borrow some of yours?\u201d\n\nYour mind briefly takes the view of your eleven year old self, standing beside your Father\u2019s man, Vladimir, discipline about to ensue. You shake it off.\n\n\u201cStill at it with the cards?\u201d you ask.\n\nBastus shrugs. \u201cWhat else is there to do?\u201d\n\nThe recent memory brings you to your next words. Gesturing to the jug, you respond, \u201cThis should be enough for a buy in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would join the game?\u201d Bastus asks, surprise clearly on his face.\n\nThe distraction will serve you well, something normally the ale is meant for. However, in this case, it\u2019s not quite doing the trick. Where one sin fails, another takes its place. You nod. \u201cI see a chair empty\u2026and wages to take.\u201d\n\nBastus laughs and offers a hand. His laugh is a hearty thing that carries on the galleon\u2019s deck. \u201cWe'll see about that.

If the reason you shared with Redding earlier still applies, it seems you\u2019ve got plenty of \u201cluck\u201d left for staying alive. Either that, or you never had any to begin with. You decide to go with the former.\n\nAnother day. Another endless stretch of blue water before you. Blue water, blue sky, brown deck. The view, magnificently beautiful at first, is starting to wear on you. Each day is the same. Some men enjoy not having responsibility to fill their time. Not you. You've always found it best to keep your hands busy, preferring work over extended amounts of leisure. That\u2019s part of the reason you enlisted in the first place, among other things\u2026\n\nWhile the others continue their lounging, you do the first work-related thing that pops into your mind: cleaning your flintlock.

It\u2019s not flashy by any means, especially compared to the pieces the Royal Guard carries. Theirs is more jewelry than weapon, although that's not an opinion to voice out loud. One doesn\u2019t make it into the Royal Guard by their fashion accessories.\n\nWith the High King\u2019s emphasis on appearance and decorum, it\u2019s a bit surprising the standard issued flintlock isn\u2019t more extravagant. Maybe it\u2019s because the common person can\u2019t tell the difference. Maybe it's because above all else\u2014even appearances\u2014the High King is focused on winning battles. You examine the flint. Shaped well, held firmly in place by a piece of darkened leather. Maintenance always begins with the flint itself. Unless a spark is made, it\u2019s nothing but a dull club. By the time you've dusted off the trigger and cleaned the barrel, your fellow soldiers are starting to wake. Expecting ridicule, you're pleasantly surprised as two others wordlessly join you, taking seats as if opposing card players. Bastus and Lionel, contrasting demeanors. One man is brazen and charges head first into the fray, while the other prefers to use his head before committing the body to action. The High King's army demands all types of men.\n\nWhere do you fit in?\n\nThat\u2019s the goddamn question of the century, isn\u2019t it?

Out of all in your squad, he's opinion is worth the greatest, although in the grand scheme of things it might as well be that of a recruit. Redding is in charge of 12 men, sure, but the High King\u2019s army spans hundreds of thousands. Even Captain Briggs is low on that totem pole.\n\nYour chest may not be decorated with ribbons or accolades, but your actions seem to have direct influence on the soldiers around you. For now, that manifests itself in a positive light: weapon maintenance. The thought appears in your mind, what if you had chosen a self-destructive activity? Would the others join you then? A small chuckle escapes your lips, causing Bastus and Lionel to briefly glance up from their work. You've been engaging in that sort of activity the entire voyage, aggressively attacking the Devastator\u2019s ale stores.\n\nDrinking, gambling, it might as well be in the job description for a soldier.

Don\u2019t you have a card game to get back to?\u201d\n\nBastus laughs, a deep roar belted from underneath his lengthy beard. \u201cLook-y here,\u201d he comments as he notices your approach. \u201cThe stones on this one. Funny how sailors can only grow a pair on the water.\u201d\n\nYou nod towards the helmsman, signaling he\u2019s got nothing to worry about. Bastus\u2019 questioning is bad enough without a partner-in-crime. \u201cYou seen Redding anywhere?\u201d\n\nBastus shakes his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not up here. There aren\u2019t many places to hide on this boat.\u201d A fact that agrees whole-heartily with the sailor manning the helm. \u201cWhat did you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cStrategy,\u201d you answer. \u201cThe voyage is nearing its end. I know little of the enemy that awaits us in the New World. I\u2019ve heard the reports. They border on ale room rumors. \u2018Blackbirds,\u2019 they\u2019re called, the savages that inhabit the land. Their way of life is primitive. Only the strongest survive, and that's why they boast strength and size far greater than our own.\u201d\n\nBastus\u2019 face falls, at least that which manages to show through his beard. He\u2019s used to being the one spoken of in that light. You continue.\n\n\u201cAnd yet I can\u2019t shake those posters from my mind. You know, the ones stating fortune can be found in the New World. I certainly haven\u2019t witnessed any of my fellow soldiers returning with bags of gold, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget about the colonies,\u201d Bastus points out. \u201cThe wealth may be being spent in expansion.\u201d Although he looks like a typical brute, Bastus is smarter than he looks. It makes you wonder if he tells crass jokes to hide his intelligence, masking it until use for the greatest reveal and effect. The helmsman, for instance, is unsuspecting of such mental ability.\n\n\u201cFair point,\u201d you concede. \u201cTell me you have not held the same thoughts.\u201d\n\nWith a sigh, Bastus responds. \u201cThe High King rules, and we soldiers fight. It\u2019s the way of the world, both New and Old. Whether one enlists to bring glory to the High King or advance his personal pursuit, the outcome is the same. We\u2019re crossing the sea to fight the High King\u2019s enemies. The path is set. There\u2019s no changing course.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. His viewpoint set, there\u2019s no need to further the conversation. After all, if things are what they are, according to Bastus, then speculation is useless. You tell Bastus you\u2019re going to continue looking for Corporal Redding. He\u2019ll certainly have more to say on the matter. As you leave, you catch the annoyed face of the helmsman as Bastus refocuses his energy entirely on the sailor.", "action_results": [{"action": "Lionel", "result": "The bald man sits below deck studying a map. If you didn\u2019t witness his activity\u2014and heavy activity at that\u2014at the gambling table, you would consider Lionel to be the most disciplined soldier out of the twelve. You figure the others would name you as such, although that mostly stems from your tendency to be alone. The High King must truly be proud of his army when the most disciplined are those who drink and gamble to a lesser degree than most.\n\nHe sits cross-legged, back against the wooden side of the ship, map sprawled out before him. It\u2019s not a high quality piece, colored with differing shades of oily yellow. It depicts Alteran, the High King\u2019s land, and fades into nonexistence where the New World begins, but not before listing the one location that you're familiar with: Frontrunner\u2019s Camp. It's become somewhat of a small city now, however it still holds the same established name from when it was nothing but scattered makeshift tents and a stick in the ground to tie horses to. The first colony claimed by the High King, every soldier knows of Frontrunner\u2019s.\n\nNot looking up from his studies, Lionel says, \u201cWe're almost there. Judging by the time spent at sea, and the distance to the New World, we\u2019re a matter of days out.\u201d\n\n\"You know there's a sailor aboard whose job is to figure that out,\u201d you comment.\n\n\u201cBah, sailors. Second-class soldiers. They enlist in the navy because true battle scares them. Glorified wagon drivers, if you ask me.\"\n\nEyes still on the map, specifically the section that fades into nothingness, you say, \"Is this the most recent edition? I had thought more was discovered beyond Frontrunner\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been,\u201d Lionel responds. \u201cBut they have not been approved to be official as of yet. I\u2019m sure there are copies floating around in Frontrunner\u2019s, unofficially, if you are that interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need for one as long as the command has it. They\u2019ll direct us, and we\u2019ll go. Knowing the territory doesn\u2019t change much.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoken like a true soldier.\u201d\n\nLionel\u2019s words rub you the wrong way, not for the first time either. It's nothing against the man himself. Put two people in close proximity for a while and they\u2019re bound to find a way to get on each other\u2019s nerves. His words indicate mindlessness on your part, whether on purpose or not, it\u2019s received the wrong way.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re unmarried, or at least that\u2019s part of the story. In your experience, the allure and attractiveness of being with a uniform, from the woman\u2019s perspective of course, wears off quickly. Generally it just takes a few nights. Once that\u2019s done, she's left wanting and you can\u2019t provide. The present situation with Lionel is different, obviously.\n\n\u201cThere's not much else for us to do,\u201d you answer. \u201cYou know as well as I that the High King values obedience and the chain of command. Let\u2019s say I knew of a better strategy than my immediate superior. If he's not willing to listen to me, then there\u2019s no use in sharing it. Gods know I\u2019d never step outside of the chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if stepping out saved more lives of the men?\u201d Lionel questions in a calm tone, unlike the rising volume of your voice.\n\n\u201cEven if. Each one of us knew the risk when enlisting. That\u2019s a possibility when joining the High King\u2019s military. Why should I put myself in harm\u2019s way to prevent an outcome that sure as hell didn't stop the men from signing up in the first place, an action that I am certain no one else would do for me. We soldiers follow orders. Simple as that. Rank and command can't afford to be undermined. Men die. Mistakes are made. That\u2019s just how the world is.\u201d\n\nLionel is quiet for a second. Then he responds, eyes never looking up at you. \u201cInteresting. And here I thought you were one of those \u2018by any means necessary\u2019 men. Achieve the goal \u2018by any means necessary.\u2019 Strive forward \u2018by any means necessary.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe final one hits home.\n\n\u201cSave lives \u2018by any means necessary.\u2019\u201d\n\nYou have no desire to keep arguing with the man. You cut the dialogue short, something you probably should have done a few moments earlier. \u201cWell, you've been wrong before, and you'll be wrong again. Glory to the High King.\u201d\n\nYou leave before Lionel can respond, not that it would matter. No Alteran citizen would dare to not return the statement. A perfect way to end any conversation. Gods, that man can be frustrating sometimes.", "action_results": [{"action": "Voyage (cont.)", "result": "\u201cLand ho!\u201d\n\nThe two words you've wanted to hear most finally ring through the air. It\u2019s mid-morning, the sun almost reaching the highest point in the sky of clouds, matching the fog floating near sea level. The air is cold. The temperature has been consistently dropping each day, or at least that's what it feels like. The days themselves have melded together without a steady routine, forced to stay within the same hunk of lumber. Leave the ships to the sailors. You prefer dry land. Anything for the High King, right? Right.\n\nAdmiral Conway starts barking orders and, in response, her sailors rush to perform the tasks assigned. Captain Briggs does the same, giving instruction to the officers underneath his command, Redding being one of them. Military discipline takes over. The card game is abandoned. Cups of ale tossed overboard. Uniforms buttoned from belly to neck.\n\nHowever undisciplined a soldier in the High King\u2019s army is on his own time doesn't affect his service when on duty. Countless hours drilling and training takes over. The twelve of you, under Corporeal Redding's leadership, line up on the Devastator's deck, three rows of four. Each man knows their place. Second row, left edge is yours. Soon, the entire deck is covered with formation, the soldiers doing their best to remain still during the steady rocking of the waves.\n\nIt appears off in the distance. A large shadow looming ahead. As the fleet sails closer, the fog parts a bit, like the opening of a curtain, revealing the land mass behind it. Its lush green looks black at first, dark color in contrast to the white fog it hides behind. The New World is a place full of life, full of opportunity. Soon, like the Old, it will be tamed, domesticated by the High King. Until then, you\u2019ll have to traverse the rugged overgrowth.\n\n\u201cSteady, men. Follow your commands,\u201d Corporeal Redding states as he paces in front of the formation, hands clasped behind him. \u201cBeach landing. Then RV at Frontrunner\u2019s Camp. That\u2019s all you need to remember.\u201d\n\nA large wave crashes into the galleon, causing a riptide effect on the deck. Soldiers near the impact stagger, regain balance, then resume their stoic positions, the same motion repeated across the deck. The galleons, with their heavily armed escorts, press on.\n\nYour destination is unlike the stories suggest. The stories promised wealth and adventure. They seemed to suggest fortune is at your fingertips, if you could just reach out and grasp it, leaving enough for the High King, of course. Instead, darkness awaits. Each listener knows the stories to be some measure of hyperbole, but the land mass suggests an entirely different narrative was shared. No clear rivers await. No finely-trimmed fruit trees. Just rampant overgrowth, like the fog, hiding more secrets within.\n\nIt is not your place to question. You imagine the same thought is running through your fellow soldiers. Probably for the officers, too, although they suppress it with strength of voice and confidence in command. The High King points and we march. He provides for us, and we bring him the means to support an entire nation. Questioning soldiers are cracks in armor. They're a sword crafted from impure steel. Their duty is to serve. Leave the decision-making to the superiors.\n\nCaptain Briggs takes center stage as you close in to land. He stands next to Admiral Conway at the helm, who has finally taken the wheel of the Devastator herself, something she was content to have others do the entire voyage. As with your send-off from Alteran, protocol calls for a good old-fashioned speech.\n\n\u201cSoldiers of the High King! Glory is ours for the taking. There is a New World to bring under the High King\u2019s rule. At long last we\u2019ve finally arrived. Untamed land and savage natives await. \u2018Blackbirds,\u2019 they're called, more beast than man. Not only does the land itself bring threat, so does our enemy!\u201d\n\nAround you, the more outwardly loyal soldiers spit on the deck. They know who Captain Briggs is talking about. Fargrave, Supreme Leader of Magda, the second most powerful man in the Old World, next to the High King himself.\n\n\u201cFollowing our glorious leader\u2019s action, Fargrave (spoken with distaste, intentionally leaving out Supreme Leader) has funded voyages to the New World as well. The jealousy of Magda is apparent. Their inability to think for themselves is well-known. Not only is it imperative we capture wealth and resources for the High King, it is equally as important to deny it to Fargrave.\u201d\n\nMore globs of spit hit the deck.\n\n\u201cYou know your orders. We march to Frontrunner\u2019s Camp. You\u2019ve had plenty of time to rest your legs and polish your boots. The camp is a three day journey inland. I expect us to make good time. There is an entire world to discover! Together, we will--\u201d\n\nYour vision ignites in a burst of flame. The previously gray, cloudy setting around you suddenly flashes in the red-orange light of fire. Next to the Devastator, an escort schooner steadily makes her way underneath crashing waves, leaving behind a trail of black smoke, the center of her deck boasting a crater, its edges still burning. Fireball. Much larger than the average wizard\u2019s, like the size of a siege engine\u2019s projectile.\n\n\u201cBrace yourselves!\u201d a voice cries out.\n\nAnother blast of fire hits a transport galleon, thankfully not your own. Soldiers on the deck are thrown from their neatly-organized formations. Upon recovery, they look unsure whether to return back to formation or look for cover.\n\nThe sun peers through the clouds, burning away the gray world around you. It grows bright, far too bright. You glance upward and breath escapes you for a moment. The sun hasn\u2019t appeared. Rather, the sky above is filled with burning flame. Gradually it rises, reaching its highest point in the sky, a slow climb, then crashes down in a fraction of the time.\n\n\u201cTake us in now. Go, go, go!\u201d Captain Briggs shouts from his post. Next to him, Conway spins the wheel, shouting commands to her sailors. Behind her, a communications officer signals the rest of the fleet by flag. Globs of fire rain down upon you, like spit hitting the deck, as the fleet takes you as close as it dares. Wind rushes by your face as you host the same inner debate as the soldiers aboard the galleon hit. Your eyes scan the quickly approaching land mass, searching for an origin of the attack. You find nothing, until the slightest moment catches your attention.\n\n\u201cFire back or be damned with the rest of us!\u201d Conway yells from the helm. Her eyes land upon the same movement that yours did moments earlier. Sailors cheer their acknowledgement and ready their cannons.\n\nUp on the land mass, high above sea level, you see many small figures, their dark form melding with the overgrown forest. The source of the attack, and the admiral knows it. One hand on the wheel, the other as a lever in the air, one she quickly switches to a downward position, signaling the cannons to fire. Explosion. Black smoke. This time, it originates from the fleet, the blasts a deep echo across the ocean water.\n\nAnother impact rocks the speeding galleon, sending those on deck sprawling. \u201cSoldier!\u201d a familiar voice carries through the noise. You look up to find Corporal Redding standing, his hand firmly gripped around rope tied to the Devastator's mast. He offers a gloved hand out, which you quickly take, allowing the corporal to pull you to your feet. His hand is then exchanged for rope, bound to the mast like the squeeze of a large snake. More blasts of fire. This time you remain standing.\n\nThe fleet sails forward at full speed. The goal is clear. Your large transport galleons must dock in order for their soldiers to have any effectiveness. Though they are fearsome warships, their current designation is nothing but a glorified transport. Their escorts, however, weave through, nimble, sailing circles around the transports, firing their broadsides with each passing, always in motion, readying their cannons for the next approach. Fire rains from the sky. Wind, sprays of water hit the deck with equal ferocity. Another schooner sinks beneath the waves in an explosion and trail of black smoke.\n\n\u201cSteady yourselves! We\u2019re coming in hot!\u201d Admiral Conway shouts from the helm. She expertly spins the wheel to minimize the inevitable impact.\n\nThe land mass grows larger and larger, like that of an approaching caravan. What was once a small dot on the horizon, now towers high above you. Dark green, almost black, overgrowth awaits, a visible line of contrasts starting at the edge of a sandy beach. No docks. No civilized structures await to safely anchor the fleet. Just sand and sea.", "action_results": [{"action": "The New World", "result": "The transports separate in the water, breaking off from one another. They\u2019ll be sitting targets while the soldiers unload. Your defensive vessels, receiving signals from the admiral, move into their position as well. Cannon fire begins a steady volley, almost continuous. Their booming echoes across the water, firing now in staggered groups. While one ship reloads another fires, soon to swap their actions.\n\nThe High King's discipline takes over. You and your fellow soldiers quickly organize back into formation. Each unit has a designated member to pass out equipment, Bastus being yours. Twelve of you in a line receive gear one at a time. In the chaos of battle, the soldier\u2019s training must be present. Standing still while fire falls from the sky is no easy task, and yet not a single man is out of place.\n\nA pack is thrust into your hands as you follow the man in front of you preparing for landing. Brown, simple leather, the High King's sigil pressed into one flap. They should be water resistant, at least if the military enchanter did his job correctly. Nothing like trusting your life in the hands of another\u2019s work. You jam your flintlock and accessories into the main compartment. No way in hell are you going to let water damage render the weapon useless.\n\nAdmiral Conway spins the wheel a final time, and shouts, a tinge of glee in her voice. \u201cThis is as far as I dare get.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still a swim to the beach. But still, comparing the Devastator to the others, you\u2019re a lot closer. She continues.\n\n\u201cTake the fight to them. Get vengeance for the High King. Briggs?\u201d\n\nCaptain Briggs, now on the deck, looks up to the helm and nods. Whatever plans they discussed is silently confirmed with a simple head gesture.\n\n\u201cVery good. Now off with you! For the High King!\u201d\n\nAmong the crowd of soldiers, you stand near the deck\u2019s railing and look down. It\u2019s not a far jump by any means, especially not into water. But still, it\u2019s at least fifteen feet to the bottom. The last thing you want to do is lose travel rations or something as equally necessary underwater. Saying a silent prayer--noticing it\u2019s only in situations such as this that you suddenly become religious, your feet step over the railing into the open air.\n\nWind rushes at your face. A sudden gust. Your body drops quickly. It's the feeling as if you're leaning too far in a chair, finding the moment just before tipping over backwards, only continuous.\n\nCold air.\nCold water.\n\nDisorientation accompanies submergence. For a second, you lose sight of which way is towards the surface and panic. Then as quickly as the confusion appears, it\u2019s gone. Others drop next to you, signaling the direction to swim. Your legs kick, arms weaving out in front of your face like a blind man feeling for objects to avoid walking into. Your chest begins to burn, crying out for oxygen. A few more strokes and you reach the surface.\n\nThe water\u2019s surface is littered with swimming bodies. It\u2019s a wonder no one landed directly on top of you. You follow the other soldiers swimming towards the beach, holding your pack in one arm as if it were a man you're saving from drowning. Your breath turns slow and deliberate in energy conservation. Flailing in the water is a sure way to arrive exhausted, considering you\u2019d even make it to the shore. Deep down you know the swim is only the first bit. No doubt you\u2019ll be marching towards Frontrunner's Camp without rest, that is, if the Captain\u2019s orders are to make it to the RZ. There\u2019s always the chance Briggs orders you to march directly to your attackers.\n\nWhatever the decision may be, there's only one in your current position. Breathe and swim, breathe and swim.\n\n---\n\nRelief rushes through your body as the water becomes shallow enough to stand. It\u2019s still difficult, wading through neck-high water, not to mention the cold spray from each passing wave, but it sure as hell beats swimming, as do most things. Your hand instinctively reaches for your right shoulder. A second wave of relief hits you as your wet palm finds the handle of your longsword. Miraculously it didn\u2019t drift away during the plunge. You glance around at your fellow soldiers. Apparently, it\u2019s not that much of a miracle as about half still hold weapons in their sheathes. Still, that leaves the other half with empty hands. Hopefully they were smart enough to stash something into their waterproof pack.\n\nWithout your immediate superiors in the area, you\u2019re content to stand still and catch your breath while you wait for orders. The only thing the High King\u2019s army hates more than a non-busy soldier is one who thinks for himself outside of direct orders. Since there are no current ones, you take the former approach. Admiral Conway\u2019s fleet grows smaller on the horizon, the ships retreating away from the land mass. Out of range, the fiery destruction is halted. The beach must be too close as no fireballs fill the sky above you. They did originate from elevation. Firing straight down toward the beach would have a rather awkward angle. That, or your attackers are concerned about setting the entire forest on fire. Perhaps, both.\n\nThe crowd of gathering soldiers begins to part. A lone man walks down the sudden aisle. Captain Briggs. His heavy overcoat is drenched and matted down, like that of mutt spending all night in the rain. The man doesn\u2019t look happy at all. A constant frown curves each end of his lips downward. You wring out a few drops of water from your shoulder-length hair as he speaks. Expecting another grand speech, you\u2019re surprised with the lone sentence that comes from Briggs\u2019 mouth.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the New World.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Take stock", "result": "With time before Captain Briggs commands the battalion to move, your immediate concern is with the company. There\u2019s different types of lost. There\u2019s lost in the night without lantern light. There\u2019s lost in the woods, far from the trail without a map or compass to guide you. And finally, there\u2019s a soldier separated from his company lost. The High King\u2019s strict adherence to chain of command leaves the common soldier without the authority to act on his own. What then does a soldier do with no command and the inability to act? Well, pretty much what you\u2019re doing now. You\u2019re damn aware of that fact and pride takes over.\n\nYou decide to look for Corporal Redding first. As the leader of the company, your best chance at finding the others lies with the man. You search through the battalion. Some soldiers remain standing, others taking the chance to rest on the sand. Either way, the beautiful uniforms of the High King are wet, sandy, and anything but regal. The same goes for the men wearing them, including yourself, the reality of conflict that remains unspoken to civilians and politicians. It\u2019s much more inspirational to have a well-dressed army, neatly-groomed, a proper soldier. The number of enlistees might harshly decline if they saw this side, and once you do see this side, it\u2019s much too late to back out. There\u2019s a reason why the enlistee contracted service is more years than the others.\n\nYour fellow soldiers hardly give a second glance as you continue your search. In other circumstances, a few insults and quips would come your way. However, now, each man is much more concerned with survival, checking their equipment, catching their breath, mentally preparing for what comes next. Their gaze is far from the present moment. Yours might be, too, if not for the present task you set for yourself. They stare sightlessly at the sand beneath their feet. It\u2019s not much different for those who do meet eyes; they notice the presence of others, and yet, recognition is absent. Brotherhood isn\u2019t apparent. Battle-shock. Exhaustion.\n\nYou search, and search, and search. Nothing. Not one familiar face is seen.

The rest of the battalion does the same, those finding their fellow squad members organizing themselves into a rough formation. Exhaustion starts to creep in on you.

No, the events since breakfast have certainly been sobering. Awake, alert, and drenched, you await command.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait long. Briggs is huddled with the platoon leaders, at least those that aren\u2019t lost to sea. You catch sight of Redding\u2019s unkempt beard among the others. He stands out being the only one without a close shave of both face and head, which would normally bring scrutiny except for his measure of success. As long as you\u2019ve been in the company, there hasn\u2019t been much failure. Whether that is reflecting of Redding\u2019s leadership or the men themselves is up for debate. One thing\u2019s not debatable, however: the man would be quickly replaced if his record was not as well-kept as his colleagues\u2019 grooming.\n\nThe commanding officers break and address their designated sections. Corporal Redding doesn\u2019t head exactly in your direction, so you follow to where he walks. You find the others nearby, only ten still remaining. Two lost in the fiery assault and swim. Large Bastus gives a nod towards you as you approach. The man\u2019s left sleeve is torn, blood soaking down the exposed arm, by the looks of the wound, shrapnel from a fireball explosion. It doesn\u2019t seem to bother him as his lips spread into a wide grin.\n\n\u201cThe lone wolf survives. And here I thought your legendary tale was cut premature by a little dip in the sea.\u201d\n\nHis demeanor quickly changes, taking in the present situation. Two lost. It wears heavy on the men. You try to fix his light-hearted outburst, and the effect it has on the others. \u201cNot the landing we expected. Still, at least you\u2019ve gotten your wash for the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough of that,\u201d Corporal Redding interjects. At his voice, you all seem to stand a bit taller. The High King\u2019s soldier isn\u2019t a sloucher, after all. He stands tall and proud, chin and chest raised high. \u201cWe\u2019re marching to Frontrunner\u2019s Camp. The battalion has lost a considerable amount of men and arms. Damn Blackbirds.\u201d Corporal Redding spits on the ground, similar to the way a decent man would react to mentioning Supreme Leader Fargrave. \u201cThere, we\u2019ll regroup and rearm. And don\u2019t you lazy men worry, there\u2019ll be time for rest, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow soon until we march on the hills?\u201d Bastus asks, obviously wanting to settle the score with your ambushers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Redding admits, truthfully. He\u2019s never one to withhold from the company. \u201cHalf span or maybe a full? I wouldn\u2019t be too hasty if I were you. We\u2019ve only just arrived after a long voyage, and the arrival wasn\u2019t quite what we expected\u2026 There will be plenty of time for vengeance. I suggest you rest up, acquaint yourselves with the New World. You\u2019ve all heard the rumors. The New World is supposed to be substantially larger than the Old. There are things here we\u2019ve never experienced. Vengeance lies in the future, yes. But for now, rest is more important.\u201d\n\nDespite his words, rest doesn\u2019t come right away. Officers shout their commands, and you form into lines, first a little scattered. Each soldier steps to his normal spot in the formation, although gaps are apparent from those who\u2019ve fallen in the skirmish. The space is quickly closed, formations becoming tighter, but the damage is done. Along with exhaustion, death hangs heavy in the air, coupled with near half of the battalion being unarmed. Sheathes lie empty, quivers absent of arrows--even the occasional one-boot soldier. The battalion marches toward Frontrunner\u2019s camp, broken and beat.\n\n---\n\nThe journey is supposed to be three days. It takes four. The pace is slow, overgrowth halting progress several times. Exhausted soldiers take turn chopping vines down, clearing the path for the battalion. Similarly at night, shifts are taken to watch against threat. Military tactic states now is the perfect time for a follow-up ambush. The enemy, you, is scattered and lacking firepower. Those still wearing armor is nothing but light leather, only able to protect a surface slash. There\u2019s not protection against arrows or direct piercing, not to mention fireballs. But still, the march is quiet, both from the enemy and among one another.\n\nThere\u2019s no laughter. No triumphant chants or songs toward the High King. Simply, marching. You step one foot in front of the other. You stop when Redding tells you to stop. You start again when he says. Your mind\u2019s gone to auto-functioning, the body reacting to orders while the conscious sleeps. Step, breath, another. Step breath, another.\n\nPerhaps if the arrival was different, you\u2019d be interested in the setting around you. The overgrowth and all that it holds is foreign to you. After a while, unrecognizable plants and sounds stop standing out. At first, the eye and ear instantly drew to each, abandoning all else for the New World\u2019s novelty. That faded after the first day of marching. Now, they all blend together in a mix of confusion, curiosity and excitement gone. Your only concern is stepping one foot in front of the other, breathing in-between.\n\nThe fourth day, just after the sun\u2019s peak, Frontrunner\u2019s Camp appears. It\u2019s nothing like the name suggests, being more city than camp. It\u2019s filled with solid structures. In the New World\u2019s overgrown state, lumber is plentiful, allowing the \u201ccamp\u201d to have actual buildings, even if they are only from wood. No doubt they will be reinforced with brick or stone once resources allow. Still, it\u2019s a huge upgrade from a collection of canvas tents. Merchants know it too. Many from Alteran made the voyage as well, seeing the same opportunity in the New World as the High King. That\u2019s where their similarities end, however, as the city is obviously military-driven. From what you can see, at least two-thirds of the people walking the street wear military garb, whether that\u2019s armor, robes, or ceremonial attire. One thing you do notice that\u2019s not military-driven is the wall, or rather, lack thereof. A place such as Frontrunner\u2019s should be reinforced defensively. Instead, it\u2019s just a cluster of wooden structures. After the way the fireballs greeted you, the organization of the city feels wrong. It feels damn wrong.\n\nStill, though, it\u2019s not your place to question things. Your job is to follow orders. They tell you to march, you march. They tell you to rest, you rest. They tell you to put your things down in Barracks Four, you put your things down in Barracks Four. \u201cB-4\u201d isn\u2019t much as far as lodgings go. You get assigned a bunk and a small chest. Calling it a chest gives too much credit. Your sole storage compartment holds as much as a single drawer of dresser, not that you have anything to place in it for now.\n\nYour waterproof pack, property of the High King\u2019s, was returned back for however the High King sees fit, although since arriving to Frontrunner\u2019s it would have just taken up space. There\u2019s not much use for a waterproof traveling pack in the comforts of a city. B-4 itself is just as compact as your storage space, only offering enough bunks for the twelve of you, rather, the ten of you. Two beds rest empty, their assigned inhabitants doing the same at the bottom of the sea.", "action_results": [{"action": "Explore Frontrunner's Camp", "result": "The entire battalion is given a few days to recover. Instead of taking the time to rest, you rather explore the camp. It\u2019s your first time here, after all. For all you know it may be your last. Eventual death aside, you would rather be out than sit in a crowded barracks all day, even if your body is screaming for more sleep. Like a traditional military camp, the higher-ranking officers bunk near the center. The farther out you go, the lower-ranking members you see. Following suit, the finer establishments are located near the center since that\u2019s where the wealth is, and the farther out you go...yeah, you\u2019re beginning to understand the layout of the camp, city, whatever the place is.\n\nB-4 is located at a mid-range, if not slightly lower. Not a horrible place to be, but not upscale either. It\u2019s all relative anyway. You\u2019re sure those at the edge view you similarly to the center-dwelling folks, the inverse no doubt happening. That stuff has never really bothered you. Comfort has a way of corrupting a man\u2019s resolve. You\u2019d rather have your principles intact than money in your pocket. Of course, that\u2019s the mindset of a man who\u2019s never truly had his pockets empty.\n\nYou find yourself on a main street. Not the main street, a main street. With Frontrunner\u2019s Camp built center-out, there\u2019s a circular layout, referred to as Rings. There\u2019s one street called Main street that cuts through the center, but it doesn\u2019t reach the outside edges. It\u2019s left solely for the upper-class to travel. The closer a ring is to the center, the smaller it is. So, there had to be a way of connecting them together, hence Main street. Beyond that, \u201cmain street\u201d is simply the largest street that inhabits a ring, circling through an entire set of buildings.\n\nStanding on a main street, you decide to visit\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Tavern", "result": "Easy decision, huh? Some are harder than others. This one is a no-brainer for a soldier. To be fair, \u201cR&R\u201d is commonly referred to as grabbing a drink. Soldiers in the line of duty tell their immediate officer they need a little R&R, and everyone knows what that means, at least until you reach a certain threshold, captain, the one in this case. It\u2019s an inside joke between infantrymen, but it holds some truth to it. Officers respect it. They understand. Soldiers don\u2019t abuse it. It\u2019s the unspoken agreement between those with an undecorated military career. Captain Briggs ordered you to rest? Hell, you could use some R&R. It\u2019s been a strenuous journey, to say the least.\n\nYou walk down the main street. It\u2019s large enough that the circle format doesn\u2019t feel like one. The angle is slightly enough to notice that you can\u2019t walk in a straight line. But still, it doesn\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re heading across bends. At this point, you\u2019re not picky. You weren\u2019t before departing from Alteran, and you aren\u2019t now that you\u2019ve arrived in the New World. Starting your search, you silently commit to entering the first tavern you come across. You find the Hanging Bridge after a few hundred steps. Either B-4 has a perfect location or there are many taverns in Frontrunner\u2019s. You guess it\u2019s the latter.\n\nLike the buildings surrounding it, along with every other in Frontrunner\u2019s, it\u2019s built from wood. However, the Bridge is a darker shade, giving the tavern a shadowy effect, a place of refuge from the beating sunlight. Only in this case, the sky is cloudy, but still, refuge is most welcoming. You enter through the front door.\n\nInside is similarly dark. The hearth burns a low ember. Various candlesticks are strategically placed in the room, spread out enough so that light is not overwhelming in one area, but still close enough for the edge of their glow to touch each other. The bartender stands behind the bar, a dark wood one of course, polishing it with a rag. His face is shrouded in darkness, although white teeth appear, revealing a smile as you approach.\n\n\u201cFresh off the boat?\u201d he asks, his voice the sound of grinding two rocks together. You can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s trying to be friendly or make a joke. You suppose it could be both.\n\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d you answer, plopping down onto a bar stool. It\u2019s then that you notice how empty the establishment is. To be fair, it is rather early. \u201cWhat do you got?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat don\u2019t I got? Fine reds from the Alteran Vineyards--imported at great expense, mind you. Brandy from Sars Hillside that will burn the back of your throat and soothe it at the same time. And New World whiskey, distilled myself. A few shots will have a horse stumbling back to the stables.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you answered your own question,\u201d you respond with a smile.\n\nThe bartender reaches for a bottle, plainly shaped compared to the others. Its label isn\u2019t bright; it doesn\u2019t catch the eye. Its contents are near the bottom, which is telling in itself. Someone enjoys the drink. That\u2019s a good sign, unless the bartender is dipping into his own supply. A small shot glass crashes down hard on the bar top, and the distinct sound of a cork echoes throughout the empty room. The bartender fills the glass almost to its brim, spilling a few drops.\n\n\u201cInterested to hear what you think, soldier,\u201d the bartender says, expectantly.\n\nYour hand grabs the glass. It\u2019s cool to the touch. Smooth. You toss back the drink in a single gulp. The whiskey itself is unlike the glass, and could hardly be classified as smooth. Rough. Scratchy. Rocky. Those are more accurate descriptions. But the flavor is something else. It follows a second after the initial shock, hints of handcrafted oak barrel and, oddly, campfire smoke. It\u2019s both jolting and relaxing at the same time, painful yet comforting.\n\n\u201cGods above and the malicious devil below. What is this stuff?\u201d you ask, staring into the empty glass.\n\n\u201cMy own special blend,\u201d the bartender says. \u201cThe New World offers more ingredients than I ever imagined before making the voyage across the sea. It\u2019s a place of wonder and discovery\u2026\u201d The man trails off at the end. You know a cue when you see one.\n\n\u201cAnd...?\u201d\n\n\u201c...and great danger--as most places where wealth is to be discovered are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now. That\u2019s confidential information, shared in the sacred oath of silence between bartender and patron. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m glad to be tending bar, rather than back out in the wilderness.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you were a soldier then,\u201d you conclude.\n\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d the bartender returns your words back.\n\nIt\u2019s silent for a moment. Then an idea pops into your head. \u201cI\u2019d like to try the brandy after all.\u201d As the bartender reaches for a bottle unseen underneath the bar, you stop him. \u201cNo, not the Sars. That one.\u201d you point to one behind him, near to the floor.\u201d He nods and reaches for the bottle. He tries to hide it, but you see it clearly now that you\u2019re searching. One leg, too stiff to be natural, unable to bend at the knee. A prosthetic, and one unenchanted by his movement. It might as well be a peg leg. You\u2019re willing to bet it\u2019s the same dark wood that the tavern is built from.\n\nThe bartender pours you another glass. You raise it up. \u201cTo the cruel mistress we call fate and the \u2018blessings\u2019 she showers upon us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d the bartender says, grabbing a glass for himself. You clink them together and toss back the brandy.", "action_results": [{"action": "Duty calls", "result": "A few days later the company is called upon. Given ample rest time, which you gladly made the most of, your commanders now expect contribution, and after a few days with no orders, the company is ready to give it. At the start of the voyage from Alteran, the soldiers were content to sit idle, drink, gamble, and sleep the day away. After many weeks of it, along with the landing, you\u2019re ready for action. There\u2019s a major difference between a soldier who\u2019s trained for battle versus a soldier longing for it: the company is both, and desperately wants to bring the fight to the Blackbirds. Passion fueling training, a man\u2019s heart aligned with the command of his officer; that, is a scary enemy to face. The Blackbirds will feel the High King\u2019s vengeance.\n\nUniform neatly cleaned, pressed as well as possible, the ten of you organize under Corporal Redding\u2019s command, packing equipment for a march inside B-4. The grizzly company leader says it better than anyone. \u201cTime you lot earned your keep. Drinking the ale stores aboard the High King\u2019s fleet simply won\u2019t cut it. Glory for the High King, glory to your lineage.\u201d\n\nNot the most inspiring as far as speeches go, but Redding holds an unconventional style that speaks to a man. Genuine. One man to another, rather than top-down. Lionel speaks up. Straight to the point, as always.\n\n\u201cOrders, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got something of a special assignment,\u201d Redding answers.\n\nBastus cuts him off before he can continue, perhaps a result of Redding not leveraging rank, not that he ever seems to mind. \u201cSpecial? So we won\u2019t be marching on the Blackbirds that assaulted us?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot directly,\u201d the corporal says. \u201cWe\u2019ve noted their location for the Frontrunner scouts. Those who have settled into their tour are better suited to march to combat. This goes above Captain Briggs, even. Rest assured, they will be dealt with.\u201d\n\nSilence hangs over the men, each likely thinking they would be involved in the High King\u2019s retribution. Two members were lost in the landing. Promises were made. Revenge was to be yours. Seems command has another idea, however.\n\n\u201cOur orders, then. Sir,\u201d you keep the conversation going.\n\n\u201cRun-of-the-mill patrol,\u201d Redding speaks, pulling a piece of string from his tunic. Satisfied at its removal, he continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a set of ruins northwest of Frontrunner\u2019s. Command hasn\u2019t been able to spare enough soldiers to explore the area. That\u2019s where we come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatrol? No combat?\u201d Bastus asks, the shoulders of the large man seemingly slumping with his rhetorical question.\n\n\u201cNo hostiles anticipated, no. You know as well as I that there\u2019s always the possibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about these ruins?\u201d you ask.\n\nCorporal Redding looks right at you with his response. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of fallen temple, a holy place once used by the natives here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s so special?\u201d you ask, again.\n\n\u201cYou mean that an order from an officer in the High King\u2019s military isn\u2019t special enough for you?\u201d Redding lets his words sink in for a second, a grin appearing at the edge of his lips. \u201cOk, here\u2019s added background detail, so you can bring greater glory to the High King, of course. The fact is, our wizards, scholars, and tacticians haven\u2019t been able to figure out the source of the Blackbird power. The current hypothesis is that it lies with their religion. If we can learn something from their beliefs, then it may help with nullifying their power.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean besides the fact that they stand a full head taller than the largest Alteran,\u201d Lionel points out.\n\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, little man,\u201d Bastus instantly retorts.\n\nRedding waves a hand to silence the two before the conversation deteriorates into bickering. \u201cHave you already forgotten our landing? The natives, the Blackbirds are crude in their technology. And still, they were able to sink our ships. It doesn\u2019t matter if they stand two feet from the ground if their magic allows for the destruction of ships. We may not be engaging those who stole the lives of our two brothers, but we could very well discover the secret that will collapse their entire military might.\u201d\n\nYou take the opportunity to sum up. \u201cSo we\u2019re to patrol a set of ruins, ones that may hold the secret to an ancient power of a New World, into uncharted territory, while it\u2019s uncertain whether traps or enemies lie in wait, ready to ambush us?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you put it that way, it does sound like a rather important assignment,\u201d Bastus comments.\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Lionel can\u2019t help but say, a murmurous echo from the rest of the company.\n\nCorporal Redding simply holds his grin.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "Equipment packed, you depart from Frontrunner\u2019s Camp shortly after Corporal Redding\u2019s \u201cinspiring\u201d speech. Despite the fact that your company is down two men, you aren\u2019t reinforced to the normal 12 members. The New World forces must be thin if protocol is to be broken that way, which only reinforces the need for green soldiers to patrol a set of ruins. If there were anyone to spare, they\u2019d have explored the area already. It\u2019s not often the Alteran military finds itself thin. In the Old World, it possesses more might, resources, and land than the rest, although Fargrave may dispute that point. Here, however, it seems things are different. The land is vast and the number of enemies are unknown. Truly a place the High King\u2019s soldiers have no experience with.\n\nSurprisingly, no other company joins you, only adding to the afore-mentioned facts. You can\u2019t think of another time where the company went on its own, certainly not for an entire mission. But still, it\u2019s not your place to think. That job is left for soldiers with more ribbons on their chest, their families with heavy coffers.\n\nRedding leads the company from the front, the rest of you arranged two-by-two. Bastus takes the rear by his lonesome, the large man counting for two on his own. The forest is thick. Like the overgrowth to which you arrived, the journey makes for slow going. It\u2019s just thin enough to cause the occasional swipe of the sword to clear the way. Luckily, you aren\u2019t required to chop your way through the entire jungle-like growth.\n\nTrees and plants, unlike you\u2019ve seen before, lie in your path. At first they blended together, a mix of unfamiliar flora becoming one. But now that you\u2019ve been up-close and personal, on two occasions now, you\u2019re starting to see recognizable overgrowth, a tree trunk wrapped with vines spreading to its branches, small ferns that close in on themselves when touched. The ferns in particular made a few soldiers jump at first--along with a joke from Bastus about filling one\u2019s trousers. As the journey continues, you step on them without a care, unblinking to the movement underneath your feet.\n\nAs full of life as the forest may have first appeared, there\u2019s something off-putting about it. Overgrowth is just plantlife flourishing rampantly. While it should signify just that--life--it doesn\u2019t give that sort of feeling in the slightest. Quite the opposite, actually. It\u2019s the light, or rather, lack thereof. Thick canopy above, the overgrowth doesn\u2019t allow sunlight to peer through. Instead, you\u2019re left to trample through the forest floor in a dusk-like darkness, eyes long adjusted, the mind is slower to follow. It\u2019s a wonder that the plants can even thrive in such a place, without sunlight. The scholars at the High King\u2019s University would fill their trousers at the chance to study them. You silently commit to laying your bedroll as far away from Bastus after that thought appears in your mind; his poor taste in jokes is contagious it seems.\n\nA day of trudging through the forest waning down, you begin to set up camp, something that must be done earlier in the day thanks to the shady canopy above, and it\u2019s not like you can simply light torches and continue. Despite the increased chance of drawing attackers, you run the risk of setting the whole damn place on fire. You estimate the day isn\u2019t yet three-quarters down, and you\u2019re settling in for the night. As you find a nice spot, free from roots poking their heads through the dirt, Bastus notices and puts his roll next to yours.\n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re bunkmates again,\u201d the big man comments.\n\n\u201cLucky me,\u201d you utter.", "action_results": [{"action": "Sleep", "result": "The trek begins late in the morning, unable to start at standard military march time due to the lack of light. The other men in the company take the time to catch up on sleep. The thing is, you\u2019ve had plenty since arriving to Frontrunner\u2019s, enough to recover from the landing. Alone you sit, back rested against the trunk of a tree, the world dark and formless around you. It would be peaceful except for the restlessness that seeps into your being. resting when you should be acting, sleeping when you should be awake, patrolling when you should be fighting. But you\u2019re a soldier, paid to follow orders, not think. The restlessness channels itself into the constant shake of your leg, able to stop when focused upon, but quickly starts its steady rhythm subconsciously.\n\nIt\u2019s quiet. Unlike the forests of Alteran, full of wildlife making themselves known, the forest of the New World is silent, like a predator stalking its prey, a thief in the shadow of an alley. Your thoughts are interrupted by the sudden need to relieve yourself. Like the trees around you, you step without a sound over the sleeping bodies of the others, your coat hanging from your shoulders unbuttoned. You find a lucky tree, one of the varieties with vines wrapped around the trunk as if a serpent. Your trouser buttons soon are in the same state as your coat, the pressure in your bladder slowly subsiding. The silence of the forest is interrupted for a few lengthy seconds by the sound of your stream. You turn to head back to camp--\n\n--and find yourself staring face to face with a woman.\n\nShe\u2019s a native. Despite the first Blackbird you\u2019ve seen up close, your mind is very far from her strange attire, the color of her skin, the shape of her face. Oddly enough, you think of the unbuttoned state you were just seconds ago, your manhood out in the morning air. It\u2019s not the same as being caught with your pants down, but it\u2019s damn near close. You flash a smile, hoping the embarrassment is too apparent on your face.\n\nThe moment passed, you finally get a good look at the woman, noticing that she does not return your smile. She wears a dress of tanned leather, not meant to accentuate her womanly parts--they are doing quite a good job on their own. The woman\u2019s hair is black, like the darkness on a moonless night, loosely tied with a single braid running down the left side of her face. Unfamiliar symbols line her ankles and wrists, black tattoos almost unseen in the low light. She\u2019s unarmed, yet the lean muscle on her sleeveless arms clearly shows that she is not deterred by the fact. You guess she\u2019s a few years older than you.\n\nYour hand tenses in a half reach towards the flintlock at your thigh, like that of a duelist, watching, ready to burst into movement. Your eyes meet the woman\u2019s. Hers are a bright green, a reflection of the canopy overhead. Yours, a deep brown like that of a sturdy trunk.\n\nShe whispers a string of words unfamiliar to you. All that you\u2019ve heard about the Blackbirds never included their language spoken. Perhaps no one has gotten this close before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d you whisper back, motioning your hands and shrugging your shoulders in a way that would be apparent to any Alteran of your meaning.\n\nThe woman\u2019s face is blank; no sign of recognition appears. Although she may have spots of dirt on her, as well as not keeping up with the latest Alteran fashion, she\u2019s undoubtedly beautiful, her skin like that of her dress, tanned, each side of her face a mirror of the other.\n\nShe whispers again. You recognize some of the words, but only because it seems to be the same string as before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d is all you can muster for a response.\n\nThe Blackbird woman stares at you for several seconds, her green eyes steady and focused, her mind searching for a solution. She finds it. Her voice in the common tongue is broken. Simple. Straightforward. Stripped of unnecessary inflection. There\u2019s a strange tone to it. It\u2019s sharp. Direct. Higher pitched as a woman, but yet carrying the strength of a stage performer required to project. Unwavering. All of this you catch in a single word.\n\n\u201cGo.\u201d\n\nBefore you can respond, the Blackbird woman scampers off into the trees. You know better than to chase her. There could be others lying in wait, the woman herself the bait. Even if she\u2019s alone, there's a risk of becoming lost in the overgrowth, separated from your company without a hope of rescue. No, your mission is to patrol the ruins, not run after local natives through the trees. Still, the meeting itself felt...friendly?\n\nThat\u2019s as best as you can describe it for now. Go. Was that a warning? A threat? A plea? Hard to tell without knowing Blackbird social customs. Being the veteran of many tours, you\u2019re well-aware of different mannerisms that accompany different territories. Meeting the eyes is considered rude in some, while it\u2019s perfectly polite in another. The offering of a left hand is as good as a slap in the face, while it\u2019s the crudest gesture to use the right. That sort of thing. After making the mistake of forcing Alteran custom on your first tours, it\u2019s not a mistake you plan to make again.\n\nYour eyes deeply attuned to the dark, you start to notice the smallest signs of light appearing through the forest canopy. You will be traveling again soon. It would be best to return back to camp. You retrace your steps, a little more carefully this time in the case the Blackbird woman wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nLuckily, you don\u2019t run into any others. As you reenter the camp, the distinct sound of a flintlock click fills the morning air. You raise both hands up defensively instinctively.\n\n\u201cGods, boy. You can\u2019t go running off like that,\u201d Corporal Redding says as he holsters the weapon.\n\n\u201cHad to find a nice tree to water. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to cause jealousy,\u201d you reply. The joke causes a small chuckle among those standing near.\n\nYou think about sharing the encounter with the Blackbird woman, but you hold off. Now that you\u2019ve had a longer chance to think about it, it seemed more of a warning than a threat. She did not carry any weapons or show aggression. She was alone, meaning she intentionally did not bring warriors with her, not even for protection. Strange that one of them would go out of her way to help. Your first encounter with a Blackbird is not what you expected. For one, you\u2019re both still alive. These thoughts rest on your mind like a word escaping memory recall, a puzzle missing a key piece.\n\nThe company packs their gear, doing their best to hide the camp\u2019s presence, and marches on.

You even feel as if your eyes can see better in the constant dim light, although part of that is due to your mind\u2019s recognition of your surroundings, not needing to focus on single things to identify. Just a glance is enough.\n\nStill, you\u2019ve kept quiet about the Blackbird woman. The encounter sits within your thoughts, a new mind tenant who\u2019s taken up permanent residence. If there was a time to bring it up, it was two days ago. You still think it was better not to share. The mission is the ruins.

To face it in real life thrusts the mundane into fable.\n\nThe ruins themselves are built within the overgrowth, a part of the forest, their foundation as deep as any root. Dark stone, almost pure black, blends in the fallen structures to the low-lit environment. In their former glory, the ruins would no doubt be built in square stones stacked upon one another, creating sharp corners and a sturdy defense. Now, however, they are crumbling, decaying in the forest. Vines, trees, and overgrowth use the deteriorating walls for support, growing, twisting and climbing up the dark stone. There appears to be four, maybe five, main structures--it\u2019s hard to exactly tell in their fallen state.\n\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d Bastus breaks the silence, ever the one charging forward. \u201cWe\u2019ve marched here for a whole lotta nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush yourself,\u201d Redding whispers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if any natives are in the area, taking shelter within.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would they be taking shelter? The trees offer more cover,\u201d is the big man\u2019s retort.\n\nCorporal Redding doesn\u2019t address the question. He doesn\u2019t give it validation. \u201cWe\u2019ll break into two quads. Sweep the perimeter, opposite directions. Observation only. Engage only if engaged upon. Meet on the far side and wait for my command.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat only accounts for eight men,\u201d you aptly point out. Just the right time to open your mouth.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Mathematician,\u201d Redding answers. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay put with me. We\u2019ll scan the ruins. If the quads cause movement from within, we\u2019ll relay a warning to the others. One for each quad. Any questions?\u201d\n\nThe men only shake their heads and organize themselves into two groups of four. Lionel leads one and Bastus the other. Crouched, weapons drawn, the men creep off in their respective directions, each quad covering half of the perimeter. You take cover behind a fallen tree overlooking the ruins and wait. You do not draw your weapons, but check your holster and sheath, ensuring they will not stick. A few minutes of silence passes. You do not break it. Neither does Redding. The corporal suddenly digs inside his pocket and reveals two thin cigars. They are a deep brown, like the color of a well-brewed mug of liquid chocolate.\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t expect us to light those up now,\u201d you whisper, eyes turned back to the ruins.\n\n\u201cAre you disobeying orders, soldier?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nHe places one in your hand. \u201cI\u2019m told these are rolled with native leaves,\u201d Redding explains. \u201cThe Blackbirds supposedly smoke the leaves through long pipes, often staying lit for hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d you can\u2019t help but question.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s a familiar smell. It\u2019s a friendly smell. Who knows what sort of strange scent we give off. Have you ever wandered into a field with unfamiliar smells? It draws the senses.\u201d\n\nYou see where Redding is going. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I often journey through unexplored flower fields, but I get your point.\u201d He hands you a match next, which you quickly light on the side of your boot, finding a small section that\u2019s uncovered with dirt. A puff of smoke fills the air. Redding places the end of his cigar against yours, inhaling and lighting it without wasting a second match.\n\nThe flavor is new to you. A freshness accompanies, like the bite of an apple plucked directly from the tree, a cold gulp of water taken from a spring. Then relaxation ensues, a sudden calm rushing through your body quicker than any crashing wave, its subsiding like the tide returning to the ocean. Another puff. Another rush.\n\n\u201cI have known you for how long now?\u201d Redding asks.\n\nA strange question for the moment. \u201cNearly four years, give or take a few months,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cAnd have I ever given you reason to doubt my judgment?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But not for my own well-being.\u201d\n\nThe answer brings a grin to the corporal\u2019s lips, one that is rarely absent. \u201cWise choice of words. You are not afraid to speak your mind, and yet you follow orders. Both must be present in a good soldier. Without questioning, a soldier is but a body armed. Without following, he is undependable. You are both armed and dependable. It\u2019s sad to say, but that is not the same for the company. Bastus is the former, Lionel is the latter. You are both parts combined.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I appreciate the compliment, but this is hardly the time and place for such reminiscence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is exactly the time for such a thing. I will ask something of you now, and you must speak your mind and follow orders.\u201d\n\nYou do not speak. Corporal Redding continues.\n\n\u201cI am going into the ruins, and I need you to follow. I have been less than truthful with the others. Our patrol is simply a cover for another, more important assignment. I need a man I can trust, one that will speak his mind and follow orders. Are you that man?\u201d\n\nWith a puff of smoke, you say, \u201cYou know that I am.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Speak your mind", "result": "\u201cBut also, you need someone you can trust. How can I trust you when you have deceived the others?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cMust I reveal all to all men?\u201d Corporal Redding retorts in a voice that reminds you of your childhood teachers. \u201cDoes a commander disclose his entire charge to the battalion? No. The burden of leadership is keeping secrets. Compartalization. We have a mission. It is not every man\u2019s burden to bear, only the one designation for such a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithheld information is one thing. Blatant deception is another,\u201d is your answer.\n\nThe small grin on Redding\u2019s face grows larger. You can\u2019t help but feel you\u2019ve stepped into his trap. \u201cImagine you have a child of your own. A son who dreams of becoming a soldier. You read him bedtime stories of conquers, of warlords accomplishing great deeds. And yet, he possesses a weak body, one that has difficulty holding a sword, lacking the endurance to hold a proper shield wall. He asks if he has what it takes to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and join the High King\u2019s army. What do you tell him?\u201d\n\nYou ponder a moment. \u201cI would tell him it\u2019s no easy thing. I would tell him that he must train his body to become a soldier. I would pour myself into seeing that he accomplishes his task. Your analogy is not a great one. If limited by physical means, even after devoting himself to training, I would tell him the truth to save his life. I would say he does not have what it takes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you know he will enlist anyway?\u201d\n\nYou know the damage it would cause, a father instilling doubt in a young mind destined for battle. A soldier needs resolve, the willingness to press through any adversity. Still, you stand by your answer. \u201cIf he is my son, then he will not care. He will enlist anyway to prove me wrong. He will fuel the fire within to make me eat those words.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo either way, the outcome is the same, perhaps the lie is better suited to prevent hurt. The lie would preserve the relationship between father and son.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe men\u2019s outcome will be the same. I have deceived them for the greater good, for their own good. I need you with me. I share the truth so you do not enter into battle with doubt.\u201d\n\nYour course is set. There\u2019s no use in further debating with the corporal. You\u2019ve already given your word to follow. There is no sense in delaying the inevitable. But there is still a small part of you that wonders if the truth disclosed is the real thing, the entire thing. If he is willing to deceive the others for the greater good, it might be the same for your situation. Nearly four years, give or take a few months. He\u2019s not led you wrong yet. You hope he doesn\u2019t change that fact.\n\n\u201cYour point is well taken. Shall we?\u201d\n\nCorporal Redding\u2019s grin turns into a full-toothed smile. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Follow orders", "result": "Cigars both at your lips, you survey the ruins a moment longer before moving. Confident that you will remain unseen, you swing your legs over the fallen trunk and land softly on the other side. You guide your longsword from its sheath, slow, as not to send its ringing into the silent air. With your sword in a comfortable, ready position, you sneak forward, Redding just ahead of you. The overgrowth covers your approach. More than a few trees and plants lie between your hiding spot and the ruins, more sprouting from within.\n\nRedding leads you past the first structure. Its walls are brought to the ground, only showing signs of its former life in sporadic areas in jagged edges, like the coastline of a map. As you pass, you catch sight of decaying items: chairs, tables, even what appears to be a religious figurine, all of which have been long exposed to the elements and show it. The same thing happens for the second. The third is where Redding stops. It\u2019s clear to see why. It\u2019s the largest of the fallen structures, appearing to be nearly twice the size of the first you passed by. Like the others, its crumbling walls display signs of life, long abandoned. Besides the sheer size, another factor separates it from the others.\n\nIt\u2019s littered with human skeletons.\n\nTheir sharp white bones stick from the ground, keeping pace with the rampant overgrowth surrounding them. Some lie scattered, skulls far from their spines; others are more or less intact. All appear to be human bones, likely Blackbirds, long gone from the world, not a single one with skin attached. Interesting. Their skeletal structure looks the same as Alterans. Not that you\u2019re a man of science by any means, but it\u2019s grimly fascinating. Despite the large size of the Blackbird males, they are still human, as if you needed to see their skeleton to reach that conclusion.\n\nThe thought causes you to pick up a nearby bone and compare it to your own forearm. The bone is nearly a size and a half larger. Noted. Don\u2019t entangle with a Blackbird strength vs strength; you may have a fair amount of lean muscle, but you also have a realistic idea of your own skill set. A schooner doesn\u2019t broadside a galleon without outmaneuvering, after all.\n\n\u201cPut that back,\u201d Corporal Redding sharply whispers. \u201cOver here.\u201d\n\nYou look up to see Corporal Redding holding open a trapdoor. The square piece of wood is hinged completely open, revealing a square darkness below. A shiver runs down your spine, the cause of realization, the feeling of being watched. You immediately drop the arm bone. Experiment over. Redding stands behind the door holding it open for you. As you draw near, you can see a thin rope ladder attached near the door\u2019s opening. The feeling rushes through your body again, the feeling of a close friend lying to your face, the unfortunate truth of a woman turning down your advances.\n\nRedding motions for you to take the ladder first. Hopefully that\u2019s not the reason he brought you along--to test the strength of a thinning rope ladder. Who knows how far the fall is? Your thoughts quickly return back to the Blackbird arm bone. If the ladder could support someone of that size, surely it can support you. You hope. As you step towards the trap door, a pattern emerges. The skeletal bodies strewn out, seemingly random, appear to have an epicenter: the trapdoor. Like Frontrunner\u2019s Camp, they're arranged in rings, circling around the trap door.\n\n\u201cSee you at the bottom,\u201d you casually comment to Redding.\n\n\u201cNot too quickly, I hope,\u201d the corporal replies. After seeing your face, he says with a grin, \u201cBad joke. The ladder\u2019s fine. Once you\u2019re at the bottom give the rope a few tugs, and I\u2019ll make my way down.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too quickly, I hope,\u201d you return the jest, taking both hands on the rope ladder.\n\nThankfully, the ladder is more sturdy than it appears. But still, there\u2019s a slight sway as it holds your weight, a steady rocking with each step down. As you travel down fifteen, maybe twenty rungs, you\u2019re enveloped into complete darkness, the sole source of light a square opening where Redding stands. However, by that point, you\u2019ve become accustomed to the spacing, muscle memory serving to place your feet and hands exactly where they should be, exactly where the next rung appears. You take it slow. There\u2019s no sense in rushing down. You don\u2019t know how far down it does, and you aren\u2019t thrilled with the idea of finding yourself a hundred feet up in the air drained of endurance. By the same coin, you aren\u2019t thrilled with the idea of encountering enemies at the bottom drained of energy either.\n\nYou continue your steady pace until finally your boot hits solid ground rather than a rope rung. You breathe a sigh of relief, stretching out your arms and legs from the excursion. Looking up, you can still see the square of light fairly well. It\u2019s about fifty, sixty feet up if you had to guess. A tug of the rope, and it starts to sway slightly, supporting the weight of Corporal Redding. The square of light is darkened completely. Redding must have shut the trapdoor. You silently hope he has a way of reopening it. Surely, he must. Doors aren\u2019t usually locked from the inside, especially those that sit at the top of a sixty foot climb. But it\u2019s the New World, after all. Stranger things have been seen. In less time that it took you, Corporal Redding\u2019s boots land on the ground with a solid thud, his hand making a similar sound on your shoulder in reassurance.\n\nThere is no light...wherever you are. Redding flicks a match, and soon you can see minimally, but far better than before. You find yourself at the end of a tunnel. Wherever it leads, there\u2019s a single path forward. This must be some sort of escape route leading from underneath the ruins, hence the trapdoor. There\u2019s not anywhere else to go, so you and Corporal Redding follow the tunnel.\n\nIt winds, taking you around a few broad curves, but for the most part, it\u2019s a straightforward path. Whoever dug the tunnel probably meant for the quickest route possible, only twisting out of the way of large unseen rocks. You\u2019re content to allow Redding to take point. He hasn\u2019t shared anything else with you, why he deceived the rest of the company--or at least details why. His reason is rather vague, and you trust the man to lead you despite his secrets, although you\u2019re sure to keep a healthy amount of skepticism. Nothing crippling, just enough that outlandish requests will be seen as such. There\u2019s enough blind devotion in Alteran.\n\nThe first match dies. Another is lit. Before the second one dies, another light source appears.\n\nIt\u2019s the light of dusk, a black-raven shade allowing the eye to see with ample strain. It originates at the end of the tunnel, dark flame unwavering with the shadow, instead becoming a part of it. Torchlight, as demonstrated through the dwindling match, dances with shadow in perfect unison, the glow and darkness just out of reach from one another. This flame, however, is born of darkness, wrapped in shadowy embrace. It\u2019s both light and shadow, visible and unseen.\n\nThe tunnel opens into a small room, a religious place by the looks of it. Small pads and mats rest on the floor, long covered by dust and dirt. A small altar sits in the center. To one side, a single torch hangs on the wall. It\u2019s not made from wood wrapped in oil-soaked cloth. Its handle is a jagged black metal, giving it the appearance of a stem with thorns. The top radiates ravenlight through four blade-like points, the source of its energy remains a mystery.\n\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d you wonder aloud in a whisper.\n\n\u201cHalls of the dead,\u201d Redding answers, surprising you with an answer, and an honest one at that. \u201cA resting place for fallen Blackbirds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not know they were so...religiously organized,\u201d you say glancing around the room. \u201cThe stories say they are uncivilized cannibals. I expected more human sacrifice rather than a reverent temple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are those, rest assured. If it\u2019s savages you\u2019re looking for, there are plenty of those.\u201d Seeing your puzzled face through the dusklight, white teeth appear between Redding\u2019s lips. \u201cOh don\u2019t tell me you assumed the natives were all the same. They have different tribes and practices. True, they are united under \u2018the Raven,\u2019, but each tribe expresses their faith differently. This one is clearly one of their more...civilized ones, if that word can be applied to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are we doing here then?\u201d\n\nThe smile disappears. \u201cThere is an artifact of great power hidden within. One that will turn the tide in the war. It\u2019s crucial that we claim it for ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s so powerful, then why is it hidden among the dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimple. The natives believe it to be cursed.\u201d\n\nCorporal Redding motions you forward. Besides the tunnel, which looks as if it were dug in a hurry, a single door leads out from the small chapel, or whatever the Blackbirds call a place of worship. Redding opens the door, and similar ravenlight fills the hallway. What\u2019s left of the underground structure is likely lit the same; the jagged torch doesn\u2019t show signs of wavering. The thought causes you to pull it from the wall before exiting the chapel. Torch in hand, you step into the hallway.\n\nThe walls are lined with sarcophagi. Redding was literal when he said these were the halls of the dead. The stone resting places are squarely built from the same stone of the crumbling ruins above. Small inscriptions line the top, traveling around the exterior. The lids themselves are smooth, the stone grinded down to a surface like an icy lake. They line the hallway in rows of two, the second row being carved into the wall a few feet above where their counterpart rests on the ground.\n\nYou flash the torch in front of a sarcophagus. The language is unreadable, written in unfamiliar symbols that look more like small pictures than actual words. Despite the visual aid, you still have no idea what is carved into the stone. The military doesn\u2019t exactly teach Blackbird as a second language, although you\u2019re wondering if they should. Your mind quickly draws back to the mission, to the artifact that you are recovering. Curiosity brings you to think of the artifact\u2019s form, whether it\u2019s a tome of secrets, infused item, or a physical weapon. Your guess is a tome as Redding said it\u2019ll turn the tide. Something with such an impact must be the powerful words of a sorcerer written long ago.\n\nDeep in your curiosity, you almost don\u2019t hear it. A crack. The sound of stone breaking apart in the slightest amount of sound is picked up by your ears. The hair on the back of your neck rises, the feeling a sailor gets as the subtle signs of an approaching storm appear. You stop mid-step. Redding does the same. The two of you glance at each other, and you know the same thought is on your mind. Half a second later, you both break into a full spring down the hallway. Crack! Chunks of stone sarcophagi explode into the air with a puff of smoke like fireworks, clouds of smoke hiding the contents from being revealed within. Then you see it. Dark hands gripping the side of their respective sarcophagus, embalming tape hanging from decaying fingers like a stubborn flag unwilling to be torn down long after its citizens are conquered.\n\nThey are slow to rise from their resting place as you sprint past. A few fingers manage to reach out and touch your coat along the way, the unsuccessful reach of a drowning man without floating remnants of a shipwreck near to keep him afloat. However, the end of the hallway is a different story. Dark figures crowd in front of you, gathering more by the second. Dead men and women stand in your way, more behind you no doubt.\n\nYou see them in flashes, your sprint and ravenlight not affording clear vision of the dead.\n\nYou see them in flashes. Their skin hangs loosely from bone, threatening to abandon skeletal structure for the floor with each movement.\n\nYou see them in flashes. Soulless black holes rest where eyes used to be.\n\nYou see them in flashes.\n\nEmpty gaps as mouths.", "action_results": [{"action": "Longsword", "result": "There are too many of them for the double-barrelled flintlock. You need to depend on something more reliable, a weapon with no down time, lest you be overwhelmed. Torch in your left, your right hand pulls the longsword from your shoulder. Its handle is a thin strip of leather spiraled around steel, specially modified to your suiting. Most prefer a soft grip, the ability to hold their weapon with comfort, a grip that muffles the clashing of steel. Not you. The leather strip brings no comfort; it\u2019s only designation is to keep the blade from slipping from grasp. On brisk mornings, you can feel the cold steel as if nothing stood in-between your palm and the metal. Your arm welcomes the impact with each blow, toughened, conditioned by years of training.\n\nThey gather in front of you, no doubt more doing the same behind, a wave of dead men and women ready to crash upon you. You cut through them like a sparrow in the wind, like evening sunlight through a gap in the forest. The undead cannot meet your onslaught, their own bodies betraying them. Brittle bones snap under their weight, collapsing a few to the floor soon to be trampled by the others. The undead moan a dull vibration, long losing the ability to articulate words, the sound pouring from empty gaps where mouths used to be, soon to be silenced by your blade.\n\nCorporal Redding compliments your attack with perfect unison. It\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve fought side-by-side, and your experience shows it. His movements are precise, careful not to exert too much energy. Yours, on the other hand, possess a little more flair, the excitement of youth displayed through your swordsmanship, your body possessing more than enough endurance for such attacks.\n\nNo words are shared between you two, but the assessment is clear. Keep moving. Put down the undead quickly. On their own, the undead don\u2019t give much of a fight, but if allowed to overwhelm you--if they could overrun you with numbers then you would find yourself in a difficult position. They are unarmed and undefended. As soon as you cut down one, another takes their place.\n\nFinally, the end of the hallway appears. The number of undead are dwindling, each swing of your sword adding to the bodies piling up on the floor, a trail left behind you and Redding. You cut down the remaining few in your way.

There is not a single corner to the walls; they wrap around the center like a banner twisting in the wind.

The room is built on a slope, a series of stone steps, leading to the resting place. Unlike the ones encountered before, the lone sarcophagus is intricately engraved, covered completely with writing unknown to you. There\u2019s a weighty silence that accompanies the chamber, one that is felt inwardly, one that makes your heartbeat sound like war drums.\n\n\u201cCare to explain why the dead rise from their graves?\u201d you whisper to Redding.\n\n\u201cProtectors of the artifact,\u201d is his reply.\n\n\u201c...that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nRedding turns to face you. \u201cFine.

Our hands. They\u2019re buried with their lifemates--that\u2019s why there are two resting places created on top of each other. They\u2019re bound to protect the artifact together, lest the souls of their lineage be forfeit. Happy now?\u201d\n\nA fabricated story if you ever heard one. It\u2019s too perfect. A good lie must have an aspect of being a lie, along with elements of truth, of course. Stories can\u2019t address every question. That\u2019s the sign of someone who knows they\u2019ll be prodded--and the preparation made beforehand. Still, it\u2019s a little satisfying if you\u2019re being honest.\n\nYou nod. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nRedding stares at you a moment before turning his head back to the lone grave. \u201cWhat?

You can\u2019t help but count each one, twenty-three in total. The stone sarcophagus sits in front of you. It\u2019s made from a similar dark stone as the others, although it appears to have more of a sparkle. Upon further examination, there is some sort of crystal infused with the stone. They shimmer in tiny specks as if ground crystal was mixed with flowing magma, then shaped to its square shape. At least that\u2019s your best un-educated guest. In reality, it could be something entirely different. Magic, perhaps.\n\n\u201cHelp me with this,\u201d Corporal Redding says, gripping the stone lid with both hands. You do the same, standing opposite of him. It resists at first, and then gives way to your combined strength. With a grinding screech, one that disturbs the silence far greater than your footsteps, the lid slides from its closed position, one end landing on the ground, the other remaining posted against the sarcophagus at a diagonal angle.\n\nNo sooner than the lid hits the ground, a soft thunderclap echoes, the sound completely different than stone hitting the floor. Sound in a visible wave expands from the sarcophagus, as if the ripple of a rock thrown into a pond. Instantly, the ravenlight torches extinguish, sending the room into a darkness far greater than that of any night. Something pierces your mind, nothing you\u2019ve ever felt before.

It makes the assigned reading all the better, familiarity without redundancy.\u201d\n\nAlong the path, one that you know well, a stretch of dirt that runs through an area of the school\u2019s well-landscaped forest, you turn to face Prinn. \u201cOf all the words to describe Master Gavin\u2019s class, \u2018fascinating\u2019 is last on the list.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019d know all about that, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought so.\u201d Prinn turns more serious. \u201cListen, if you need help\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNot this again,\u201d you cut him off. \u201cStudying doesn\u2019t interest me. Although I\u2019m sure my father would throw a feast if I asked him to hire a professional tutor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019d get good food and raise your status in the class. Seems like a no-brainer to me. No offense or anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo offen--\u201d you start to question, then realize his meaning. \u201cDamn you, Prinn.\u201d\n\nYou walk in silence for a few steps. The school campus is built with modern design, tall many windowed buildings, yet there are many small sections of forest that still remain, as if warning Mother Nature herself that she could be conquered and contained. Most, like this one, have small trails known to a few students. Sure as hell beats walking around. Sturdy oak rises around you, their leaves attempting to resist autumn\u2019s invading color.\n\nA voice rings out in the air, different from yours or Prinn\u2019s. \u201cWell, well. What do we have here? The runt and his bookbag carrier.\u201d\n\nFrom behind a tree, three boys step in front of you, the one who spoke, Kelle, the ringleader, stands almost an entire head taller than Prinn and you, as is the case for most boys who hit their growth spurt early. His black hair is shaved close, arm displaying two purple lines.\n\n\u201cAre you lost, Kelle?\u201d Prinn says, adjusting his glasses. \u201cPerhaps looking for a higher test score\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking. I assume you\u2019ve finished tomorrow\u2019s assignment for Master Gavin?\u201d Kelle takes a step towards the two of you.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think,\u201d Prinn states rather than framing a question.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s in your best interest to...study with me. Compare notes.\u201d After a nod, Kelle\u2019s two goons, boys whose names you\u2019ve forgotten, lunge to grab at Prinn. With a yelp far less confident than his quips, Prinn attempts to duck from their grasp. Heat rushes through your body, a white burning within. It spreads, and you feel small beads of sweat begging to appear on your forehead.\n\nYou fan the flame.\n\nInstead of helping Prinn, you focus on the ringleader. It\u2019s no secret that academics aren\u2019t your strong suit, but you\u2019ve learned at least one thing from Master Gavin\u2019s biology lectures: sever the head and the body dies. Your younger self charges straight into Kelle, your shoulder planting into his gut. The force of the blow causes a reactive gasp from the boy\u2019s lips. The two of you go sprawling on the forest floor, dirt kicking up with your impact.\n\nAs soon as you hit the ground, you fire a fist into Kelle\u2019s exposed face. The strike causes his head to snap back and hit the ground beneath him. Before you can land another, his two goons wrap up your arms and force you to your feet, well, to an upright position; they hold you in the air so your feet are barely grazing the forest floor. Kelle, now with a smile, stands on his own strength. A line of blood runs down the side of his face, mixing with dirt. His gray robe is stained. Yours is likely its match.\n\n\u201cWait, we can exchange notes!\u201d Prinn yells from behind you.\n\n\u201cYes we will,\u201d Kelle comments, mindlessly. His attention is focused on you. \u201cAfter I teach a lesson of my own. Perhaps you\u2019ll learn something today after all, no-stripe.\u201d\n\nHis fist hits you in the center of your body, just between where the rib cage is connected. You feel like a bird in flight suddenly losing its feathers, the air taken from you--no longer an ally. Before you can even make sense of the analogy, another blow lands in the exact same place. You would crumple over, you would have from the first punch, but the two goons continue to hold you up. All you muster is a cough as you try to fill your lungs back up with air.\n\nFloating above, watching your young body be beaten, you can think of several avenues of attack. Headbutt to stun, explode in movement, focusing to free one of your arms, then using that arm on the offensive. Instead, you watch another punch land, the memory, the emotional tie is almost physically felt. Watching the scene overhead, you take deliberate breaths, the air suddenly feeling rather thin.\n\nFootsteps.\n\nThey trample through the forest in heavy stomps. Twigs snap. Leaves are ruffled. The shape of a man appears through the trees. Kelle and his goons drop you to the dirt, taking off in the opposite direction, not before throwing a last threat your way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue the \u2018lecture\u2019 later!\u201d\n\nPrinn does his best to catch you, but he is neither quick nor strong. You feel the full impact along with your friend awkwardly trying to help. You push his hands away in response, moving to stand on your own, your right arm clutching at your stomach. Vladimir, your father\u2019s man, appears, the one who was stomping towards your one-sided skirmish.\n\n\u201cYoung master. Prinn,\u201d he speaks.\n\n\u201cSome timing you have,\u201d Prinn answers, pushing a curl from his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll see Kelle expelled for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you won't.\u201d\n\nPrinn glances at Vladimir, surprised.\n\nVladimir answers. \u201cIf our young master here (he nods toward you) can\u2019t keep up with his studies, then his brawn should make up for his \u2018brains,\u2019 for lack of a better term. That is spinnable. Failing in the classroom and failing with schoolmate brawls, well, such a thing is best left hidden.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Kelle can\u2019t be allowed to get away with it,\u201d Prinn says as you pull yourself up without his help.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d you speak in a voice a little louder than a whisper, the intake of air still difficult. \u201cDo you trust me, Prinn?\u201d\n\nHe nods and adjusts his glasses.\n\n\u201cGood. This is what we must do\u2026\u201d\n\nVladimir pretends not to hear you. He walks back towards the direction he arrived. After a few steps he stops and speaks without turning around. \u201cYoung master. Remember what I said. Do not allow anything to trace back to you or your father. He is up for reelection. After all, the people of Magda expect their Judicator to have his family in line.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Wake", "result": "(A man far from home. A traitor within their midst.)\nI\u2019m no traitor!\n(And they\u2019ll believe you? Your blood is their enemy.)\nI\u2019ve served them well enough. My actions speak for themselves.\n(I sense you\u2019re barely convincing yourself, let alone Alteran.)\nIt\u2019ll have to do.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wake", "result": "\u201cKid?\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cKid, wake up. We\u2019re in some shit.\u201d Corporal Redding slaps your face lightly. Your senses are lost, seemingly floating just from your grasp. The slap brings a small fuzziness, the feeling of sleeping on a limb all night. Another slap. Harder this time. The second one helps put things in order, a sharp stinging where the fuzziness was felt. Sight comes next. Corporal Redding\u2019s scraggly beard is inches away from your face, examining your eyes for signs of life. Behind him, the accuracy of his statement settles.\n\nDark raven light in long ribbon-like strands fly across the tomb, filling the place in the glow of dusk, the torches remaining unlit. Light, instead, pours from within the open sarcophagus, its origin. Ravenlight spirals in the air with a soft whistle--one that appears to be picked up one ear at a time, twisting, braiding with one another, a dark purple web with two Alteran soldiers caught at its center.\n\nA shadow hangs heavy in the midst of the ravenlight. The shape of a human body rises from the open sarcophagus, floating in the air the way one would casually lay on lake water, as if an unseen rope binds the body from the waist. It\u2019s in the shape of a man. Hard to tell at first with long strands of black hair, although the shoulders are too broad to be a woman\u2019s. The floating shadow slowly turns upright, like a man sliding out of bed in the morning, his feet hanging mere inches over the sarcophagus.\n\nDead, black orbs for eyes meet yours. His skin looks as if it\u2019s barely attached to his face, as if a quick turn of the head would result in its undoing. The figure is dressed in a tattered robe, purple and black, the robe itself shaped like a swordpoint at the bottom, a gold medallion resting at his chest in contrast to the dark robes beneath. Wrinkly fingers, long lost their healthy color, grip around a wooden staff, carved to proudly display a raven at the top. Like the others, an empty hole sits where a mouth should be, the bottom jaw detached and lost long ago.\n\nA Blackbird high priest, a shaman. A Blackbird lich.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this,\u201d you utter, feeling those seven words sum up the situation perfectly.\n\nWho disturbs the hallowed halls. Who calls the dead from their sleep.\n\nThe lich shows no indication of speaking. His voice simply...is, a deep rumbling like a thousand boots marching to war, like the warning grumble of a volcano before erupting. The lich doesn\u2019t phrase his words in a question. There\u2019s no inflection; each word resonates exactly the same as the others, like the steady groan of the undead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, really. Is there more than one reason anyone would venture here?\u201d Corporal Redding answers, drawing his sword. The lich doesn\u2019t respond to the obvious threat. Perhaps that\u2019s his nature. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t see one.\n\nTo visit the famed resting place and find inspiration for one\u2019s life.\n\nWas that humor? It\u2019s hard to tell with the lich\u2019s featureless demeanor. You could see it as such, although it could be the case that liches are over-the-top serious, a trait likely caused by binding one\u2019s soul to an eternity between life and death, unable to die, yet not quite alive. Yeah, if you took such binding, you\u2019d probably speak in the same manner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here for inspiration,\u201d Redding affirms.\n\nAh. So be it. I accept your challenge, outsider. You will soon join the bones of those who have tried before you. You will be another body lost in a sea, no grave to your name, no memory of your passing. What you think is honorable is nothing more than grasping at the wind.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken again,\u201d Corporal Redding says. \u201cThere\u2019s no honor here. Only the grim reality of what must be done. Now, kid!\u201d\n\nYour hand is resting by your side, feigning a calm demeanor. Hidden underneath is tension, building, stored energy ready to be released. The trick is keeping a blank face--any duelist will tell you that--a slate wiped of all emotion, unwavering. Your expressionless face carefully watched the words spoken between Corporal Redding and the Blackbird lich. Your hand, itching for movement. Your flintlock, desperate to play.\n\nThe familiar grip is placed against your palm.\n\nThe hammer\u2019s distinct click rings into the tomb.\n\nYour eyes are focused on the target, the small amount of space between the lich\u2019s endless-black eyes. He floats just above the sarcophagus, a direct shot. Your eyes do not leave your target, not when you draw the flintlock, not when you press down the hammer, not even as your arm moves to firing position. There lies only the target and your shot. Cool metal presses against the inside of your pointer finger, the trigger pleading to join the fun. You oblige. It takes little more than the strength to scratch your head, the strength required to pluck at a lute. How easily death can come.\n\nFor an instant the tomb\u2019s ravenlight is joined by another source, a small spark, then fiery reddish-orange combustion, followed by black gunfire smoke. Before the hole appears at the lich\u2019s forehead, you know the shot to be true. There\u2019s a feeling that accompanies perfect aim, a premonition of sorts that\u2019s brought about by the muscle memory of countless fires. Any small deviation is felt, a stickiness of the holster, trigger pulled too soon. There is nothing of the sort here. Only pure marksmanship.\n\nOne moment the lich floats above the sarcophagus. The next, a round hole appears between its eyes.\n\nOne moment the lich floats above the sarcophagus. The next, it crashes down, hitting the side wall of the sarcophagus, then collapsing to the tomb floor in a heap of robe, its staff flung from grasp.\n\nOnly then do you allow your gaze to wander. It finds Corporal Redding, who meets your eyes with his own. He doesn\u2019t speak, and neither do you. Redding walks to the fallen lich, blade still drawn. He raises it overhead, and for an instant the lich\u2019s body twitches, a small movement, perhaps as it looks to regather its strength. Redding\u2019s sword cuts down, severing head from body. The lich\u2019s head rolls on the floor a moment before resting against the base of the sarcophagus, gaping hole for a mouth facing you.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d you break the silence. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we take the artifact,\u201d Corporal Redding replies, stepping over the fallen lich to peer inside the sarcophagus. Curious, you follow closely behind him. Peering inside, your eyes take a second to adjust. It\u2019s dark, unnaturally so. A single item lies inside, small of size. Corporal Redding snatches it up with one hand.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s safe?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cKid, nothing in the New World is safe.\u201d\n\nFair enough.\n\nYour attention draws to the item in Redding\u2019s palm. The artifact is in the form of a small dagger. Its hilt is ravenblack and wing-shaped, the point sharper than any talon. The blade itself is a midnight black as if attempting to meld into the shadow cast by the hilt. But still, it\u2019s a dagger. How can Redding expect a dagger, even a deadly one, to turn the tide of the war? You can\u2019t help but voice the thought. At least your mouth opens, the words ready to flow, when Redding beats you to it. Your thoughts must have shown on your face.\n\n\u201cTrust me. This is no ordinary dagger.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\nRedding gives you a patented grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nGreat.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Redding gestures with the dagger. \u201cThe others must be done with their task by now. We have what we came here for, thanks to you.\u201d\n\nYou twirl the flintlock around your finger before sliding it back into the holster at your thigh. \u201cAnother day in the life\u2026\u201d You turn to leave, Redding by your side.\n\n(This day is not done with surprises quite yet.)\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d you ask Redding.\n\n\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d is his answer.\n\nUndead rising from their graves, liches, and now voices: you\u2019re damn glad to leave the place. Never before have you looked forward to returning to a military camp. You could use an ale, perhaps a little music, and a full night\u2019s rest. Bad things supposedly happen in threes. Luckily the same holds true for the good.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave the halls", "result": "You travel the way you came. Back through the hall, stepping over the dead, keeping a steady eye on the fallen to make sure they don\u2019t rise again. Once is enough for you. In the small religious room, you place the ravenlight torch back on the hook where you found it. How polite. How civilized. Two steps into the tunnel, you undo the good deed, needing the light to guide you back to the ladder. There\u2019s no sense in wasting another match or two.\n\nCorporal Redding volunteers to take the ladder first, which you take no argument with. You slump down, back against the tunnel wall, and pause a moment while he climbs up. It\u2019s hard to formulate thoughts on what you just experienced. Necromancy is not unheard of. It\u2019s rare, sure, but it\u2019s not something of myth or fable. It\u2019s just what you weren\u2019t expecting from the natives. The stories in Alteran made them out to be large beasts without the knowledge or intellect for such magic. That\u2019s two occasions now, counting the voyage landing. Mentally you agree to block out such stories going forward. They can only result in underestimating your enemy, something many dead men are guilty of.\n\nMid-thought the rope ladder suddenly sways back and forth. You shelve your thoughts for another time. Now you need to focus on climbing. It\u2019s not a difficult task, but you\u2019d rather remain in the present moment to prevent a fall resulting in broken bones, or worse. Just as you came down, you intentionally go slowly to preserve strength and endurance. After several minutes, you reach the top. An outstretched palm greets you at the top, thrust through the square amount of sunlight shining through the open trap door. Palm meeting palm, you allow Corporal Redding to pull you up.\n\nOnly it\u2019s not Corporal Redding. You arrive face-to-face with a soldier of Magda. Magda, the territory at the High King\u2019s heel.\n\nIn contrast to the long blue overcoat of the Alteran soldier, the soldiers of Magda wear deep crimson tunics, tucked into their pants to allow for their steel breastplates to shine magnificently. You see, their hearts belong to Supreme Leader Fargrave (spit), and they will make sure their leader\u2019s property is well defended. To that effect, each wears a small hand buckler at their waist to pair with a broadsword resting on the opposite hip. This man in particular has sharp features, thin nose, a thin chin seemingly trying to stretch away from his face. His brown hair is slicked back and tied at the base of his neck.\n\nIn reaction to seeing your country\u2019s rival, you allow your other hand to greet the man in return, although yours is in the form of a fist to his jaw. The man crumples to the ground. It\u2019s then that you see the rest of the company bound by rope, more soldiers standing guard nearby. Bastus appears to enjoy your shot, despite the cloth gag tied at his mouth, the approval written in his eyes. Good. At least they\u2019re still alive. Can the same be said for\u2026\n\nCorporal Redding.\n\nHe\u2019s engaged in discussion with the Madga superior officer, showing off the artifact. Since you know the man, you can tell he\u2019s doing his best not to hand over the artifact, subtly gesturing with the dagger as if it were in the hands of the officer. Then again, can you really claim that you know the man? First, the deception with the company. Second, the apparent friendliness towards the soldiers of Magda. Hopefully that\u2019s it. A betting man might toss money towards a third.\n\nYou briefly entertain the idea of drawing your flintlock and firing upon the soldiers. As quickly as the thought appears, it vanishes. You know how that story ends. Two, maybe three soldiers would go down with you. Now\u2019s not the time or place for such heroics. Besides, after the left hook, the soldiers seem to rest their hands a little closer to the hilt of their broadswords. Plus, the High King never gave permission. A punch is excusable. Even a duel with swords is. But outright killing? No, that\u2019s against the rules of civilized war, especially when the Alteran leader hasn\u2019t declared it in the first place. When struggles happen between Alteran and Magda in the Old World, the import and export of POWs become their main business, minus the factories creating weapons of war, of course.\n\nThe soldier you hit rises from the ground, anger visible on his face, one that is turning a crimson to match his tunic. His arm cocks back to return fire. His emotions cause him to wind up, something that all hand-to-hand combat instructors warn against. It\u2019s the easiest punch in the world to dodge, brought upon by untempered emotion and the desire to knock an opponent the fuck out. Such techniques, if you can call it that, are only effective when set up with another strike or with your opponent stunned, dazed, or bound.\n\nTwo sturdy hands grab for each of your arms simultaneously, reminding you, again, of a childhood memory, pinning them against your body, soldiers unseen from behind you. You manage to twist your head to soften the blow, but it still hits, glancing off your cheek. If the man wasn\u2019t angry before, he sure as hell is now, clearly noticing your ability to slip from the solid punch. He winds up again, another slow telegraph, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going anywhere.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d\n\nThe man speaking to Corporal Redding silences the skirmish with two words. Instantly, the soldiers release your arms, the one in front of you bringing both hands to his sides, although you notice his fists are still clenched. The apparent leader of the Magda soldiers walks forward. He\u2019s a large man, but not overly so, possessing natural strength while, perhaps, not displaying the physique in a cut manner. In contrast to Redding\u2019s scraggly beard, the man has his trimmed short and neat, matching the way his black hair is styled.\n\n\u201cThese are our guests, Benjamin. Our allies.\u201d\n\nBenjamin, the soldier you hit protests. \u201cBut he struck first!\u201d\n\n\u201cMerely startled him is all,\u201d Corporal Redding interjects, much to the obvious disapproval of the leader. \u201cThe fault lies with me for not warning him ahead of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\nCorporal Redding now has the scrutiny of the soldiers\u2019 commanding officer, not an unusual thing by any means. What is unusual is that it\u2019s from a Fargrave loyalist.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t share the plan with your most trusted soldier? What if he pulled a sidearm? What if he killed one of my men?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne question at a time. Please, Alexander,\u201d Redding answers. \u201cObviously because it\u2019s my \u2018most trusted soldier,\u2019 I knew what his reaction would be.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hit me,\u201d Benjamin retorts. \u201cDid you know that would happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Alexander, the leader, comes to the aid of his man.\n\n\u201cIt was a coin toss,\u201d Redding says. \u201cAnd to be fair, I knew you\u2019d hit him back, probably worse than you received. Seems I was right about that.\u201d\n\nAlexander simply shakes his head. \u201cRedding you old bastard. You\u2019re still the same unconventional mastermind after all these years.\u201d\n\nAll these years? Those two knew each other before? They must. The turning of one\u2019s coat doesn\u2019t come easily, at least not for a man like Redding who you\u2019ve known for years. He\u2019s never been one for material wealth. No, he considers experience far above possessions and a heavy coin purse.\n\nSuddenly, you realize why he\u2019s taken such an interest in you over the years. It hits you like a crossbow bolt to the chest, an unexpected appearance of a lover, the news of a close friend\u2019s death. He must know your past. A family line born of Magda. That\u2019s the only explanation. Still, you resolve not to disclose damning information that isn\u2019t expressed explicitly. As soon as Alexander bargains with Frontrunner\u2019s Camp, you\u2019ll be back home, or at least the New World equivalent. Best not to whisper anything that will punch your ticket to the gallows.\n\nWhile POWs are easily returned back to their country, spies are hung by the neck. Battling to death in the field of battle is honorable; lying to one\u2019s neighbor and selling country secrets is much the opposite. The fact that the company is alive and witnessing everything, doesn\u2019t speak well for you--even if you might have been at odds with Benjamin. They\u2019ll be returned, spread the story of Redding and his prodigy's betrayal, and a picture of your face will be posted at every tavern, bar, and inn with the amount of money your life is deemed worth.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s settled,\u201d Alexander continues, gesturing towards the Alteran company. \u201cForm up. Ensure those ropes are tight. The garrison is stationed only a few miles from here. But still, I'd like to have a nice and peaceful march there. Can you do that for me, men?\u201d\n\nThe soldiers of Magda shout their agreement along with a salute. Despite your small scuffle, they don\u2019t tie you up. They don\u2019t take your weapons from you. Whatever arrangement Redding made must have included you as one of their turncoats, or spies, or whatever--it doesn\u2019t really matter. Compliance with Magda will result in Alteran marking you for death, and you\u2019re not exactly in the best position to refuse. Still, you\u2019re armed, and the element of surprise can turn the tide, especially if you can free the rest of the company.", "action_results": [{"action": "Comply with Magda", "result": "No, you dare not attempt any sort of rescue. The lives of the company aren\u2019t in any danger. As such, it would be the most selfish thing you could do in the current situation. You would be, essentially, putting their lives at risk in exchange for a pardon in Alteran. How could you face your countrymen, returning back to serve by their side, after doing such a thing. No. The best thing for your fellow soldiers, bound, is to play the part, keeping the lives of the company higher than that of your own.\n\nThe soldiers form up. There are 17 of them total, including Alexander, which means there are 16 under his command. A few more men than in a typical Alteran company. From what you know about the two superpowers, Alteran boasts more overall soldiers. It wouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary for their numbers to be grouped at a higher number than Magda, although that\u2019s not the case--that difference is made up with the sheer number of companies, units, battalions, garrisons, etc. Smaller-knit groups of soldiers learn to work well together, and that cohesion is kept as the High King\u2019s commanders piece them together.\n\nYour mind draws to the scenario of a revolt. Outnumbered, outmatched. It likely wouldn\u2019t go well. Patience. There\u2019ll be a time for confrontation, and you\u2019d rather it be when the soldiers of Magda think you among them, docile, like a declawed pet. The soldiers of Magda line up, four rows of four. Alexander takes the front along with Redding. They motion for you to join them. Putting on your best friendly face, you join them.\n\n(Like a declawed pet, indeed.)\n\nThere it is again, the voice. You decide to answer back, in your head, of course. The situation is already dicey enough without you convincing both friendly and enemy soldiers alike that you\u2019re not quite right in the mind.\n\nWho\u2019s there? Can you hear me?\n\nSilence for a moment. You begin to feel like a fool. Then, a response.\n\n(Quite the interesting conundrum you\u2019ve found ourselves in.)\nOurselves?\n(You and I are in this together. So, yes, \u2018ourselves.\u2019)\nWho are you?\n(You\u2019ll find out soon enough.)\n\nWith that the voice goes silent, and honestly, you\u2019re glad of that fact. You march at the front, knowing exactly what it signifies. It means you're technically the superiors of the Magda soldiers that fall in line behind you, or at the very least you\u2019re considered a \u201cguest,\u201d \u201cally,\u201d whatever--the soldiers can\u2019t cross you without disobeying their commanding officer. The Magda company, along with yours, tied up and bound, travel through the overgrowth of the New World.", "action_results": [{"action": "Make conversation", "result": "The march is largely silent except for the sounds you\u2019d expect, stomping of boots, the constant rattling of swords in their sheathes, the heavy breathing of Mada soldiers wearing full breastplates. You\u2019re glad to have nothing but leather: wearing steel while traveling through difficult terrain feels like a command gone wrong. Still, you don\u2019t know the environment. Your feeling would be the opposite if a Blackbird ambush occurred.\n\n\u201cSo, kid. You must have questions,\u201d Redding says without turning towards you.\n\nYou have enough discretion to speak knowing your audience, more specifically, the Magda commanding officer standing mere feet away. \u201cI always have questions,\u201d you say. \u201cYou know that. So we have the dagger. We\u2019ve joined up with the...others. What\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy, my, Redding. You do like to compartmentalize. You\u2019ve been under the leadership of Alteran for far too long,\u201d Alexander comments.\n\nRedding, of course, ignores the man, even though he\u2019s the commanding officer. Old friends, they are, which affords him a long leash, not that Redding ever needed slack doing his own thing. \u201cSurely you have some sort of idea with what I\u2019ve disclosed.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no use arguing with the man. You indulge. \u201cWe\u2019ve journeyed to the New World, a place where the laws of the Old seem to be guidelines at best. We\u2019ve been tasked with patrolling ancient Blackbird ruins, which I\u2019m not certain is even an Alteran direct command at this point. But that doesn\u2019t really matter either way since news of your--our--\u2019change of plans\u2019 will reach Frontrunner\u2019s Camp regardless. We\u2019ve discovered a secret weapon in the halls of the dead, defeating its guardian in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. You have a firm grip on reality,\u201d Redding dryly comments.\n\nYou give him the same treatment that he just gave Alexander. \u201cThere must be a different sort of war taking place on the New World soil, one that wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the Old. The rules of war differ here.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, good. Now keep going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dagger will turn the tide somehow. Without knowing exactly what it does, what it is, it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen next. Perhaps an utter dismantling of Alteran presence in the New World, although that may be thinking too large a scale.\u201d\n\nRedding and Alexander glance at one another. Redding speaks first. \u201cTold you he was worth having.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed you did,\u201d Alexander idly says.\n\nThey don\u2019t share any further detail, but their approval must mean that you\u2019re spot-on with your speculation. The rest of the journey is traveled in silence, save for the sounds of boots, swords, and breathing.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Magda garrison", "result": "Alexander wasn\u2019t lying when he said the garrison was close. It doesn\u2019t even take a day\u2019s journey before it appears. In a section of the forest that loosens up on density, the New World Magda garrison joins the scattered trees with large wooden walls. Unlike Frontrunner\u2019s, which holds true to its camp-like layout, the garrison boasts sturdy walls, fashioned from layers of sharpened timber. Those daring enough to climb them risk impalement as the walls are like that of shark teeth, several rows, the next rising a bit higher than the previous.\n\nYour instant reaction is that the Magda presence in the New World is much more established than the Alterans. Either that or they have the appearance of it, which is almost as good in your opinion. The color of the walls are the same as the jungle that surrounds it, likely meaning the clearing was man-made. Trees felled in order to be carved, sharpened, and placed exactly where their roots are currently decomposing in the dirt beneath.\n\nA horn rings through the trees, a deep rumble like a wild animal challenging another. One of the soldiers behind you answers with his own. Much more established indeed. The gate to the garrison is reinforced wood. Upon your return horn, voices shout from within the fort, commands being issued. A moment later the gate draws up, men from inside turning a pulley system.\n\n\u201cPut them in the dungeon,\u201d Alexander waves to a group of soldiers in greeting. They salute, and take the bound and gagged Alterans to an unseen location. \u201cYou two. Come with me.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t wait to see if you\u2019re following. Alexander turns and takes off through the garrison. Redding, shrugging towards you, follows closely behind. Without any immediate superiors watching, you allow a sigh to escape your lips, one that\u2019s been building for several hours now. The prisoner exchange better happen sooner than later. You\u2019re not thrilled with the idea of your fellow soldiers remaining behind bars. Just because they are spared their lives, doesn\u2019t mean the holding situation is any level of comfortable.\n\nThe inside of the garrison is filled with many buildings built from the same wood. They\u2019re square, compact. Most of the windows are simply open, metal bars running across as to prevent unwanted entry, similar to the way the walls are sharpened. If there\u2019s one thing for certain, the Magda garrison is controlling about who they let in or out. Several groups of crimson-clad soldiers, decked with steel breastplates, march by. You roughly estimate the garrison holds a little more than half of the population of Frontrunner\u2019s, but they\u2019re obviously more supplied and defended, each leader of the Old World having different avenues of conquest in the New.\n\n---\n\nThe next day your meeting with Alexander continues. Reuniting in the courtyard, he, once again, expects you and Redding to follow him. After passing by more buildings, Alexander stops at one, compact and square like the others, only this one is composed of many stories. There\u2019s at least five, six of them, each level probably not more than two rooms each by looks of the foundation. Makes sense. Space is limited inside a fort. If you can\u2019t build out, you build up. Alexander nods at the soldier posted at the door, a man with a jaw as square as the building he\u2019s guarding. The soldier offers no friendly nod to you or Redding, merely stares at your approach. The three of you enter inside.\n\nSoft magelight greets you with a crimson glow, matching the shade of the Magda tunic. It\u2019s a library. Bookshelves line the walls and fill the center in rows. Off to the far wall rest a few small desks, each with a small mage lamp sitting on top. The library is partially populated. Scribes by the look of it. Rather than steel breastplates, the inhabitants wear flowing robes, most with small gold-rimmed spectacles hanging from the tip of their nose. They pay you no mind; their research takes all of their attention.\n\n\u201cUp here,\u201d Alexander whispers, as not to disturb the peace, motioning towards a ladder. Seems a staircase takes up too much room. The three of you climb a, coincidentally, three stories before stepping into a mostly open room, this one built like a study. A large desk takes the center. Surrounding it are, of course, bookshelves and open cabinets to store loose scrolls. \u201cThis used to be the top floor, my personal study, \u201cAlexander explains with more volume to his voice. \u201cBut we needed more room, and thus, a few more stories were added. Command still can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t move to the top floor.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s any influence of Redding on the man, there it is. You silently wonder if more will be revealed as you get to know the man. Alexander sits down behind the desk, his large frame keeping up with the piece of furniture. The man himself, Redding, spots a small table at the far end of the study with a wine pitcher. He strides over and pours two cups, handing one to you, knowing that Alexander would refuse the offer. Cup in hand, you settle into the two guest seats, large lounge chairs, occupying the front of the desk.\n\n\u201cShow it to me again,\u201d Alexander speaks again.\n\nRedding shifts, drawing the dagger from his belt. Ravenblack. Winged-shaped handle. He sets it on the desk in front of him, noticeably not sliding it across towards Alexander. With the same unenthusiastic reaction that you held, Alexander continues speaking. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like much. This is what those natives have been throwing their lives at to protect?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the lives of those already fallen.\u201d Redding answers. \u201cBut they dare not disturb the ruins. Luckily, I\u2019m--we\u2019re--not bound by such superstition.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does it work?\u201d Alexander asks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d Redding says with a grin, one that quickly fades.\n\n\u201cNo. You\u2019ll show me now.\u201d\n\n(To be used for party tricks, am I?)\n\nStraight-faced you ignore the voice.\n\n(Your commander is in for a surprise.)\nHe\u2019s not a commander; he\u2019s a corporal.\n(So he does know how to answer.)\n\nRedding and the voice are interrupted. A Magda runner, out of breath, enters the study. Young boy with a face a similar shade of red as his tunic. \u201cThey\u2019re gathering again. More than we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d\n\nAlexander waves his hand dismissively. \u201cTake the 12th and 19th. Two should be enough to handle a simple raiding party.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think you realize. It\u2019s not a raiding party. It\u2019s a war party.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Blackbird war party", "result": "\u201cAlright, son. You have my attention. Spill it all out,\u201d Alexander commands.\n\n\u201cOuter scouts have caught sight of a large number of Blackbirds, much larger than any raiding party we\u2019ve come across so far.\n\n\u201cYes, yes. You said that already, boy. How many are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cScoutleader Prinn discovered them. They snuck through our first perimeter, somehow. They meld into the forest, even with such a large amount.\u201d\n\n(Prinn!) You notice he\u2019s not \u201cScholar\u201d or \u201cScribe\u201d Prinn.\n\n\u201cHow many, boy. I won\u2019t ask again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least a thousand,\u201d the messenger whispers. His voice slightly cracks with the word.\n\n\u201cGods. They must have unified tribes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Corporal Redding starts. \u201cYou wanted me to demonstrate the artifact\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll get the opportunity in a practical setting. You two,\u201d Alexander points at Redding and you. \u201cChange out of that Alteran garb. We don\u2019t need any accidents on the battlefield. Find the quartermaster. Tell him I sent you. And you, boy,\u201d Alexander turns to the messenger. \u201cRun to Lieutenant Benjamin at the gate. Tell him to hold and await my orders.\u201d\n\nWith a salute, the messenger leaves. You and Redding take off after him down the ladder. You find that you\u2019ve had your fill of ladders for the near future. The messenger points out the quartermaster\u2019s post before heading for the gate. Soldiers are running about in pairs to join their formations. It\u2019s not a unique system; each soldier has a designation \u201cwar companion\u201d to help with armor, ensure each other gets to formation in time, etc. Command can\u2019t keep track of every individual soldier, so that task is delegated between the soldiers themselves. The fort must have been warned of your arrival, but stil, many passing Magda soldiers give you strange looks, no doubt looking at your Alteran uniform.\n\nYou enter the quartermaster\u2019s post, a small square building, unsurprisingly, and a burly man with a thick chestnut moustache greets you with the barrel of a flintlock, clicking the hammer back almost as soon as the door closes.\n\n\u201cGods, you startled me, gentlemen,\u201d the quartermaster speaks through a voice that is present in taverns everywhere. \u201cYou must be Captain Alexander\u2019s \u2018associates.\u2019 What\u2019ll it be, uni, weapons, armor?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the tunics for now. And any leather you have lying around,\u201d Redding answers.\n\n\u201cLeather, hmm. I might have some lying around,\u201d the quartermaster rubs his chin. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want steel?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe leather will work fine,\u201d you reinforce Redding\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cAlright then. It\u2019ll work fine until an arrow pierces right through. I\u2019ll see what I\u2019ve got, hmm.\u201d The quartermaster leaves into an open doorway behind him, likely equipment storage. A little while later, which feels a lot longer than it actually was given the present circumstance, he returns with two crimson tunics and boiled-leather chestplates, along with matching bracers. \u201cSee how these fit.\u201d\n\nYou drop the deep blue overcoat, now in less-than-pristine condition after trudging through the jungle, not to mention the Blackbird halls of the dead. The tunic slides on easily enough, although its shade is a bit too bright for your liking. Like the other soldiers, you tuck the tunic into your trousers and slide the armor on top, your longsword being the finishing touch, traveling from right shoulder to left hip.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll have to do,\u201d the quartermaster ponders aloud, still rubbing his chin in thought. \u201cAt the very least you don\u2019t have to worry about one of your allies stabbing you in the back by accident.\u201d He laughs, yet you remain straight-faced. The implication of the joke, although unintentional, is clear to a man who just discarded his soldier\u2019s uniform for another. \u201cNow off with you. There\u2019s no savages to kill here.\u201d\n\nLooking the part of the Magda soldier, you leave the quartermaster\u2019s office. Alexander didn\u2019t give you official orders, but there\u2019s only one place to be. The war party gathers outside the fort. You follow the soldiers gathering near the gate. Horns, possessing a similar cry as during your arrival, ring in the air, filling in the gaps between boots crunching the earth underneath. A sea of red washes towards the gate, the dam, battle-ready. Somber is the mood, the thing of seasoned warriors. There\u2019s no excitement. No one who\u2019s tasted battle yearns for it, at least those who still carry the mind of a sane man.\n\nNot having strict orders, a command, a unit--you name it, you and Redding take position near the eastern wall, at the corner, where it connects with the main gate. You stand still for a moment, not wanting to be in anyone\u2019s way, then you notice space on the rampart. A switchback staircase later (you\u2019re surprised it\u2019s not a ladder) and you find yourself overlooking the would-be battlefield. It\u2019s not a clear view; the forest blocks most of your view.\n\nThen like the creeping blackness of dawn, they appear.\n\nShadows, the figure of men, creep from behind trees, ducking underneath vines. Unlike the Blackbird woman you found yourself face-to-face with, every instinct screams enemy! Sinister, they are. A formless mass of warriors. Even from your vantage they appear large in stature. Rumors tend to embellish; not in this case. Like the stories say, the natives stand a full head taller than the average Alteran. Suddenly, the light leather you wear doesn\u2019t seem as protective. Still, it\u2019s the armor you\u2019re used to fighting in. You\u2019re silently glad that the company is locked up away from sight. One, they are bound and defenseless. Two, they can\u2019t see you wearing the colors of the High King\u2019s rival.\n\nThe sea of soldiers part, and Alexander strides forward, his feathered steel helm underneath one armpit. On the ramparts, archers still survey the battlefield, although you can tell their focus is on their captain as well, like the trained ears of a mother when a child acts out. Their arrows are nocked but not yet drawn. Alexander takes the staircase, and at the top, a figure meets him. You\u2019re surprised you didn\u2019t see him before. Unlike the other soldiers, the figure is dressed in a forest green cloak, which boasts a sizable collar, rising to the tip of the figure\u2019s nose. A bow and quiver lies on the figure\u2019s back, one of fine craftsmanship, far past the quality of the archers next to you.\n\nAlexander addresses the soldiers. Seems a speech before battle is a custom in Magda as well.\n\n\u201cMen of the Supreme Leader, today you will bring honor to Magda. You\u2019ve fought and defeated the savages of this land many times already. There may be a greater number of them now, an entire war party, but that makes your victory for the Supreme Leader even greater. The first victory has already been won. They expected to find us unawares. They thought they could show up on our doorstep and barge inside. That is not the case, the furthest thing from the case. Scoutleader Prinn here (Alexander puts his hand on a green cloaked shoulder) discovered the savages\u2019 plot, tracked them. Scoutleader--\n\n--Prinn takes another look at your crudely drawn battle plans in the dirt. It\u2019s nothing more than a simple line with an arrow pointing in its side, signaling \u201cambush.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, adjusting his glasses. \u201cIt might just piss them off even more.\u201d\n\nYour younger self smiles. \u201cInteresting choice of words there. Oh it will piss them off for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure it won\u2019t come back on us?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean splash damage?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cFairly certain. You\u2019re the one that built the pressure plates anyway.\u201d You sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll be wearing masks. Unless they catch us and tear them from our face, they\u2019ll never know. They\u2019ll assume, sure. But they won\u2019t have any evidence.\n\nPrinn smiles. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope there aren\u2019t any in-depth investigations as to the series of chamber pots that have gone missing. \u2018Constable Marburry And The Case Of The Missing Chamber Pot.\u2019\u201d\n\nChildlike laughter escapes your lips. \u201cHow the hell are you the smartest in our class?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s filled with students like yourself.\u201d\n\nYou throw a punch into the boy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThey should be coming down here soon. Kelle always takes this route after lecture to save time.\u201d\n\nThe two of you, wearing green cloaks to blend in with the forest, hunker down behind a tree. A silence ensues, one that often appears before combat, not that you recognized it at the time. A little while later footsteps, faintly, fill the forest air, growing louder with each step. Kelle and his two goons come into view, wearing their school robes.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d you whisper to Prinn, sliding a black cloth mask over your face.\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d is his reply, also covering his face.\n\nYour hands grab for the basket of spoiling vegetables sitting next to you, a squishy tomato ends up in your palm, a rotten apple in Prinn\u2019s. Motioning your head to signal now! the two of you break from your hiding place, arms cocked back like a professional Runball player. Shock. Freeze. Kelle and his two goons don\u2019t know how to react to the sudden ambush, another lesson you would learn in the military. Your tomato explodes in a splash of red, leaving a juicy impact on Kelle\u2019s robes, the splash damage hitting his face as well. That seems to bring them back to reality, just in time for Prinn\u2019s rotten apple to hit one of the goons, splattering like a wine jar falling from the table.\n\nSurprise turns to anger. \u201cYou both are dead!\u201d Kelle shouts. You take the chance to throw another rotting vegetable his way before turning and high-tailing it deeper into the forest, Prinn already far ahead. Your vision becomes a blur of trees, leaves, and branches, coming into existence just in time for you to blow by. Your breath is heavy. But still you run, adrenaline pumping through your veins, scared, yet thrilled at the rush of emotion, half of them you probably couldn\u2019t even describe. This is true living, not sticking your nose in a book for ten hours a day.\n\nYou run the course, Kelle after you, not knowing the designed route. You pass by a sturdy oak, then a sapling, then a fallen tree. The fallen tree. It lies across the path, covering the other side, framed by overhanging branches. A perfect tunnel. A perfect place for a trap. Instead of leaping over the fallen trunk, you use your momentum to kick off the trunk. Your body flies high in the air, far quicker than when you practiced--a result of fearing for your life versus simply training.\n\nThere\u2019s a sturdy branch off to the side of the path, one whose sister branch bears a series of chamber pots that \u201cmysteriously\u201d went missing from the school. Before you have time to register your flight, your chest smacks into the branch, and you barely manage to wrap your arms around it. As you pull yourself up, the pressure of your grip shaves bark from the branch, and like a loose handhold for a rock climber, it goes tumbling down to the ground, you soon to be shortly after--\n\n--A hand clasps with yours. Prinn! He\u2019s already in the tree, one arm outstretched, his blonde curls in his eyes, but he does not dare attempt to adjust it. He\u2019s not strong enough to pull you up, but he halts your downward momentum, allowing you to slowly climb back up. Before you can thank him, footsteps, pressure plate. The mechanism tethered to the sister branch flips, and several, full, chamber pots overturn, spilling their contents onto three young boys below.\n\nFirst, again, surprise. Then rage, far beyond the reaction to rotten vegetables thrown their way, rage in only a way a young boy can express with the inability to formulate coherent sentences, simply guttural sounds mixed with tears, the rage of a boy who doesn\u2019t understand the present situation, yet feels white hot blood pumping through his veins. Thick brown liquid slides down the side of Kelle\u2019s face, mixing with tears. Their rage causes them to pick up rocks. While you threw soft, spoiling fruit, they choose fist-sized stones, upping the ante.\n\nLike a thick hailstorm, a wave of projectiles fly towards you. Exposed, without anywhere to hide, you're a victim to their assault. One hits you in the shoulder, another glances from your forehead. Prinn gets the same treatment. If you stay put, you\u2019re dead, so to speak. If you jump, at least there\u2019s a running chance. Silently you curse, using a word that you\u2019ve heard your father whisper when he thought he was alone. Your plan ended with dumping the chamber pot contents on Kelle. Damn you for not thinking past that. With a cry, Prinn falls from the branch, a large rock doing more than glancing from his brow, his mask knocked from his face, glasses, cracked and bent, knocked from his head.\n\nPrinn!\n\n--and it\u2019s because of his bravery, and loyalty to our Supreme Leader Fargrave that we are prepared to meet the savages head-on. Gods bless the Scoutleader Prinn. Gods bless Supreme Leader Fargrave. Gods bless Magda!\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s speech ends and draws you from the memory. The Scoutleader, Prinn, standing next to Alexander looks nothing like the scrawny boy you remember. You wonder if he\u2019ll recognize you. Probably not. It\u2019s been many years, just over a decade. People change. They attempt to keep up with the wheel of time, putting up a good fight, but never end up victorious. Over the years it weighs on a person. They grow wrinkled and ache in places they\u2019ve never noticed before. It happens to a degree when leaving childhood behind, and is magnified tenfold in less than that many decades. The man that stands before you is proud and strong, confident, the exact opposite of his childhood self. His blonde hair is buzzed and there\u2019s no sign of his glasses.\n\nAfter his speech, Alexander meets with several of his officers. Prinn\u2019s gaze lands on you.\n\n(Is that recognition?)\n\nHe strides atop the ramparts to where you and Redding stand. You notice his eyes don\u2019t shift from side to side, they don\u2019t watch his boots as he walks. They are focused directly on his targets: you. Prinn stops just in front of you. Up close you see he wears light leather underneath his cloak, and his belts--one at his waist two across the chest--are covered with pockets for storing small items. Gone is his boyhood face, replaced with a hardened face of a man who\u2019s faced the realities of combat. He does not introduce himself, speaking a question is more of a statement.\n\n\u201cYou possess the artifact.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Redding answers.\n\n\u201cGood. We\u2019ll have a...special assignment in the battle. Come with me.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with him", "result": "Prinn leads you back down the switchback staircase. As your foot hits the last step, you hear the distinct sound of bowstring thwungs! a volley of arrows sent raining down on the gathering natives. If you didn\u2019t experience the rough landing to the New World that you did, you would think them foolish and unprepared for the battle. From your brief glimpse on the ramparts, they didn\u2019t appear to have any siege weapons with them, nor (ugh) ladders to scale the walls of the fort. Still, somehow they managed to sink Alteran vessels moving in the water. A stationary fort, though with strong walls, may be at the mercy of such firepower. And despite Magda\u2019s well-equipped garrison, you didn\u2019t see any cannons or counter-siege weapons of their own. They may have a defensive fort, but their power is severely lacking. An Alteran fort of this size would have no less than 10 guns pointing down the road to the single gate. Sticks and stones may break bones, but cannonfire puts an end to the discussion.\n\nBack through the main yard, past a few square buildings, Prinn silently leads you without a word. Redding doesn\u2019t seem to be willing to break the silence either, likely both are listening to the battle sounds, determining the events by sound alone. Another thwung! A second volley is loosed at the natives. They\u2019ll be cut down before even reaching the garrison walls. Finally, Prinn stops at an, uncoincidentally, square building. He opens the single door, and waves you inside.\n\nThe battle sounds are deadened here. It\u2019s the top level of a jail. A lone Maga soldier sits behind a table next to a reinforced locked door. The soldier looks up upon your arrival, his face glowing orange from the single candle burning on the table, dangerously close to a thick ledger. If this is the dungeon where the company is being kept, it\u2019s aptly named.\n\n\u201cAppointment,\u201d the guard speaks.\n\n\u201cPrinn, Scoutleader, two guests,\u201d Prinn states back.\n\n\u201cMhm. Mmhmm. Ah,\u201d the guard scans the ledger with one finger, oblivious to the battle happening just outside the front door. \u201cHere we are. Prinn, Scoutleader. Two guests.\u201d The guard stands, a long drawn-out sigh escaping his lips. From his belt, he pulls a sizable keyring. You imagine if one more key were placed on the ring, it would burst apart. However, the guard pulls the exact one he\u2019s looking for with the first draw. He unlocks the door, and like Prinn just moments ago, waves you inside.\n\n\u201cEnjoy your stay. Two feet from the cells, please.\u201d\n\nThe three of you enter the dungeon. You notice the door gets locked behind you. Worst comes to worst and you need a way out, it won\u2019t be the way you just came. Somehow you think a \u201cguest\u201d doesn\u2019t have much leverage behind locked doors. Prinn grabs a torch hanging on the wall, a normal burning one, unlike the one you carried in the halls of the dead. Shadows dance just out of reach as you\u2019re led down the narrow corridor.\n\nCell doors pass on either side, the torch highlighting their barred frames. Most are empty. Some have thin creatures squatting in the corner, which you catch mere glimpses of, far away from the door itself. The dungeon is orderly, so much in fact that the High King might tip his crown to the way it\u2019s run. Whoever resides here has long since been conditioned not to approach anyone walking out their door. Still, you don\u2019t take any chances and keep more than an arm\u2019s reach away.\n\nUpon reaching the final cell door, Prinn reaches inside his cloak and produces a key. It\u2019s not one he gained from the jailer as you never saw them exchange any such thing. The cell creaks open, disturbing the ominous quiet, yet adding to the uneasy feeling that\u2019s accompanying such a place as this. Prinn strides inside, and you can only keep following.\n\n\u201cSo this\u2019s what\u2019s become of you, eh?\u201d\n\nYou turn to find Bastus leaning against his cell door, directly across from the one that Prinn opened. His beard is matted with some sort of liquid, too thick to be water. It\u2019s been but a day, and yet the man looks entirely different than he did the previous morning. Only dressed in a loincloth, the large man looks thinner than before. Your mind tells you weight isn\u2019t lost that easy, but your eyes see another story.\n\nYou choose your words carefully as Redding and Prinn are within listening distance. \u201cI do as I must. That\u2019s all any man can do.\u201d\n\nLaughter spills from within the beard. It causes liquid to shake from Bastus\u2019 chin, like a mongrel after retrieving a bone from a body of water. \u201cThe lie told by a traitor, the one he tells himself is true.\u201d\n\nYou do not know what to say. Any defense will raise questions with Prinn and Redding. The thought briefly enters your mind that you could drop them now; the Alteran standard flintlock is double-barreled, after all. You could then lead the company back to Frontrunner\u2019s Camp with the Magda garrison busy dealing with the Blackbirds.\n\nNo.\n\nFor the same reason you didn\u2019t risk escape earlier. Bastus may be treated poorly, but his life isn\u2019t at risk. The murder of two Magda members would set the garrison aflame with burning vengeance. They would hunt you down. Better to wait for the POW exchange. Do things the proper way. For now, you\u2019ll just have to endure and carry on as normal.\n\n(Quite the young hero we have here. I wonder if they would do the same in your position.)\nDoesn\u2019t matter.\n(Oh it matters, whether you\u2019re willing to admit it or not.)\n\nAs you enter the cell, you leave Bastus with final words. \u201cThere is much that happens outside our narrow view.\u201d You cross into the open doorway, Bastus cackling at your back, likely more liquid sprayed in the air. The cell is meant for one, maybe two prisoners. It\u2019s empty, however, save for your two companions. Chains hang from the wall, a pair of them, answering the question of how many prisoners would occupy it. The walls are square stones. So far, the dungeon has been the only structure in the garrison built from more than lumber. Steel reinforced doors and cell walls; now stone, as the interior. Which begs the question, why are we--\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why we\u2019re here,\u201d Prinn says, barely louder than a whisper, the voice two parents would make over a sleeping child. \u201cThere\u2019s an escape route of sorts dug into these walls. It leads to an underground tunnel that will take us just beyond the assembling natives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think the glorious scoutleader would be interested in running from a battle,\u201d Redding digs.\n\n\u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d Prinn answers, taking the opposite approach of Redding. \u201cWhich is the most effective way to swing a sword?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve heard the saying before. \u201cWhen your enemy least expects it.\u201d\n\nPrinn nods. \u201cExactly.\u201d Then his eyes narrow. \u201cHave we met before?\u201d\n\nPanic floods through your body. As with any lie, the words must be spoken with full confidence. \u201cI think I\u2019d remember meeting a scoutleader in the Supreme Leader\u2019s military.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I a turncoat to his country.\u201d\n\n(Shouldn\u2019t he be more happy with the color of your coat?)\nInfinitely so.\n(He meant it as an insult.)\nI\u2019m well aware.\n(Why didn\u2019t you tell him of your past?)\nThe company is within earshot. Besides, the past is the past. Besides, why am I answering you?\n(Because you\u2019re used to me in your head.)\n\nNot a reassuring thought--words--whatever. You suppose the voice is right. It does feel more normal, at least as normal as a mysterious voice in your head can be. Hopefully the \u201cconversations\u201d stay normal, and you don\u2019t have the voice tempting you to commit a deed that will end up putting your body in a place such as this, permanently.\n\nThe click of a switch, and one section of the wall reveals a small tunnel. Prinn goes first, Redding closely behind. As you enter, leaving the company behind locked up, you silently hope there aren\u2019t any more ladders that await you, although reality has a funny way of spoiling the wine in your wineskin.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "There\u2019s only enough space to travel single file, so you take your place in the rear. The tunnel is barely high enough for you to walk without crouching, though that\u2019s mostly because your head is in a constant dip. After a while, the strain starts to tense up your neck, like that of sleeping at an awkward angle. One foot in front of the other, matching the pace of the boots in front of you, your mind starts to wander\u2026\n\nHe falls from the branch, just out of reach from your grasp. Your childhood hand swipes at the open air. He falls gazing up at you, mouth wide open in a mixture of horror, surprise, and pain, both hands outstretched for your hand that missed by a fair margin. With a deadening smack, Prinn meets the forest floor like a pile of books discarded after a long lecture. His glasses, broken and cracked, hang loosely from the tip of his nose, the rock knocking his mask completely from his face.\n\nThree boys approach your fallen friend. Three boys, riled beyond all belief, revenge on their minds. Righteous revenge. The damage they mean to inflict is warranted. Justified. You see it in their eyes, glossy and unfocused on anything but Prinn\u2019s fallen body. A flintlock could fire a few feet away, and it wouldn\u2019t register in their minds. It\u2019s your plan that brought you here; the damage to Prinn, on you.\n\nYour boots hit the ground next to your fallen friend.\n\n\u201cKnowing the runt\u2019s identity is as good as knowing yours,\u201d Kelle speaks, his words like a blacksmith\u2019s flame. \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours too.\u201d\n\nYou pull the mask from your face. Your young mind is aware of what must take place next, and the face covering will only get in the way, blocking out portions of your peripheral vision. Slowly, Prinn rolls over and pushes himself up, managing to stand by bracing himself on one of your arms.\n\n\u201cDareisay, Kelle, piss on your cheek, shit in your hair, and it only improves your looks.\u201d\n\nIn a situation such as this, only Prinn would offer insults. Though to be fair, he offers them in almost any situation. Reminded of the chamber pots, rather than the identity reveal, Kelle\u2019s teeth grimace, both hands balling into fists, joined by four others.\n\nYou raise your own fists defensively. \u201cCome on then. Unless you\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nThat angers Kelle more than Prinn\u2019s jab. Nothing sets a young boy who fancies himself a young man off like calling him afraid. Good. As one yourself, you\u2019re not surprised when Kelle charges forward, abandoning his superior numbers to a reckless rage. He winds up to throw all his power into a single right hand, telegraphing it in the process. Even untrained boys are able to dodge something as that, which you, in fact, are.\n\nKelle\u2019s arm swings high. You duck underneath and pivot to the side, managing to shove Prinn out of the way in time. Kelle\u2019s charge takes him past you, back exposed, and for a brief moment everything is clear. You\u2019re aware of each of your opponents as well as Prinn, who probably couldn\u2019t take any on his own. The only way out is to end the skirmish quickly. Otherwise, the boys would regroup and use their superior numbers and strength. It\u2019s not honorable. It\u2019s not pretty. You surely wouldn\u2019t brag about it afterward.\n\nYou muster all your strength into a single kick. Your shin lands in-between Kelle\u2019s legs.\n\nKelle\u2019s hands reactively grab for his crotch as he crumples to the ground, fetal, knees tucked into his chest. Before you can celebrate your victory, as minor as it is, Kelle\u2019s goons rush to his aid. If you took the time, you\u2019re sure you could remember their actual names, but their importance is equal to the amount of time you spent remembering. They\u2019re followers, lifelong \u201cyes\u201d men, too afraid to speak their mind, hiding behind their leader\u2019s power and pretending it\u2019s their own. But still, they\u2019re boys, boys who bear the same rage from your prank, boys who are larger than you and Prinn.\n\nOne of them tackles Prinn to the ground in a flurry of dust, the contents of the chamber pot mixing with Prinn\u2019s cloak and exposed skin. The other heads directly for you meaning to use the same tactic, strength over skill, both of which you are severely lacking as a boy. Your enemy charges, both arms outstretched to wrap you up. He\u2019s a wild animal, a crazed bull, a body long absent from his mind, thanks to the ambush. His thoughts are primal. He sees a threat, and he charges, giving his own well-being not a second thought.\n\nBefore the boy can reach you, a match is lit within your mind. Within the timeframe, less even, of a single step towards you, a new feeling overwhelms your senses in a rush, like standing on a rooftop and feeling the wind against your body. The present moment may suggest you\u2019re in the wrong, dumping waste on top of three boys, but the struggle started long ago, and not by you or Prinn. Kelle and his goons have been a thorn, no, more than a thorn in your side for the entire year; they\u2019ve been a bramble thicket growing rampantly across your path. There\u2019s but one remedy: they must be cut out, uprooted.\n\nA fire burns within you, not as untamed flames in a forest devouring all in grasp. It\u2019s a focused beam of energy, a harnessed energy that you can draw from, tuning the mind and pouring strength to your limbs. Rage fills your body, and unlike the three boys, you master it, control it. The rage serves you, not the other way around. You bend it to your will the way a horse tamer breaks a wild stallion. You may not be the smartest, nor the physically strongest either. But the fire burns, stoked to last far greater than any other. The intelligent are powerless when they encounter someone more intelligent, the strong with someone stronger. You are not burdened by such flaws.\n\nThe boy closes within striking range. You keep a sturdy base in your feet. At the last second, you tuck your chin and line your forehead up with the bridge of the boy\u2019s nose. A sickening crunch echoes, even above the sounds of the skirmish. A geyser of red appears on the boy\u2019s face, mixing with the contents of the chamber pot. His momentum still carries into you, however, and the two of you go tumbling to the ground. The fire focuses you. Before you even hit the ground, you\u2019re scratching, throwing short punches. After a few rolls, both of you trying to gain the upper hand, you end up on top. Like with Kelle, you feel the need to end it quickly. Your left hand holds the boy\u2019s throat, holding his head steady, your right winds up, telegraphed, but your target isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nPain explodes into your knuckles. The boy\u2019s eyes roll back in his head.\n\nYou raise your fist again, meaning to rain down another devastating blow, one to an unconscious opponent. Prinn\u2019s cry draws you from the act. Arm cocked, you turn to find Prinn pinned down, the other goon blasting ape-like fists down both at once. By now Prinn\u2019s glasses are a crumpled mess, twisted, bent, and shattered nearly beyond recognition. A deep sound resonates through your throat, primal, the tone not needing coherent words to infer its meaning.\n\nYou imitate the rush of the three boys, charging head down, arms propelling you to greater impact. Your shoulder drives into the boy\u2019s side, knocking him from Prinn. Your arms reactively reach down as you land, giving yourself two handfuls of dirt and fallen leaves from the forest floor, the leaves dead and scratchy in your open palms, which, naturally, you use to greet the boy\u2019s exposed face. Blinded, coughing, he tries to locate you with his arms. You easily step past them, rising to your feet and sending a foot into his gut. And another. And another. Finally, you finish by kicking more dirt into his face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d you hear Kelle shout. He\u2019s managed to recover from your kick, and stands holding Prinn by the back of his hair. That\u2019s not what catches your eye, however. What does, is a heart-sized stone raised overhead. Over Prinn\u2019s head. \u201cOne more move and I pound the little runt\u2019s face into oblivion. He\u2019s almost as bad at fighting as you are with exams.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut the rock down,\u201d you try to state calmly. You notice a slight tinge to your voice and hope Kelle didn\u2019t catch it.\n\n\u201cFat chance. You\u2019re going to watch.\u201d\n\nTerror seizes your body, overtaking the rage that beset you earlier. \u201cWatch what?\u201d\n\nGrinning, Kelle says, \u201cOn your knees, runt.\u201d Prinn complies with a small amount of help from Kelle. The hand holding Prinn\u2019s hair releases for a moment, but Prinn doesn\u2019t move. The rock still threatens from above. Kelle reaches inside his robe, and although it\u2019s hidden from behind Prinn\u2019s head, you know exactly what he pulled out. Kelle\u2019s grin grows wider as the sound of water dripping fills the sudden silence. Prinn\u2019s face is a combination of disgust and shame; it\u2019s a shade of red deeper than being tongue-twisted speaking to a girl. Kelle intentionally sprays a little to the side of Prinn\u2019s head, making sure to get some on his ears and cheeks. You watch, helpless to help your friend.\n\nKelle ends with a shake. \u201cNext time I\u2019ll save some for you.\u201d The deed done, the fighting over, the victors apparent, the two goons gather themselves and limp to Kelle. They suffered more damage than you or Prinn, but sometimes victory isn\u2019t by raw damage alone. A defeated morale makes for an easy opponent, it\u2019s the wind taken from their sails, the breath from full lungs. You don\u2019t really know what to say. There are no words that are comforting in a situation such as this. All you can do is offer Prinn a hand to his feet.\n\nPrinn meets your eyes, and you see a look you\u2019ve never seen in the boy\u2019s face. It\u2019s the face of an adult that learns he\u2019s unable to provide food for his family, the face of a slave facing the gallows, the face of a boy who just was pissed on in full view of his best friend. The constant jokes, even when inappropriate, are long gone. The book-smart intelligence, top of the class smarts, served him no purpose in a fist fight, the grim reality of that fact settles on Prinn\u2019s face. His name may be at the top of the list, but the boy himself is vulnerable.\n\n\u201cNever again,\u201d he whispers.\n\nThe tunnel opens through a small door, about half the size of a man, hidden by shrubbery at the base of a small creek. Bright green, though slightly dulled by the low light, bursts into your vision. At least there aren\u2019t any ladders. Scoutleader Prinn shuts the door and pulls a padlock from the inside of his cloak. First a key, then a lock--you wonder what else is hidden inside. The creek is almost peaceful. Water runs (the shame on his face) at a comforting level, the kind that soothes a child to sleep. Smooth white stones peek through the top of the water, their size revealing to the water\u2019s depth, grassy moss spreading across the surface of each.\n\n\u201cIs it safe to have such a tunnel lead into the garrison?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cAnd the trespasser would do what? Lock himself in jail?\u201d Prinn answers, the humor from his voice long gone--by many years if you had to guess.\n\n\u201cYeah, forget the obviously unguarded entry into your fort,\u201d you utter to yourself. Both men ignore the comment.\n\nPrinn looks towards the canopy. \u201cWe haven\u2019t much time. I hope you\u2019re ready to put that thing to use.\u201d\n\nRedding flips the dagger in his palm. \u201cMore than.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. This way then.\u201d\n\nYou follow the route that Prinn climbs, stepping on the same stones as you leave the creek behind. In another time, it would be a relaxing place to spend an afternoon, especially with the company of ale and a woman. But now that\u2019s the furthest thing from your mind. Back in the New World wilderness, you find yourself wishing that you weren\u2019t given the crimson tunic of Magda. For one, it sticks out like a soldier in the wrong formation. For two, the long Alteran overcoat is better suited for the elements.\n\nThrough the forest you go, led by the scoutleader. It\u2019s hard not to notice the way he carries himself in the environment opposed to Redding, for example. It\u2019s less of a military march, more of a casual stroll. Part of it could be that there are only three of you, not an entire company of soldiers, but you imagine Prinn would have the same manner whether he were alone or had a thousand men behind him. Comfortability. Ease. Prinn travels as if the forest were his bunkhouse. Being a scout, that\u2019s often the case.\n\nAs you continue, the sounds of battle fade back into existence. They start light, like footsteps off in the distance growing louder with each step forward. \u201cWe\u2019re going to flank an entire war party as three men?\u201d you whisper. Prinn turns, and for the first time since you\u2019ve seen him, he has the semblance of a smile. It\u2019s not quite yet a grin, however. Just the beginning of one. Prinn simply points up towards the canopy above.\n\nYou glance up to find 13, maybe 15 pairs of eyes staring back at you. They\u2019re at least several stories up. Like their scoutleader, the rest of the Magda scouts wear a forest green cloak and carry bows. Unknowing to you, they had been escorting you the entire way, lightly jumping between tree branches. Still, the fact remains.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to flank an entire war party as fifteen men?\u201d you adjust your questioning.\n\n\u201cNot quite. We\u2019re going to shadow them to their camp. We haven\u2019t been able to find where they travel from. I\u2019ve been all over the area, and there\u2019s no sign of their tribes, not to mention an entire war party, stopping anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dagger is bait,\u201d Redding says. \u201cYou knew the Blackbirds would be upset by our...claim of the artifact.\u201d\n\nThe scoutleader nods. \u201cAnd we assumed, right, that they would send numbers to retrieve it. We\u2019ve pulled them out of hiding, and they\u2019ll take us back to their camp. Then they\u2019ll face the full might of Magda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are we here?\u201d you ask. \u201cIf it\u2019s the artifact the Blackbirds want, then it\u2019s out here, exposed, far from the safety of the fort. We aren\u2019t trackers, nor expert woodsmen. It seems risky to include us on a mission you\u2019re more than capable of handling yourselves.\u201d\n\n(Such boldness. Never afraid to speak your mind, are you?)\n\n\u201cCaptain Alexander thought it best,\u201d Prinn says with a sigh. \u201cYou might wear the colors of Magda, but there may still be questionable feelings among the soldiers. I heard about your run-in with the lieutenant, Benjamin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut still,\u201d you answer. \u201cThe dagger is bait. Usually with bait a trap is waiting to be sprung. We\u2019re exposed,\u201d you say for a second time.\n\n\u201cOrders are orders,\u201d Prinn replies. Besides, the war party is currently busy throwing themselves at the garrison. They\u2019ll be too distracted, with their tails tucked between their legs, to be aware of us. Enough talk. We draw close.\u201d\n\nNo more words are shared. The three of you, along with the scouts above, creep forward, taking extra caution now that you\u2019re near to the Blackbird war party. You use the overgrowth to your advantage, never stepping out into the open air. There\u2019s always another area of cover to hide behind, and you allow yourself to bounce between cover to cover. Wind rustles through the trees, the creaking of branches holding against the unseen element, sounding not unlike the way a galleon settles into the water. Now that you're aware of them, you recognize the sound as the scouts, although the tiny sound they make blends in with the environment.\n\nYou can almost make them out through the trees now. Shadowy figures standing taller than any Alteran, their backs turned towards you. Their armor is crude. It\u2019s a kind of leather far thinner than the one you currently wear. You wonder how fearsome a Blackbird would be donned in full plate, swords and arrows useless against the heavy armor. Luckily, their \u201carmor\u201d can barely be classified as such. Tromping through the forest, you understand why, not to mention they probably have no engineers or inventors like a civilized society boasts.\n\nSuddenly, a pair of boots lands between the three of you, a whirl of green follows like a flag raised to the top of a pole. One of Prinn\u2019s scouts.\n\n\u201cSir, the Blackbirds\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Blackbirds what, soldier?\u201d Prinn narrows his eyes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve broken through the main gate.\u201d\n\n(Out of the frying pan, into the war party?)\n\n\u201cGods,\u201d Prinn curses.\n\n\u201cOrders, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sense in learning of their camp\u2019s location if there is no garrison to counter attack. We come to their aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fifteen of us?\u201d you interject.\n\n\u201cSixteen, actually,\u201d Prinn corrects. It doesn\u2019t bring any relief.", "action_results": [{"action": "War!", "result": "They thought they were safe behind their walls. They thought their shiny armor would protect them. Fools. The Raven is above the craftsmanship in which they take pride in. They are godless men, outsiders from across the Great Sea. The Harri\u2019ar treat them as such. When a tiger preys on your livestock, it must be put down. The tiger thinks itself a mighty predator until the very moment of its slaying. When the spear is raised high, only then does it understand. The same goes for the invaders. Trespassers, defiliers.\n\nThe Veil protected the warriors, a gift of magic from the Raven itself. The faith of their people rewarded them. Arrows fall harmlessly to the side, same for javelins. The men at the walls don\u2019t possess any of the black smoke, large cylinders exploding in a burst of fire and smoke, tearing destruction through all in its path. No, these ones only possess simple weapons, and they do not know them like the Harri\u2019ar. A warrior is a warrior despite the weapon in his hand. The outsiders feign as warriors, using black smoke and sharpened steel as their strength. Left without either and they are but jungle vines to be cut from the Harri\u2019ar path.\n\nFire from Father Sun Himself tore through their walls like a rock dropped into a pond, rippling, spreading flaming destruction. Let them hide behind their walls now. Their safety, like their gods, are false. Bodies thrown from the crumbling gate, soldiers frantically trying to douse the flames. The high priests in their--in our--collective faith brought victory. Still, they mustered a defence, small men listening to the shouts of their chieftains. Horns sung in the battlefield, their sound bringing meaning to the invaders.\n\nLet them try. Let them struggle. Let them die.\n\n---\n\nThe Blackbird war party is entirely in the clearing, the area where the Magda garrison cut down the forest to mere stumps. You\u2019re able to creep to the very edge of the treeline without encountering any warriors. They\u2019re all concerned with attacking the keep and have not posted guards at their rear. Bodies clash. The ground is littered with countless bodies already. Like the trees, they\u2019ve been cut down, also becoming stumps in many cases. And the day is still young.\n\nLike the sun high in the sky, a massive hole exists where the gate once did, its edges a reddish orange. The sight of the fiery impact draws you back to the voyage, fire raining down from above, ships sinking down to the ocean floor below. (It\u2019s almost time.) Countless bodies on the ground, countless more still breathing, attacking. Like sand running through an hourglass, the Blackbird warriors pour through the narrow opening of the gate, through the blast, the wind caused by their rush helping keep the flames alive.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most thought-out plan. It\u2019s not by bravery or a sense of heroics. It\u2019s simply all you can do. You charge from the brush, weapon drawn, fifteen other soldiers at your back. Arrows whizz past your head, friendly ones. The scouts fire a volley to guide you towards the enemy. Normally, the thought of arrows shooting this close to you would make you uneasy; however, after experiencing the scouts\u2019 silent way in which they move, the flawless way they blend into the forest itself, you are completely comfortable. Relieved, even.\n\nYour longsword, in both hands, cuts through three Blackbirds before they even notice your presence. Now that they\u2019re aware of the sixteen man flank, you put a bullet in two more, the boom of your flintlock no longer an issue. The Blackbirds are fearsome, standing a full head taller than you. What they aren\u2019t is efficient. Heavy swings, telegraphed swings. They fight with full emotion, as a single warrior in a sea of them.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s the first time fighting with the Magda scouts (although not the first with Prinn), the discipline of a soldier takes over. Redding and you are as unified as they come, and the scouts have the good instinct to supplement your onslaught with arrows, creating a finely sharpened dagger that cuts as finely as an experienced battlefield surgeon. Speaking of dagger\u2026\n\nRedding wields it in his off-hand, letting Blackbird warriors taste the artifact that their ancestors died to protect, bound in un-death to protect, the very thing the war party came to reclaim. As far as \u201cturning the tide,\u201d it doesn\u2019t appear to be anything more than a dagger, albeit one that's quality is beyond all. It\u2019s just a dagger. (We\u2019ll see about that.)\n\nThe Blackbirds that recognize it harbor a frenzy beyond belief. They swarm like bees disturbed in their hive. Suddenly, a sinking feeling starts in your stomach. The plan is going very wrong. The Blackbirds were lured here, yes, although losing the fort wasn\u2019t accounted for, neither was rushing into a Blackbird war party as sixteen men. To make matters worse, the company is still locked in the dungeon, vulnerable to the attacking natives.\n\nYou allow the feeling to fuel your sword arm. The rage rises in your blood. Not here. Not now. Frustration, anger is a source of energy unlike any other. It burns within, focusing the mind. The world around you seems to meld into a single scene; no longer are there Blackbirds, defending soldiers, and fallen bodies. Instead, there\u2019s just you. Your mind becomes only concerned with each swing of your blade, the trigger of your flintlock. All else be damned. The Blackbird warriors that dare challenge you are handled with ease, the flow state allowing you to smoothly tear through their defenses without a second thought--without a first one either. Your body simply reacts to whatever is in front of you, the mind far removed from taking the reins, is but a passenger through the carnage.\n\nYou\u2019re slightly aware of the primal grunts that spill through your lips, a deep throaty sound that accompanies the swing of your sword. Deep in your state, words have no meaning. None could express yourself as clearly as the primal sounds. The guttural tone is communication enough. Tens, perhaps even a hundred, lie dead behind you on your path towards the garrison. More, still, stand in your way. More will die.\n\nA horn sounds in the distance, the same one that rang on your arrival to the garrison. From within the fort\u2019s broken walls, the rallying cry of men shout. Alexander! He is organizing a counter attack. The horn brings you from your flow state. Instantly, thoughts begin to pour back in a great tidal wave. The company, the counter attack, the artifact, Prinn, the scouts, the High King, your standing with Frontrunner\u2019s Camp--you shake your head in an attempt to dam the thoughts.\n\n\u201cKid!\u201d Redding shouts. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cOtherwise we\u2019re directly in their would-be retreat path, I know!\u201d you shout back.", "action_results": [{"action": "Cut your way to Alexander", "result": "With the Magda forces gathering, you\u2019re safer off rejoining with them. The only issue is that it\u2019s through an entire Blackbird war party. You\u2019ve gained no small amount of success, however, and press on. With the scouts behind you firing arrows, you continue the momentum forward, cutting through the forces like a spearpoint finding a gap armor. The Blackbird warriors are great in size, yes. But they lack the precision and efficient movements of an Alteran or Magda soldier.\n\nYou keep cutting onward to the gate, reloading the flintlock between short gaps of opponents. Soon, the time between is growing less and less. You\u2019re barely able to finish one warrior before the next is standing in his place, often more than one. The momentum halts. Instead of driving the spear into the armor gap tearing into flesh, it finds sturdy chainmail underneath.\n\nHeavy swing of axes, stabbing of spears. They rise in frequency to sheer physical impossibility to defend against them all. Not two minutes into attempting to cut your way to the garrison, a spear makes its way past your defenses, and unlike the aforementioned analogy, there is no chainmail underneath. Pain shoots throughout your body, originating from the wound between your chest and shoulder. Instantly, your left arm loses its strength, and you\u2019re forced to wield your longsword with just your right.\n\nFirst things first. You chop down with your longsword, snapping the spear shaft into two pieces, the point side still sticking from your torso. Next, you slice low, running the edge of your blade against the Blackbird\u2019s thigh. As he drops, unable to support his weight, you imitate the maneuver to his throat. He falls. Two more take his place, and they sense blood.\n\nGritting your teeth, more primal sounds humming within, you don\u2019t allow them to attack. Instead, you take it for yourself, charging forward swinging the longsword more frantically than before, urgency screaming in your brain. The spear still sticks from your chest like a small sapling in a clearing. Two warriors stand in your way, one wielding two axes, the other a spear. They hungrily await your attack.", "action_results": [{"action": "Axes", "result": "The one wielding the axes must be taken down first. He possesses the most danger.

One hit from either, and you\u2019d be done, the head creating a deep, lengthy wound, a deadly one at that. But still, you must keep an eye on the spear as well. Can\u2019t be too focused on what\u2019s in front of you, not on a battlefield.\n\nSwinging with one arm, you attempt to use the length of your sword against the axe. Your weapon has more reach. The surface area of its blade is much greater. Without both hands to support the weapon, however, you\u2019re forced to use wide sweeps and swings, creating force with the weapon\u2019s momentum. If the warrior in front of you bore a shield, it\u2019d be for naught. Two axes, not much in terms of defense-ability, the tactic is sound.\n\nPain throbs at your shoulder. Your right arm starts to tire. Still, you attack.\n\nThe Blackbird is able to deflect your assault, sliding back just out of reach from your follow up attack. You swing, he parries and steps back.

You realize what is happening, although you\u2019re also aware what happens if you stop the assault. As long as you continue attacking, your opponent cannot return his own, especially when he does not have time between parries.\n\nThe tactic is sound, save for the other Blackbird warriors. They know your death is near. Deep within your mind, you know it as well, but you aren\u2019t willing to acknowledge the thought. The others allow you to continue the duel with the axe bearer, interested in who will reign victorious. At least most of them are. Movement flashes in the edge of your vision. Instinctively, mid-attack, your left hand reaches for your flintlock. You scream in pain, but still, somehow, manage to draw the weapon and cock back the hammer.\n\nClick. Nothing.\n\nClick. Nothing.\n\nClick, click, click. The flintlock is empty; you weren\u2019t able to reload after the latest firing. The new Blackbird understands this, a smile forming at his lips. He towers above you.

He must be taken down first.\n\nWith one arm you swing forward, taking the offensive while careful not to allow another point to find its way through your defenses. You\u2019re able to keep going for now, but another wound like the one at your shoulder would mean certain death. The spear, sharpened stone to a razor\u2019s edge, deflects your attacks, the shaft itself taking the majority. A few more swings, a few more deflections.\n\nThen, the counter.\n\nA flurry of stabs. You barely have time to register them. Your left arm useless, you\u2019re unable to keep up with just your right, so instead of parrying them all, you give ground.

Mid-parry, a nervous feeling starts in the pit of your stomach, like the sudden news of a family member passing. In a way, it\u2019s the very same: the death, your own.\n\nEach step back, each foot further into the war party, you\u2019re acutely aware of the circumstance. Stand ground, die.

Three spectators fall.\n\nThe act furies the war party. You might have just spat on one of their customs, three warriors finding themselves in the splash zone. Duel be damned.

You\u2019ll not allow emotion or a false sense of honor take you into certain death, which is guaranteed if you attempt to cut your way to Alexander. You\u2019ve amounted no small measure of success with the war party\u2019s back turned towards you; facing them directly, you\u2019re simply sixteen men against hundreds. It\u2019s not pretty, it won\u2019t be written down in warrior tales, but you prefer life to a \u201cglorious\u201d death on the battlefield.\n\nYou turn and run for the treeline. Arrows whizz past your face. Your heart stops for a moment, your mind screams at you to duck, find cover, flatten yourself on the ground, hands in front of head. The scouts, between you and the treeline, have another volley of arrows ready to fire, and you\u2019re running straight towards them. Fourteen bows drawn in your direction, fourteen razor sharp arrowheads pointed at you--it doesn\u2019t settle the mind, to say in the least. Like a hornet flying near, the worst thing you can do is react, swat at it, so you try to force the image from your mind, though it wanders a little, imagining what it\u2019d feel like if one scout misfired.\n\nLike a gentle breeze against your skin, you actually feel one of the arrows fly dangerously close to your face. Still, you keep your sprint towards the trees. The horn rings through the air again, and more soldiers cheer over the sound of battle, a triumphant roar unified as one. Your sword in one hand, the other pumping, propelling your body forward, the sound of your breath a steady cadence in the chaos of war, you enter back into the jungle. The scouts let loose another volley before entering; they take to the trees, including Prinn, leaving Redding and you alone on the ground.\n\nYou take the opportunity to glance back. Through the flaming hole in the gate, the Magda garrison is managing to drive the Blackbirds from within. Instead of the native warriors pouring through, now, crimson-colored, steel breastplate soldiers march forward in tight formation, their shields creating an impenetrable defense, leaving the natives at mercy from the archers firing on the ramparts. Whatever power causes the blast in the fort isn\u2019t using it on the soldiers, who would be at their mercy. The Blackbirds are split. Some continue to attack, throwing themselves recklessly against the well-armed soldiers, some sprint for the treeline, same as you. That\u2019s more than enough motivation for you. You turn back and keep running, following the exact trail Redding sets before you.\n\nThe journey is familiar. Redding seems to be heading in the direction in which you came, to the small creek and tunnel back to the garrison. The rest is a blur of tree trunks, overgrowth, and dirt. Your vision is mostly down to step exactly on Redding\u2019s bootprints. The man keeps a quick pace for someone who is several years your elder. Redding has never been one to solve problems by physical means, but now you\u2019re starting to think he could if he preferred, which is surprising, but not nearly as surprisingly as everything else you\u2019ve found out recently about the man. Your mind briefly wanders from thoughts of Redding to the company. The garrison took significant damage, and you hope that didn\u2019t extend to the dungeon. If you are heading back to the tunnel, perhaps you can check on them.\nA little while later you\u2019re back at the creek. Smooth stones, moss crawling on top, the gentle sound of running water. Peaceful, almost, your bloodstained hands and body disturbing the serenity. Redding\u2019s sitting on a stone, drinking out of his waterskin. You collapse on a stone of your own, but not before splashing a few handfuls of cold water on your face, a refresher as good as any.\n\n\u201cWell, that didn\u2019t go as planned,\u201d you break the silence, dryly. It\u2019s all you can think of saying.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t it?\u201d Redding questions in his usual manner.\n\n\u201cYou know after all we went through to claim that dagger of yours, I thought it\u2019d have more of an impact.\u201d\n\nThe humor leaves Redding\u2019s tone. \u201cMe too, kid. Something\u2019s wrong with it. Its power is dormant. It\u2019s there within. I can feel it. But it didn\u2019t awaken. It should have once tasting blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe me answers,\u201d you say, directly.\n\n\u201cThat I do,\u201d Redding agrees.\n\n\u201cStarting with these,\u201d you gesture at the crimson tunic underneath your leather armor. \u201cTell me why the hell we wear the colors of the High King\u2019s rival.\u201d Your passion, your anger rises. It happens during combat, and it happens in conversation. \u201cTell me why you, we, betrayed the company and they sit locked up, maybe dead after the Blackbird breach. Tell me why the FUCK we are traitors to Alteran and can never go home again, or else the noose will greet us rather than family and friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Redding says. He takes a gulp in preparation. The running water of the creek fills the silence for a moment as if begging you to stop fighting. \u201cThe Old ways are dying. You know that. The ways of the High King and Alteran are quickly becoming obsolete. The days of blindly following the chain of command, government, superiors--whatever--are passing away. Think back to the night before our departure for the New World, to the tavern with billboards covered in Alteran propaganda. Is the New World anything like you were promised?\u201d\n\nHe actually waits for you to shake your head before continuing again.\n\n\u201cThe Old World is built on rules, laws, and regulations. Structure is in place to suppress the free thinking individual. The Alteran citizens are told who to hate, who to love, never allowed to think for themselves. The \u2018rules\u2019 of war are bullshit. It\u2019s a way of keeping conflicts going, while preserving the lives of soldiers so citizens never learn the reality of war. All that is rendered obsolete with the discovery of the New World. This is a place for a man\u2019s life to be his own. There is endless possibility, endless wealth. And what do the High King and Supreme Leader Fargrave, both, want? To apply the rules of the Old to the New. See, they seek to claim the New World as an extension of their own. Their interests are aligned in that regard. When it comes to the New World, they are more ally than enemy.\u201d\n\nYou spit on the ground, a reaction caused by years of conditioning. Comparing the High King to his rival is like someone telling you a pot of boiling water isn\u2019t hot and it\u2019s safe to place a hand inside. \u201cSo then aiding Magda, turning coat, is no different by that logic. If you take issue with serving the High King in the New World, then serving the Supreme Leader is exactly the same. If both their interests are aligned, then either way you\u2019re bringing the Old to the New.\u201d\n\nThe Redding grin creeps slowly to the corner of his lips. \u201cAnd who says I\u2019m serving Fargrave?\u201d\n\nOnce again you motion towards your tunic.\n\n\u201cMeans to an end,\u201d Redding says. \u201cNow I know the location of both Alteran and Magda in the New World, safely uncovered the artifact, discovered a secret entrance into the Magda fort, and once Scoutleader Prinn and his green cloaks return, I\u2019ll know the location of the Blackbird war party\u2019s camp. If there\u2019s one thing you should take from all of this, it\u2019s that my allegiance is to the individual. I sense it\u2019s largely the same for you, despite the High King\u2019s attempt at brainwashing. I\u2019ve seen how you\u2019re different from the others. You know that I\u2019m right. I may be breaking the laws of the two most powerful nations in the world, New or Old, rendering myself an enemy and fugitive of the state, but it\u2019s all for the greater good. Together, we can sever the ties of the Old World and ensure they don\u2019t bind the New World.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s why. Originally you had thought Redding chose you because he knew of your past with Magda, but instead, it\u2019s due to your ability to think for yourself. Since he mentioned it, your mind goes to the tavern, the night before departing for the New World. You were off by yourself questioning the posters encouraging the Alteran citizen to enlist into the military. That, in addition to your aim with a flintlock and strength with the sword, made you a likely candidate to join Redding\u2019s Free Thinking Army. That all makes sense. The artifact, however, is still a question mark.\n\n\u201cThe artifact,\u201d you say. \u201cHow did you learn about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say a certain Alteran messenger \u2018lost\u2019 a very important parchment meant for Captain Briggs, one that told the story of a hidden weapon buried in Blackbird ceremonial crypts or something like that. A mysterious weapon that could turn the tide of the war? Alexander was more than willing to offer his support and aid in the matter. Means to an end. Truthfully, it\u2019s rather disappointing, but at the very least it\u2019ll serve as a symbol between us and the Blackbirds. Until I learn to draw on its power, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour \u2018symbol\u2019 is in the shape of a target on our backs,\u201d you point out. \u201cYou summoned an entire war party by disrupting the burial place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh, that\u2019s not the case for all tribes. Some will join the cause of the wielder. The Old World\u2019s poison is affecting the Blackbirds too. They\u2019ve been united under a single leader. This dagger,\u201d he pulls it from its sheath, \u201cwill separate them from their collective thinking. They believe it is sacred, you see. Above any chieftain or priest.\u201d\n\nYou entertain pointing out that they\u2019d be leaving, \u201cblindly following,\u201d one authority for another. Redding isn\u2019t a leader in that sense. Despite his secrets and ulterior motives, you can\u2019t imagine him wielding the dagger simply to rule the Blackbird tribes. If anything, they are a means to an end in his own words. Before you can speak again, footsteps approach. Prinn and the scouts return.\n\n\u201cBack so soon--\u201d you start, then cut off. Encircling the creek is not Prinn and the green cloaks, but a small band of Blackbird warriors. Their weapons are drawn, crude axes and spears. They stand a full head taller than you, donned in simple leather too thin to be considered armor. Ashen war paint covers their face and bodies, giving them a ghastly appearance; these warriors have accepted death already. They are spirits wandering the forest, causing death in their wake on their way to their eventual end. Their destination is the afterlife, and they mean to take as many along with them.\n\n\u201cFinished asking questions?\u201d Redding says, rising to his feet, sword in hand.\n\n\u201cFor now,\u201d you answer, pulling your longsword from your back, the weight of the blade familiar in your hands. The creek, again, protests in the background.\n\nOne of the Blackbird warriors steps forward. You count eight of them in total, eight warriors who are very much aware of your presence. Mentally you take a note of the creek and stones that would potentially trap or trip you up. Some will also separate their superior number into one, maybe two at a time. \u201cYou disturb what is not yours, tek\u2019usan.\u201d\n\n(No argument here.)\n\nYou\u2019re unfamiliar with the word, but you know an insult when you hear one. They speak common. Strange.\n\n\u201cYou know our language,\u201d you address him.\n\n\u201cYou are not the first to travel across the Great Sea. You will not be the last.\u201d The warrior speaks with a heavy accent. Each word is articulated slowly and deliberately, it\u2019s own, not the smooth cursive speech of an Alteran. The Blackbird woman you encountered alone in the forest days ago didn\u2019t appear to speak common, although perhaps she didn\u2019t want to reveal that she understood your language. The warrior continues. \u201cYou have invaded our land and not come in peace. You will return to your ancestors.\u201d\n\nThat you do understand. There\u2019s no avoiding what comes next. Now is as good a time as any for Redding to discover the power hidden within the dagger. Otherwise he might not get another chance. With a cry, they attack. Their voices are loud, an attempt to posture, intimidate and affect your sword arm. You\u2019re no recruit. The tactic is obvious. Snarling, you meet their attack with your own. You both speak common, and yet the incoherent words of battle are understood far greater than any words you might have shared.\n\nTwo jump down near to your position, their axes at the ready. You feel the weight of your flintlock holstered at your thigh. (Not yet.) Best to save it if you need a quick resolution. For now you\u2019ll test their expertise in melee. You start with a series of slashes, using the length of your longsword to keep them at bay. You\u2019re careful to keep it technical, however. The last thing you need is to get into a strength match with two warriors far larger than you. Taking the offensive, you don\u2019t allow them the opportunity to get in attacks of their own, unless they\u2019re willing to risk a cut sneaking through their attempts to block. Cut left, then right, lunge forward, feint high then cut low. The series taught by a former teacher speaks in your head, simultaneously, while you perform the technique perfectly, which would earn you the approval of your teacher, but in this case you\u2019re content with the felling of two opponents.\n\nTwo down. Six to go. Two engage Redding, leaving four more for you.\n\nThey mean to overwhelm you first, then Redding. Taking you out of the equation means they can focus their attention on the one bearing the dagger, keeping Redding busy in the meantime. You hop between stones. Tiny streaks of water kick up in the air, trailing from your boots, followed by the heavy splashing of the large Blackbirds. They chase, their speed not on equal levels as one warrior reaches you first. You greet him by turning on your heel, thrusting your longsword backward. The point hits the warrior mid swing, his axe raised high overhead. For an instant you make eye contact. You don\u2019t see the savage, uncivilized barbarian that the stories of Alteran tell. Instead, you see a man, the utter realization of reaching the end of his life.\n\nThree more for you.\n\nClick. Before they can reach you with their spears, your flintlock is in your hand, hammer cocked back. Your hand is steady, like that of a surgeon. You stare down the doubled-barrel, lining it up with the quickly approaching warriors. One second you see them, the next black smoke crowds your vision, the smell of gunpowder, the smell of death. Click. Your second shot fires where the second target would be, despite your inability to see. The smoke clears. Two bodies lie facedown in the creek, staining the crystal water with red streaks.\n\nOne.\n\nBehind the native, you can see Redding isn\u2019t as successful. The two warriors engaging him must be a higher caliber than the ones sent your way. Redding swings with far less discipline that you\u2019ve come to expect of the man, untraditional tactics or not. Something\u2019s wrong. With his next maneuver, you see it. A dark pool at his side, underneath his arm. A wound suffered at the gate, hidden by the crimson tunic and a good card player\u2019s face. However, all bets are off. There\u2019s no bluffing the hand dealt, in this case, a compromised sword arm and a short amount of time.\n\nYou barely have enough time to block. The swing of the last native\u2019s axe hits your sword at the last moment. The strength of the blow sends you falling backwards, not having time to set your feet. Your flintlock flies from your hand and bounces off two stones before landing in the water. Luckily, you hold onto your longsword. Water splashes in the air, soaking your boots completely through, the last of your worries. The warrior approaches. Drops of water spill from your hilt as you raise your sword defensively. Steel greets stone, the impact felt through the thin grip you keep at the hilt, echoing throughout the length of your arms.\n\n(It\u2019s time.)\n\nA startled cry erupts from Redding\u2019s mouth in a sound that would normally be humorous. Given the present situation, it\u2019s more along the lines of a dog\u2019s yelp when beaten with a stick. Suddenly, the remaining Blackbird warriors pause as if a frigate pulling up her sails and dropping anchor. The dagger in Redding\u2019s hand glows ravenlight, the same black purple hue from navigating the halls of the dead, followed by a dark fog of black smoke, like small thunderclouds encircling the dagger\u2019s blade.\n\nIt flies from Redding\u2019s hand, pulled by some unseen force and flips several times in the air, blade over hilt, before landing squarely in your open palm, the very hand that dropped the flintlock not seconds before.\n\n(Dormant power, he says. my power has never been more alive.)\nWho--\n(Yes, yes. Who are you? What are you? How did you...? Let\u2019s not waste our time with meaningless questions. I do believe there is someone else that wants your attention, yes?)\n\nThe dagger pulls your arm up, leaving behind a trail of dark smoke, blocking the swing of the Blackbird who has since recovered. Teeth gritted, jaw clenched, he appears to be furied by the dagger\u2019s action, rather than showing reverence towards the \u201csacred\u201d artifact. You wonder if he\u2019d feel the same if he heard the voice it spoke through\u2026\n\n(Ready? I don\u2019t really care either way.)\n\nThe very blade of the artifact grows in length. One moment it\u2019s a dagger, the next it\u2019s the size of a short sword. (That\u2019s better. Like stretching your legs after a long nap.) You wonder how the voice knows what that\u2019s like. A problem for another time. The next motion of the artifact is by your own strength, the sudden growth of metal giving the warrior in front of you pause. The black blade rips through the warrior\u2019s axehead, leather clothes underneath, and stops halfway through his torso, giving him the appearance of a tree suffering wounds from a lumberjack just before toppling over. Not a second later, the warrior does just that.\n\n(You seem hesitant. Let me help ease your mind into things.)\n\nThe dark blade retracts back to dagger size, and keeps compressing. A flash of ravenlight, followed by black smoke. Then, familiarity. In your palm, not lies a short sword or dagger, but the grip of a flintlock. Well, not exactly a flintlock, although the weapon bears the same basic shape. A cylinder chamber rests just above the trigger and the barrel, a single one, is much shorter in length. It displays the same shade of black, and the handle has two carved wings at the tips, just as the dagger did.\n\n(Go on. try me. I know you want to.)\nWell...if you insist.\n\nRedding and his two enemies stand still, transfixed at the weapon changing shape within your very hands, the former corporal with his mouth gaping wide open. Might as well test out the strange gun that the artifact shaped for you. Its weight is light, far beyond that of your flintlock. You raise it to a firing position, surprising yourself with how quickly it draws. In a fraction of the time it takes to aim the flintlock, the artifact fires twice, the second shot coming nearly simultaneously, the effect of slamming your left hand down on the hammer before seeing the result of the first.\n\nRavenblack smoke. Two Blackbirds drop with a thud. The smell of the smoke is nothing like the gunpowder you\u2019re used to. It\u2019s somehow sweet, providing the smallest hints of vanilla and tobacco. Eight bodies stain the once peaceful creek, weapons strewn out, limbs displayed in angles only the dead would keep. For the second time, you grab a few handfuls of water and splash it on your face. Redding needed to learn how to activate the artifact\u2019s power. Well, it\u2019s dormant no longer. As if knowing he crossed your mind, Redding slumps down against a stone, leaning his weight against it to limit his own energy expenditure, even for something as little as holding posture.\n\nVoice?\n(Yes?)\nCare to explain?\n(Haven\u2019t you had enough questions and killing for today?)\nNot nearly enough.\n(Another time.)\n\nYou think the voice--the artifact--sounds playful there.\n\n(I think your friend needs medical attention more than you need answers.)\n\nYou rush to Redding\u2019s side to access the damage. The man is breathing through ragged breath, clutching his torso. Through his cupped hand that covers the wound, you see red starting to pour through. Without speaking, you calmly remove his hand to see. The wound appears to be from a spear, judging by the size and entry point. An axe would have broken a few ribs on impact and left a far greater cut. A miniature waterfall of blood pours out as soon as you check, so you instantly place Redding\u2019s hand back. The artifact, which seems to have sensed your next thought, resumes back to a dagger, one that you use to cut a strip of cloth from Redding\u2019s tunic. You use it as a field tourniquet. It\u2019ll have to do until you return back to the garrison.\n\nThe garrison...is that truly your next destination? It has to be. It\u2019s the closest means to find real medical help. Frontrunner\u2019s Camp is too far away, even if you could convince the Alterans that you were set upon by Blackbirds. The story would hold up long enough for Redding to be treated. POW transfers take some time, after all.\n\nAny way you can shape into something to help treat the man?\n\n(Do I look like a tool used for healing?)\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t working for me,\u201d Redding utters through a cough. He spits on the ground, adding more blood stains to the creek. \u201cKid, you now wield the power to turn the tide.\u201d\n\n(Great. Another mortal to bend me to his will. Heard that story before.)\n\n\u201cDo you know anything about the origin of its power?\u201d you ask. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a...living being inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cHearing voices?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, just one.\u201d\n\nRedding tries to laugh, but all he manages is more blood through a fit of coughing. \u201cDamn it, that\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\nWithout missing a beat, you say, \u201cThen your condition must be far worse than I thought. Come on, I\u2019ll get you to the garrison.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in no position to move. And those green cloaks are out there somewhere. You\u2019re better off going on without me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there could be more Blackbirds wandering around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take cover in the tunnel until you return. I\u2019m going to let you in on a little secret.\u201d You physically move your head closer as if there are listening ears nearby. \u201cThe artifact can change into more than just weapons.\u201d\n\n(The old man\u2019s right, you know.)\nShush.\n\n\u201cI see where this is going,\u201d you comment, stepping towards the hidden door. It\u2019s locked shut with the padlock that Prinn pulled from his cloak earlier. It\u2019s high quality, but like any lock the mechanism inside will give way if you manipulate the tumblers just right, something a skilled thief can do with a set of tools. There\u2019s no need for lockpicks. The solution is clear.\n\nSo, uh, how does this work?\n(Close your eyes and count to three. Dream really, really, really big now.)\n\u2026\n(Alright, fine. And here we go!)\n\nThunderclouds. Smoke. Instead of a dagger in your hand, a black key appears. Sure enough, it fits the padlock perfectly. Neat trick, one that you plan to use in the future. It\u2019s not that you find yourself facing locked doors often, but now that\u2019ll never be the case. You help Redding to his feet and support him with one arm. It\u2019s slow going. Eventually, you leave him just inside the door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in no time,\u201d you say. \u201cHang tight. The surgeons will no doubt have their hands full today.\u201d You flip the key in the air, willing it to change back into a dagger. Mid-flight, the increasingly familiar black smoke appears, and a dagger lands in your palm. \u201cI\u2019m sure this thing will help persuade any uptight field physician.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t return without a jug of ale,\u201d Redding says.\n\n(Don\u2019t even think about it.)\n\nYou\u2019ve used up enough time already. Redding\u2019s card face returns, but the damage has been done. He\u2019s in bad shape, truthfully. You roughly estimate he has a day left without treatment. The hidden door shuts behind you, causing Redding to be exactly that. The signs of your earlier violence greets you upon entering back into the creek. It\u2019s not the first peaceful place to be stained by battle, and it sure as hell won\u2019t be the last. You best get moving.", "action_results": [{"action": "Back to the garrison", "result": "You sprint back towards the garrison quicker than your retreat. The prodding of a war party heading in your direction isn\u2019t as much as your leader, perhaps a friend, bleeding out. Your side aches. Your legs feel as if running on sand. But still, they are small nuisances compared to the feeling Redding has. It\u2019s not a day\u2019s journey by any means. However, you\u2019re acutely aware of possible complications upon arriving back to the garrison. Returning without your scout escorts--possibly labeled a deserter. You wonder if Alexander\u2019s protection will still fall on you without the former corporal. Benjamin, for instance, probably wouldn\u2019t mind another crack at you. First, you\u2019ve got to arrive at the garrison. The complications come second.\n\nHalfway there, you realize that you never re-holstered your flintlock. It\u2019s probably ruined by water damage by now, not that you need it any longer. The artifact seems to fulfill that category, and more. You briefly entertain dumping your longsword as well as it\u2019s unnecessary weight. Surely, the artifact can become one.\n\n(I can.)\nThanks for your input.\n\nThe voice can hear your thoughts somehow. You\u2019re bonded in a manner you can\u2019t explain. Even when it\u2019s silent, you can feel its presence, a low humming of energy ready to be unleashed. After Redding is taken care of, you plan to have a long conversation with the voice inside your head, not a comforting thought in the least. Redding mentioned ale. Yes, you imagine there will be plenty of that when the time comes. You arrive back to the edge of the treeline. The garrison lies ahead. The soldiers that occupy the former battlefield are not of Magda. They are not Blackbirds. They wear long blue overcoats, buttons of gold. Their boots rise nearly up to their knees.\n\nThe Alteran battalion.\n\nA grin comes across your face as you step forward, but then stop. You glance down, taking a double glance at your attire. Sure enough, it\u2019s the one issued by the Magda quartermaster. A thousand soldiers of your allegiance stand in front of you, and yet you cannot draw upon them for help. You wear the colors of the enemy. You\u2019ve hurried here, only taking a fraction of time. Patience will serve you now. There\u2019s no sense in rushing in. Let the scene play out before you, then act accordingly. If only you weren\u2019t wearing red while trying to hide in the forest. Oh well. The battalion stands in formation just outside the gate, which still boasts a sizable hole in the center, although the fire\u2019s long been put out.\n\nWe\u2019ve got some time. Speak.\n(Another mortal who thinks me his pet. Cute.)\nYou possess sentience. Is that of your own doing?\n(How refreshing of a question. I\u2019m used to \u2018can you do this? Can you do that?\u2019 difficult question to answer there.)\nIt\u2019s straightforward enough.\n(You possess sentience. Is it of your own doing?)\n...fair enough. Was there a time that you did not occupy the artifact?\n(That, is a better question. Once upon a time, I had a body of my own.)\nWhat happened?\n(A story for another time. I believe your attention is needed elsewhere.)\n\nCrouched under the cover of trees, you see Alexander emerge from the fort, two soldiers at his side. Surrendering? It\u2019s hard to tell with his back turned towards you, but the commanding officer leading the Alteran battalion appears to be Briggs. Same height. Same build. Strange that the Alterans are content to stand outside of the gate when the Magda garrison is in obvious poor condition. The rules of war don\u2019t state anything against taking advantage of an opponent. In fact, it encourages it as long as they are treated humanely.\n\n\u201cThe two tribes are now one.\u201d\n\nA woman\u2019s voice speaks behind you, heavily accented. As such, each word bears deliberate articulation, similar to the way the Blackbird warrior spoke not hours before. The voice sounds familiar. You turn to find the same Blackbird woman that you encountered days ago. You\u2019re starting to think it may not be a coincidence. She\u2019s dressed in the same tanned leather, feet bare, displaying tattoos around her wrists and ankles. Long black hair flows down her back, a single braid running down the side of her face. Unarmed, just as before.\n\nYou suppress your initial questions for now. \u201cNo. They\u2019re bitter enemies. They\u2019d never join as allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that then?\u201d\n\nGlancing back at the fort, you catch Alexander and Briggs clasping hands. Partnership? No, it still could be conquest. Terms of surrender must have been met, and the two leaders are shaking in agreement, like the way a merchant would to a supplier. \u201cThat could mean many things,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cAxes greet enemy. Words greet friends.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strange take on a well-known saying. In common, save your words for friends, enemies deserve only the sword. The quote is old. If you paid more attention to your studies as a youth you might remember how old or who it\u2019s attributed to, not that it would really make a difference in the present moment.\n\n(She\u2019s a priestess. Devoted to an older sect of the Raven by her markings.)\n\n\u201cAnd which one are you?\u201d you ask.\n\nShe smiles, gesturing with her arms. It\u2019s like the sun peeking through a cloudy day. \u201cDo you see an axe?\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d you answer. \u201cListen, any other time I\u2019d love to sit down and chat. Buy you an ale, maybe. But my...friend is wounded and needs help. I came to find a healer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich tribe?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood question\u2026\u201d you answer trailing off in thought.\n\nShe\u2019s smart, this one. On your first encounter, you wore the long coat of Alteran. This time, however, you\u2019re in Magda crimson. There may be a peace brokered between nations, even if that\u2019s in the form of surrender, but spies, turncoats can still expect no mercy, especially those who traded their coat for the losing color. The Alteran arrival may complicate things more than you first expected. Magda won\u2019t stick their neck out for you. None but perhaps Alexander favors you, and that\u2019s only by association with Redding. Alteran hangs turncoats. Yes, the arrival of the battalion is problematic, indeed.\n\n\u201cI have seen this before,\u201d the woman says. \u201cTribes becoming one with a single enemy in mind. It is happening now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think they\u2019re reuniting against the Blackbirds?\u201d You don\u2019t mean to call her that. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t sound like an insult or slur. It just sort of slipped out.\n\n\u201cWe are the Harri\u2019ar,\u201d she answers sharply, sunshine now hiding behind storm clouds. \u201cMany tribes have been made one under the S\u2019umbra, false priests.\u201d She spits on the ground, similarly to the way an Alteran soldier would after the mentioning of Fargrave, although that habit is likely vanished here.\n\n\u201cAnd you do not agree with the S\u2019umbra?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d The outburst causes you to glance back to the soldiers. None seem to have heard. Mentally you take a note not to bring up the S\u2019umbra again, at least if you can avoid it. She speaks again, more calmly. \u201cThey are poisoning the minds of the chieftains. They have twisted the Raven to their own pursuit.\u201d The woman doesn\u2019t exactly say \u201cthe Raven.\u201d You\u2019re aware the words from her mouth sounded different, yet the artifact somehow translated it in real time.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d you say for a second time. \u201cI really can\u2019t delay any longer. My friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have healers,\u201d the woman states, the rest of her meaning is understood. She awaits your response. Could be easier than convincing two nations that you\u2019re not a turncoat. Could be a trap. Could be both solutions are not ideal. Could be that you need to make a decision, fast. Could be that Redding doesn\u2019t have much time.", "action_results": [{"action": "Blackbird healers", "result": "You know it\u2019s the best choice. It seems like the only option that doesn\u2019t put you immediately in the gallows. There\u2019s a chance it puts you in the Blackbird equivalent--whatever that may be--but that\u2019s all it is, a chance. Approaching the fort is all but guaranteeing your fate, Redding\u2019s along with it. No, you\u2019ll have to trust the Blackbird woman, who appears friendly enough. You silently wonder if her beauty is swaying your decision. It probably is, truthfully. Good-looking people always tend to be more persuasive.\n\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d you say, taking one last glance toward the fort. \u201cI could use the help of your healers. My friend\u2019s nearby. We best hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me the way,\u201d the Blackbird woman answers.\n\n(Surprising that you side with the beautiful priestess.)\nSend your judgement elsewhere, voice.\n(You\u2019re mistaken--I would have done the exact same thing.)\nGlad that I know I have your approval.\n(My approval? No. I just said I would have chosen the same.)\n\nYou notice the woman looking at you expectantly. Two hazel eyes stare intently through a frame of black hair, the eyes themselves shining brightly for the dark shade. If you\u2019re going to have internal conversations in your head, it\u2019d be best not to be more aware of your surroundings, and those that are watching.\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d you say, turning back towards the creek. The Blackbird woman follows.\n\nThe journey is traveled mostly in silence. Your mind is occupied with other things rather than conversation, the top of the list being the sudden Alteran appearance. If there was any hope of returning back to the battalion and explaining the situation, it's gone now. No doubt Captain Briggs will find your former company members locked up in the dungeon who will have a condemning tale towards you and Redding. There\u2019s no returning back to either Old World superpower unless it\u2019s with Redding\u2019s head in one hand and a white flag in the other. You have but a single ally left in both the Old and the New World. Redding. Or do I have two now?\n\nThe woman is happy to remain quiet. If only Alteran women possessed the same quality...the inappropriate joke, both for the situation and content, brings a slight grin to your lips. Somehow things seem funnier when they shouldn\u2019t be, like recalling a punchline at a funeral or getting the giggles during prayer. Jokes aside, you\u2019re grateful to travel in silence. It\u2019s a new (New?) change of pace. In Alteran not speaking with someone in your proximity is considered rude. The Blackbirds don\u2019t appear to be bound by such a rule, speaking only when necessary. Either that or you\u2019ve grossly overestimated the woman\u2019s ability to speak in the common language. Likely not though.\n\nSome time later you arrive back at the creek. The Blackbird woman--perhaps you should ask for her name--eyes the fallen native warriors, but doesn\u2019t address it, seeming to figure out the events that transpired in the once-peaceful clearing. It was a bit of a gamble, bringing her here to Redding. After all, the man is only wounded due to fighting her own people. But you imagine the apparent disagreement, even hatred, towards the S\u2019umbra are far greater. If the fallen warriors were following the false priests, then she\u2019d be more than willing to offer aid.\n\nYou reveal the hidden door, hoping that showing the secret entrance to a native won\u2019t come back to haunt you, and come face-to-face with a sword point. Redding\u2019s. The man behind the sword is in bad shape. Sweat drips down the side of his face, like that of a day laborer during a heat wave. After recognizing you, the sword lowers.\n\n\u201cShoulda said it was you,\u201d Redding manages, his card face increasingly falling. \u201cAnd look, you\u2019ve brought a friend.\u201d\n\nThe Blackbird woman--you should really ask her name--steps past you, gently moving your body out of the way with a guiding hand on your shoulder. She examines Redding for a moment, taking in his condition. She utters incoherent words under her breath, ones that not even the artifact picks up and translates for you. She doesn\u2019t speak to Redding, just waves a hand motioning him to lie down.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re one of those clerics. Got it,\u201d a supine Redding chuckles.\n\n\u201cSilence,\u201d is all the woman says to him. She turns to you next. \u201cBring water. Make sure it is upstream of the\u2026\u201d She says another native word that appears \u201cfallen\u201d in your mind. Even without the artifact\u2019s translation, you\u2019d be able to understand by the context. That and only the village idiot would draw water downstream from bodies currently poisoning the creek. You leave with waterskin in-hand to draw from the creek. Blue light glows softly in the tunnel\u2019s exit as you turn, healing magic emanating from the priestesses\u2019 palms. The tattoos on her wrists and ankles shine the same, the markings on her body being for more than simple looks. The woman\u2019s head raises in concentration, her eyes closed. That\u2019s all you need to see. You rush to fill up the waterskin, stepping to a section of the creek far from the skirmish that took place earlier, perhaps a little too far, but better safe than sorry. It takes less than two minutes before you\u2019re back to the hidden door, waterskin full of fresh creek water.\n\nIt takes less than two minutes for the woman to heal Redding\u2019s wound. As you return, your eyes draw to the wound at Redding\u2019s side. It\u2019s almost completely gone. The place where red ran openly, threatening to burst through your makeshift tourniquet, is a dark crimson, the color of dried blood as the body seeks to naturally close its own wound. With the proper medical attention of an Alteran field surgeon, this sort of recovery would take days, less of course with holy magic, but magic healers are few and far between in Alteran, certainly not taking place in battle for the common soldier. In less than two minutes, the Blackbird woman has Redding almost completely healed, although you imagine there might be a constant ache in his ribs for a few days.\n\n\u201cHere, drink this,\u201d you say, offering the water to Redding. Before he can outstretch his arm, the priestess snatches it from your hand. She takes a swig, and another, and another. As she drinks, you and Redding glance at each other, both giving the eyeball equivalent of a shrug. Soon, the waterskin is empty again, a small dribble of water running down from the woman\u2019s lips. She offers the waterskin back to you, which you take and immediately head back to the creek.\n\nThis time, it takes you two even minutes to return, no longer worried about rushing for Redding\u2019s sake. After looking at the woman, gaining her silent approval, you offer the waterskin to Redding. He reaches out, and before his fingers can touch the waterskin, you pull it back, chugging it in its entirety. It\u2019s not a small pouch by any means, and you have a few-found respect for the Blackbird woman. Luckily, your years of downing much stronger liquid, a skill acquired in the military, serves you well. The startled look on Redding\u2019s face is worth the cause, incoming stomach ache or no.\n\n\u201cYou two are meant for each other,\u201d Redding comments. \u201cNow go on, you can\u2019t expect a wounded man to draw his own water. Bet you didn\u2019t think that far ahead, did ya?\u201d\n\nThe woman simply shrugs. With a sigh, you stand and head to fill the waterskin for the third time. This time, it takes nearly three minutes. You feel a steady onset of a stomach ache approaching, although it may just be in your mind for briefly thinking about it moments earlier, like when a family member becomes sick and suddenly every itch in your throat sets off warning bells. You did it as a joke, but silently you wonder why the woman took the water first. Not to say the native people of the New World are without humor--it\u2019s just not what you expected. But also that\u2019s the best time for humor, in your opinion. What did the bartender say to the horse? Why the long face?\n\nAs you return back, you say to the woman, \u201cSo when you said your tribe has healers, you meant yourself.\u201d\n\nShe gives a warm smile. \u201cSomething like that. The Raven\u2019s wing of protection extends to His devoted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny other secrets I should know about?\u201d\n\nThe smile maintains. \u201cNot at this moment.\u201d\n\nGreat.\n\nYou remember what you should have asked earlier. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy.\u201d When she pronounces it, it sounds like ay-fee.\n\n\u201cPleasure to meet you,\u201d you say, offering out a hand, using your best Alteran manners. She stares at your hand, unsure of what to do with it. Next to you, Redding offers a chuckle, but no helpful input. After looking at your hand a few seconds longer, E\u2019ffy slaps your open palm with hers, which only encourages Redding.\n\n\u201cClose enough,\u201d you utter.\n\n(Typical outsider. Not everyone holds to the same customs, you know.)\nTypical voice. Doesn\u2019t help, but still gives criticism.\n\nSuddenly your mind is rushed with images of a Blackbird greeting. It\u2019s like you\u2019re watching a moving picture of yourself completing the gesture. Two fingers tapped against the throat, followed by outstretching the hand, palm open towards the sky. You attempt to mirror the motion with your physical body. E\u2019ffy\u2019s eyes grow wide, the small moment of surprise before recognition appears. She returns the gesture, running the tips of her fingers across your open palm.\n\n\u201cUnfurl your black wings and wait...\u201d you start\n\n\u201c...Let the wind carry you home,\u201d E\u2019ffy finishes the greeting, a phrase that strikes you as a farewell too, another insight from the voice. \u201cSo it has begun already.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cThe bonding of Amir\u2019sshan. He has chosen an outsider. This has never happened before. He has chosen you as his bondsman.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean the artifact?\u201d you say, drawing the dagger for a closer look.\n\n\u201cI mean the god trapped within a mithril prison,\u201d E\u2019ffy corrects.\n\nIgnoring the god comment, although that\u2019ll quickly be addressed next, you anwer. \u201cThe first bond to an \u2018outsider\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be that hard to believe. We\u2019ve only just discovered this World, after all.\u201d\n\nBoth E\u2019ffy and Redding give you the same look at the statement. \u201cShould I tell him or do you want the honors?\u201d Redding says. E\u2019ffy points towards the former corporal giving him permission.\n\n\u201cKid, the New World may be new for you and I, but it\u2019s not in the grand scheme of things.\u201d E\u2019ffy nods, understanding the position that you\u2019re in.\n\nYou challenge Redding. \u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to believe that you had knowledge of a New World all along, and you didn\u2019t claim discovery or wealth in Alteran? The first explorers came back with trunks and trunks full of gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hoax,\u201d Redding says. \u201cDo you see gold lying around, waiting for you to snatch it up? I wasn\u2019t the only one that learned of the New World's existence. Tell me, kid. You\u2019ve had some level of formal education. Do you remember Jeremiah Reddish, famed explorer of Alteran?\u201d\n\n\u201cVaguely,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cThen allow me to fill the gaps in memory.\u201d\n\nFour years at sea he\u2019s been. Not the entire time was spent on the Frontrunner, Reddish\u2019s schooner and lady of the sea. No, the ship captain loves the boat more than--no, not more than Liza and the kids, although she might argue that\u2019s the case. He loves the ship as well as anyone loves anything, a dog his bone, an artist his painting, a father\u2026.no, best not to go there. Finally, he\u2019s home in Alteran. It wasn\u2019t the welcome he was expecting. The ship captain had ventured where no one dared before. A New World! As dangerous as they come. Yet he survived with most of his crew. Half stayed back to build a new life for themselves. Reddish allowed them to. Rations back to Alteran would have been tight anyway. And he may be captain of a vessel, but he\u2019s not captain of their lives. Each man steers his own life ship. Reddish would not take away from that.\n\nThe Frontrunner pulled into harbor mid-morning. The docks were bustling with cargo ships and many fishermen scrambling to find today\u2019s catch. Reddish guided the schooner into the appointed place and dropped anchor. No fanfare. Not even a second glance besides the bookman, who immediately tracked Reddish down and charged an enormous amount for simple docking. A lot has changed in four years. They\u2019ve forgotten me, Reddish thought to himself, a similar thought that echoed through the minds of his sailors. In their defense, four years is a long time, almost double of the time the expedition was supposed to take. Complications. There are always complications.\n\nMeandering through the streets of the capital city, Reddish took in the sights and smells. It\u2019s dirty. Fucking dirty. The cobbled streets hold traces of horse-drawn carts, tracks left not by wheels. Too many people crowded so closely together, the smell from each spreading to the next. And the beggars. When did so many appear? They line the streets and alleys like birds on a tree branch, squawking for spare coin. After spending four years away from the Old World, suddenly civilization felt...wrong. Too many people packed together like...well, like how the Frontrunner\u2019s cargo bay currently sits, not a sliver of space between goods. An abundance of wealth lies in the New World, not in gold or jewels, at least not in the sense most men seek. In the New World lies a treasure that is nonexistent in the Old World, a treasure that no amount of gold can purchase: a life of freedom. True freedom. That\u2019s why half his crew stayed behind, the other half planning to return with their families, Reddish among them.\n\nThrough the winding streets, Reddish wanders until he\u2019s finally reoriented himself with Alteran. It took a few hours and a few ales, but he\u2019s arrived. He almost headed straight for the King\u2019s castle. If he did, this story would have been cut prematurely, a limb severed from the body of possibility, world events changed forever, both New and Old. But something, perhaps guilt? (longing?) caused Reddish to detour his journey at the final moment. Instead of heading straight to the castle, always his first destination upon return, Reddish cuts down Crow\u2019s Lane to a certain two-story house with a certain family inside. His.\n\nIt boasts a new coat of paint, a stone gray. Martha was always on his ass for a new coat. Seems she finally went through with it on her own. One door. Five windows. Reddish took a deep breath in preparation, still unwashed from his four-year expedition, still exhausted from the journey. But he\u2019s home. Finally. Fucking, home. Reddish took the first step and then stopped. Someone moved inside the house, briefly passing by one of the five windows facing the street, a man, a man who looked perfectly in place in Reddish\u2019s home. Did Martha move without telling me? The explorer wondered. And how would she tell him? He\u2019d been unreachable by letter or pigeon. Then, a second movement. One that stopped Reddish\u2019s heart within his chest. Martha.\n\nShe\u2019s laughing. She\u2019s dolled up nice. Are they going out? Her chestnut hair is curled, reaching just past her shoulder blades, covering the space of bare skin that her little black dress exposed. A flash of light drew Reddish\u2019s eyes towards her hands and the rings that seemed to cover each one, all falling short of size and glimmer of the diamond around her purity finger, in the place where Redding\u2019s own, smaller, diamond once rested. Replaced, both with the ring on her finger and in his very own home. Four years exploring the New World, finding all sorts of weird creatures and wildlife, fearing for his life during encounters with the natives, Blackbirds, journeying across the sea, unsure if food and water rations would see him to Alteran alive. Four years, and he never expected this.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how long he stood there, outside, watching his (ex) wife rush back and forth getting ready. It must have been awhile--Reddish remembered how long Martha usually took to get ready. Felt like (four years) hours. But when the distinct sound of the doorknob clicked, HIS doorknob, Reddish, moved by instinct alone, quickly side-stepped behind a nearby lamppost. It\u2019s unlit now. Cold. At dusk it would be lit by torch. The two of them, arm in arm, travel down the stone steps to their home and take off down the street in the other direction.\n\n\u201cMr. Reddish, sir?\u201d a childlike voice, unsure of itself, rings softly behind the man hiding.\n\nReddish turned to find Gabriel, the neighbor boy who often played with his own son. That was years ago. Gabriel appears to be 11 or 12, the age his son would be by now.\n\n\u201cGabriel, you recognized me after all this time?\u201d Reddish can hardly get the words out. Rather than met by his family, he\u2019s met with the boy who played tag with his son, the boy who would discover mischief along with his own heir.\n\n\u201cYou are wearing the same coat, Mr. Reddish,\u201d was the reply.\n\nThe mention caused Reddish to glance down. Sure as hell Gabriel\u2019s right. It\u2019s tattered. Frayed at the edges, and like his home was, the color was faded. He could afford a new one. Now that he\u2019s returned with news of the New World, Reddish could afford 50 new coats if he wanted. But he doesn\u2019t want to. He liked the one he wore. Money will never be an issue again in his life, he\u2019s sure of that fact. But he\u2019s on the outside, a man thought dead and cut from the lifeline of his family. He wouldn\u2019t put them through his return. They seem at ease. Happy. Martha got her new coat of paint. All he would bring is pain to their lives. In four years Reddish became a man who gained the world, a New one at that, and somehow lost everything in the process.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Jack doing, Gabriel? How\u2019s my boy doin\u2019?\u201d Reddish uttered, managing to hold back emotion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d Gabriel answered, a typical response for someone of that age speaking to an adult. \u201cI\u2019m going there now. Want to come?\u201d\n\nWant to come? See his son after four years. The answer is a whole-hearted yes, yes-fucking-please, yessir, lead the way! But that\u2019s not what Reddish said. He couldn\u2019t do that to Jack, who had a new father now, a new life. A boy needs a stable home. Reddish would only cause chaos, disruption to a life that boasts a sturdy foundation. Martha got her new coat of paint. Reddish had no doubt she got a lot more than that.\n\nI...can\u2019t, Gabe,\u201d Reddish whispered. \u201cI have something for Jack, though. Would you give it to him?\u201d\n\nGabriel nods.\n\n\u201cGood. Come with me. We\u2019ll be short, I promise.\u201d\n\nGabriel nods again. Just around the corner. Yes! It\u2019s still there. Macagans. The old tavern was a favorite of Reddish\u2019s, unless Cliff changed the menu drastically. Knowing the old barkeep and owner, Reddish doubted it. As a regular, he couldn\u2019t even persuade the man to serve water for free. Reddish told him it would keep patrons there longer to purchase other food and drink. The barkeep simply said, \u201cIf I pay for it, they pay for it.\u201d Can\u2019t argue with stubborn.\n\nIt\u2019s not late enough for the usual night scene to arrive yet, which was fine with Reddish. Macagans was built from an old docking bay and warehouse. Two giant barn doors serve as the entrance, the inside large, open, and full of fresh air, something that a seasoned tavern patron can appreciate. Often establishments are too tight. High risk of bumping into another and spilling a drink. Like the New World he just arrived from, Macagans gives the freedom to move and sit where he pleased. In the reorienting process, Reddish was grateful for the former warehouse.\n\n\u201cIs that Reddish or do my eyes deceive me? Damn those restless orbs if they do.\u201d Cliff spotted him almost immediately, coming from behind the bar, same apron and by all appearances, the same tunic as he wore four years ago. Besides a little more around the gut, the barkeep looks largely (ha) the same, long sideburns, hairy forearms. \u201cAnd is this your kid. Oh\u2026\u201d\n\nRealization seemed to fall upon Cliff. It\u2019s as if he spilled a secret he wasn\u2019t supposed to say. His face becomes like the explorer\u2019s, reddish. \u201cYou know then,\u201d Cliff spoke again.\n\nReddish ignored the statement. He didn\u2019t want to think about that now, definitely did not want to talk about it either. The letter will be difficult enough to complete. \u201cYou still carry that dark ale, Cliff? The one with the frothy top?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d Cliff answered.\n\n\u201cKeep \u2018em coming. Anytime you see my cup empty, replace it with another.\u201d Glancing down at quiet Gabriel, Reddish added on. \u201cAnd a candied apple for Gabe here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye. Sit anywhere you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll get the first round.\u201d\n\nReddish picked a spot in the corner. Facing the bar, it presented an entire view of the tavern, back to the wall. Exactly how the man himself felt. A single table, two chairs. Reddish took one. Gabe the other. From within his coat (she got her fresh coat), Reddish pulled a parchment and quill. He might not be able to be in Jack\u2019s life, but damn if he wasn\u2019t going to leave him with something to remember his father by. His real father. Where to begin? How can a father pack all that needs to be said in a single letter? A tankard is placed on the table. That\u2019ll help. That\u2019s for damn sure. Reddish starts by getting the hardest part out of the way. Often the most difficult step is the first one. Then momentum builds, carrying. This was the path he\u2019s been forced on. Like in the New World, Reddish sees fit to explore it.\n\n\u201cReddish...Redding, what\u2019s the relation?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather,\u201d Redding answers. \u201cMy father, Jack Reddish--Redding changed it in early adolescence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d you start to ask, but then lessons from your history book creep in. If you remember correctly, the explorer was executed for crimes against the king. Treason. \u201cWere the charges justified?\u201d Strange thing to ask, but it already left your lips. It\u2019s like a friend disclosing an argument they had with a stranger and taking the stranger\u2019s side. Luckily, your strange question is directed towards a strange man.\n\n\u201cSome. Although there was some embellishment of course, as there are with any trial. Treason aside, my grandfather was silenced. He spoke the truth about this place.\u201d Redding kicks the dirt beneath his boots for emphasis. \u201cThere were those from his crew that stayed behind. It\u2019s a hard life, but a free one. Damn if those under the shackles of civilization don\u2019t deserve the chance to break free.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first outsiders,\u201d E\u2019ffy comments. \u201cThey moved west. The tribes drove them from the coast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was wondering about that,\u201d Redding says. \u201cNo doubt the High King would have put them down if they stayed. By the time the military organized and settled here, it left too much time in thought for the crew. Too much freethinking time. The Old ways only work when each link in the chain is content to do their job without questions. Once they start asking them, however...then it threatens the entire structure of civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet they named Frontrunner\u2019s Camp after Reddish\u2019s vessel?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cAnd yet they did,\u201d Redding utters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so hell-bent on changing the New World,\u201d you add on. \u201cThe High King\u2019s father wronged your family. It\u2019s been revenge, slowly building until the opportune moment. Your father, Jack, could not accomplish it in his lifetime. Now the burden rests on your shoulders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so hell-bent on changing the New World because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Redding retorts. \u201cOr did you already forget the way Alteran citizens are treated. Links in the chain. Spokes in the wheel. Cattle under yoke.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re tired of arguing with the man. It never accomplishes anything, and you\u2019re certainly not going to get anywhere debating the task that was passed down from his father\u2019s father, not that you\u2019re against it anyway. Secrets. There seem to be too many, even withheld from your closest allies, which in this case is a single man, perhaps a Blackbird priestess in addition. I\u2019m talking about the god trapped within a mithril prison. Secrets. Too many of them. One problem at a time.\n\n\u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201d you wonder aloud.\n\n\u201cI need your help,\u201d E\u2019ffy answers without a second thought.\n\nYou glance at Redding. He offers a shrug. \u201cHow can we help?\u201d you ask.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "\u201cThe S\u2019umbra have taken over. They have poisoned the mind of the chieftains. The tribes are united, yes. But they are bound under the false priests\u2019 rule.\u201d\n\nThe similarity is not lost on you and Redding. The ways of the Old might not be limited solely to the world itself. It seeps in, the corruption of leadership, a steady deluding until the creek is pure no more. You need only to look around you to be reminded of that fact. A place once peaceful, unstained with blood is littered with the fallen. Perhaps that\u2019s the byproduct of civilization. No, there\u2019s more to it than that. Evil men taking power, allowed to. Without common men standing up, they\u2019re allowed to flourish in their closed-fist approach. Reddish\u2019s, Redding\u2019s, your mission can first be accomplished with the natives on the land. The New World in its rampant overgrowth seems to have a few thorns, a thicket choking the lifeblood of the Blackbirds. The Blackbird priests, the false ones, need to be pruned, cut away from their constricting path. First with the Blackbirds, then, perhaps with native allies at your back, you can turn your attention to the soldiers from the Old World.\n\nReceiving Redding\u2019s approval, you answer E\u2019ffy. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what we can.\u201d\n\n(Ever the hero. I once was like that. We have a lot in common, you and I.)\nExcept I\u2019m not considered a god.\n(Just a title. Nothing more, nothing less. I sense the Harri\u2019ar will not approve of my bonding.)\nI have a feeling they won\u2019t approve of anything when it comes to me.\n(You and the girl, you mean?)\nDid I say me and the girl?\n(It was implied.)\nYou\u2019re reading into things.\n(Eyes on the prize, hero. There\u2019ll always be another set of tits. Trust me.)\n\nE\u2019ffy waits for you to continue. If she has knowledge of the artifact and its power, then she shouldn\u2019t be surprised by instances where you apparently space out...you might need to check your surroundings more when the voice speaks. No, not the voice; the god trapped in a cage, one that has bonded with you for some reason. Amir\u2019sshan, E\u2019ffy called him. Hey, having the six-shooter isn\u2019t a bad deal, especially when compared to the standard issued Alteran flintlock. The voice is simply an annoying side-effect. Nothing more, nothing less, as it would say.\n\n\u201cThe war party hunts the artifact?\u201d You phrase your statement as more of a question.\n\nE\u2019ffy answers, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t returning back with you be heading straight for our deaths?\u201d\n\nShe smiles. \u201cUnder my protection you will be safe. The Raven extends a protective wing over those who do its work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not so sure the others will see it that way. They are \u2018false priests\u2019 after all. Who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t bend the law to\u2026\u201d You make a motion with your finger across your throat.\n\nThe motion causes E\u2019ffy to laugh. It\u2019s a pleasant sound, a clearing in the forest, an oasis in the desert. \u201cThen they would have to\u2026\u201d She runs her finger across her own throat. \u201c...me as well.\u201d\n\nA reassuring statement if you ever heard one. \u201cAlright then. That settles that,\u201d you say, a meaningless comment in its own right. \u201cLadies first.\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy eyes you puzzlingly, likely not hearing the phrase uttered before. Once it registers, she takes off from the creek. Ignoring the fallen Blackbird warriors that you slayed. It\u2019s a nice place, not the first, and it sure as hell won\u2019t be the last to be ruined by mankind. You make it a point to discover a similar place...and leave it pristine. Beautiful. There\u2019s bound to be many such areas in the New World, yet untouched by civilization. The creek softly sings its farewell as you take off after E\u2019ffy, a sad song of melancholy and loss, the cries of an innocent victim.\n\nE\u2019ffy leads you through the forest. You and Redding follow behind, single file. She takes you straight into the heart, journeying farther away from Frontrunner\u2019s and the garrison. If you could see through the canopy, you\u2019d see that you\u2019re heading uphill. The overgrowth masks the climb some; you\u2019re already needing to step over fallen trees and wayward roots, the forest floor on the other side being at a slightly higher level than where you came. Part of you wonders if you\u2019re walking towards your execution. E\u2019ffy seems to know what she\u2019s doing, however. After all, she healed Redding\u2019s fatal wound in mere seconds. The woman could have more surprises; women often do. And there\u2019s still the matter of the god trapped in your dagger\u2026one with a, let\u2019s say, unconventional demeanor.\n\nShe leads you to a cave overlooking the sea. From the elevation, you\u2019re afforded vision over the trees from which you just traveled. They look as if blades of grass, unlike their towering trunks when standing next to them. Here, though, here they are small specks in your vision, nothing but pine needles, small green-tipped matches. Leaving the forest canopy, you\u2019re left in the same darkness. This one is a true dusk, not the false dusklight of the thick leaves. Two great rocks rest on either side of the cave\u2019s opening, like soldiers standing guard for their king. Starlight starts its first shimmer, the way a small diamond would sparkle turning it over from different angles. Soon the sky would be full.\n\nE\u2019ffy does not travel with any equipment. All you and Redding have are your weapons, waterskin, and a few odds and ends that fit in your belt pouch. More odds than ends, matches included. After receiving approval from E\u2019ffy--campfires draw attention, unwanted or no--you flick one and light a small flame just outside the cave\u2019s mouth. Orange glow meets dusklight. Warmth fights the creeping coldness of night. E\u2019ffy didn\u2019t disclose if you\u2019re close to the Blackbird tribe or not. You\u2019re assuming not if you\u2019re stopping here for the night, although arriving in the middle of the night with two Old World soldiers probably wouldn\u2019t sit well with the Blackbird warriors. Likely you\u2019d be greeted with an axe. Or hundreds.\n\nYou settle down next to the flame. No bedroll or pillow for your head, so instead, you use one of the great rocks to lean against. E\u2019ffy takes a place next to you. Redding, unsurprisingly, takes the other rock for himself uttering something about a boat only having two oars.\n\n\u201cIf your tribesmen haven\u2019t spotted us before, they surely have now,\u201d you comment, eyes glued on the flame. A piece of wood cracks in the fire as you finish your last word.\n\n\u201cThey have spotted us hours ago,\u201d E\u2019ffy says. \u201cI told you, the Raven--\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, takes those under his wings of protection,\u201d you cut her off. E\u2019ffy glares at you in response. Framed within the part of her black hair are two smoldering orbs, pupils as dark as the artifact you carry.\n\n\u201cYou would do well not to mock the Raven.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho says anything about mocking? You\u2019ve lectured me on your doctrine before.\u201d\n\n(Yeah! You tell her!)\n\nE\u2019ffy continues her glare, gauging your intentions. From what you can tell, she settles on mistrustful forgiveness. Or something like that. Something about her look says, I\u2019ll let this one slide. Next time, however\u2026\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you two kids get some sleep,\u201d Redding says from across the cave\u2019s opening. Speaking of the cave, no one in your little trio went to explore it. There could be wild animals inside. Or worse, angry Blackbirds. In either case, the artifact would appear in your palm, a small thundercloud along with it, and death would rain from the six-shooter\u2019s chamber. Your other companion flashes you a look much different from E\u2019ffy\u2019s. Two hour shifts. You take first. It\u2019s a traditional sleep watch schedule. Makes for a low energy day the next, but better to have low energy than no energy, life (and energy) taken away in the unsuspecting night by blade.", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk with E'ffy", "result": "\u201cHey,\u201d you whisper.

Unfortunately, it hasn\u2019t made its way to the New World quite yet. Give it a few decades, and you\u2019re sure more than one heroic adventure will involve it. In this case, you\u2019re stuck with solely a beautiful native princess, probably a virgin, too, if you had to guess.

Turning more serious, you add, \u201cYou know, this is probably the place--or at least a hill nearby--where the Blackbirds fired upon our ships. There's a perfect view of the water from here. If it were light, that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you call us that?\u201d E\u2019ffy asks, sounding truly interested. Her eyes, losing the previous glare, look at you the way a child listens to their father telling a bedtime story.\n\n\u201cBlackbirds? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s what everyone calls you back home. Has something to do with your religion. The Raven, I mean. As far as I know, there hasn\u2019t been any friendly contact between our people. So someone along the way called the people here, your people, \u2018Blackbirds,\u2019 and that\u2019s what we know you by. I\u2019m sure you have a name for us outsiders.\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy smiles. Her teeth shine more brilliant than any full moon you\u2019ve witnessed. \u201cTo be polite we call you outsiders to your face...between the Harri\u2019ar you are the tek\u2019usans, \u2018stunted pale skins.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same word the Blackbird warrior called you at the clearing. Your face grows long. \u201cYou\u2019re not taller than me. Maybe just an inch or so.\u201d\n\nShe points towards your boots. \u201cTake those off and it is more.\u201d\n\nRight. E\u2019ffy walks around barefoot. The bottoms of her feet must be conditioned beyond belief, for the forest floor of the New World isn\u2019t soft by any means. True, it\u2019s mostly dirt. But still, rocks, roots, and thorns aren\u2019t a rarity. You imagine it\u2019s a little like walking barefoot in the backyard of your home, having a familiarity with the environment to the point where protection isn\u2019t necessary. Not all backyards have poisonous plants and wild animals though. E\u2019ffy\u2019s might, but yours sure as hell doesn\u2019t--didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d you answer. \u201cTell me something as our lives are in your hands\u2026 Are you in good standing with the tribe? If we are going to help you take the false priests out of the picture, will there be support from any others?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm,\u201d E\u2019ffy ponders, fingers grasping at the single braid down the side of her face in thought. \u201cVery few. My beliefs are...traditional. They hold true to the sect of the Raven that has brought us flourishment. The S\u2019umbra are different. They bind the chieftains together like a crude water raft, riding safely atop while our people take the brunt of the waves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are a priestess, then you must have a temple. Is it large? Do many (Blackbirds) visit?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is sizable, yes,\u201d E\u2019ffy says. \u201cI believe I already answered that question.\u201d\n\nVery few. Great. So you\u2019re about to bring religious revolution to a native people that have currently assembled all their tribes together to hunt the very thing that rests on your hip, the artifact. Amir\u2019sshan. The fucking whipped cream on top of the pie is that the people, the natives themselves, aren\u2019t in support of the revolution. If anything, you\u2019re attempting a tyrannous overthrow, backed with six shots in the chamber and a ravenblack blade. Though to be fair, that\u2019s probably how the S\u2019umbra came into power in the first place. Power begets power. Once you gain momentum, perhaps the tribesmen will turn towards the cause. The cause...what exactly in the fuck is the cause? The individual. Collective thinking, a poison upon both the New and Old World.\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy, I have so many more questions for you,\u201d you say, exhaustion settling in.\n\n\u201cSave them for tomorrow.

It\u2019s as if you\u2019re closer, brought together by the nature of the New World.

But still, like the two-day old ale, it\u2019ll do the trick in a pinch. And you\u2019re in a goddamn pinch, to say the least.\n\nYou rise from your seat. After leaning against a rock for what, two-three hours, there\u2019s a stiffness in your lower back. Let that be tomorrow\u2019s issue. Tonight has plenty of its own. The moonlight affords you vision of your little camp. The fire\u2019s long burned out, black embers and ash lie in the place where flame once danced. Prints on the ground reveal your presence. You never tried to mask them anyway. Off in the distance, the sea, the Great Sea as the Blackbirds would call it, crashes against the shore. The sound doesn\u2019t reach you in your elevation, although your mind fills in the gap, imagining the sound each time a cloudy white line of foam touches the New World beach, the place that almost killed you with a little help from the Blackbirds.\n\nThe footsteps. They lead into the cave. Sword drawn, senses high, you follow.\n\nNot four steps in, the moon, shining brighter than it\u2019s ever before, abandons you to darkness. You\u2019ve stepped from its watchful gaze, from a place of light where misdeeds and lawlessness can be witnessed into a place where the shadows thrive, a place with no accountability for one\u2019s actions. The floor is dirt. You feel its soft impact on your feet, almost sand-like, it\u2019s so loose. You pause a moment to allow your eyes to adjust. They don\u2019t, at least not entirely. What was dark and formless is now dark and slightly-less formless. You can\u2019t see any hard edges, the specific shape of those sharing the cave with you, but you receive a rough outline, spots in your vision that are a shade lighter than the constant darkness. It\u2019ll have to do.\n\nThe cave, with its serpent-like entrance, winds around a few twists and bends. Large stones line the interior, similar to the two standing guard just outside. At least that\u2019s what you silently think they\u2019re for; instead of royal guards, standing post outside their king\u2019s throne room, they could be something else entirely. Jailors, for example, making sure no one escapes the cave. After a few more turns, no branching tunnels or other paths, luckily, the cave opens into a wide cavern.\n\nIt must be deep as you can\u2019t even see the ceiling. It\u2019s dark, and like dropping a pebble into a body of water, once it goes beyond your depth of vision, it might as well be infinite. There\u2019s a small torch lit, however, a tiny flame standing alone against the impending darkness of the cave. It\u2019s not a normal torch though, but it\u2019s one that you\u2019re well familiar with. Ravenlight. It highlights the other figures in the cavern, shadows brought to life, one free, one bound. Their backs are towards you. Even then, it\u2019s easy to tell who they are. Who else? Redding and E\u2019ffy.\n\nRedding is tied to a pillar. HIs arms and legs are spread like the four corners of a compass, bound at the ankles and wrists. Ravenlight dances. The sudden shift in light reveals that Redding has been stripped of all clothes, exposed to the world. More importantly, exposed to E\u2019ffy. She remains in her tanned leather dress, standing completely still in front of Redding. Something in her hand flashes in the ravenlight. The artifact. It\u2019s a dagger in her palm, the wing-tipped handle poking out just outside of her hand. Not that you\u2019ve felt particularly bonded to the artifact, even if that\u2019s the term used for unlocking its power, seeing someone else, E\u2019ffy, holding the artifact (IT\u2019S MINE) feels wrong. It feels very damn wrong. She speaks without turning around, perhaps sensing your presence, perhaps not caring if you watch what\u2019s unfolding. E\u2019ffy carries the artifact, after all. How could you dare stand up to such a power?\n\n(Worthy is the one who sacrifices himself for the Raven. Under the protective wing, the Raven covers those who follow its will. There is no greater glory than the surrendering of one\u2019s life for the greater good.)\n\nHer voice stops you in your tracks. It\u2019s a mixture of the woman herself and the voice you hear in your head. \u201cE\u2019ffy\u2026\u201d is all you can utter, the rest of the words lost to you.\n\n(The second coming is near. All that stands in the way of the Raven will be smote. Let the thunder ring. Let the clouds pour black rain. Its return is here.)\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy,\u201d you say a second time, finding the strength of your lungs. You grip the longsword tightly through both hands, raising it defensively. Nerves run through your body. It\u2019s the feeling before an unavoidable argument, the feeling standing in formation waiting for the battlefield commander to wave you to march upon the enemy. The eventual battle is coming.\n\nShe finally turns around. You wish she didn\u2019t. You wish to every god that was or has existed that she didn\u2019t turn around, that she kept looking forward, fixed on Redding\u2019s bound body. But she does. She turns to look at you, the one with your weapon drawn, knuckles tightly wound against the handle, the blade itself growing increasingly heavier by the second. She turns to face you, and that\u2019s when you see her in all her passion, a religious devotion to bring the Raven\u2019s will about by any means necessary, a hurricane of a woman destroying all in her path to do the Raven\u2019s work.\n\nHer eyes are solid black, pupils hiding in the shadows. No. Ravenblack. E\u2019ffy\u2019s braid, once perfectly weaved together, is completely loosened at the end, strands of hair escaping in single-piece runaways, like the way a sister\u2019s hair looks after a brother ruffles it for fun. A thin line sits where her mouth once did, both lips pressed together tighter than a workman\u2019s vice. Her chest breathes heavily, bouncing up and down, something that would perhaps send your mind into a man\u2019s imagination under normal circumstances, but this is anything but. A dark pool of sweat accompanies her dress, wet blotches near the underneath of her arms and stomach, matching the glistening drips at the base of her neck.\n\n(Would you join me in bringing about the Raven\u2019s will?)\n\nShe--they--don\u2019t wait for your response.\n\n(The end of the drought is here. Those who have taken up in my Father\u2019s house will be driven from it. Wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing. Predators in the night. They now face one far greater than their own. The Raven returns.)\n\nE\u2019ffy\u2019s face seems to melt, features rolling down her head like a mudslide, twisting and mixing with one another. Her skin drips from her face like melted wax from a candle that\u2019s long been forgotten. Ravenblack feathers appear, the woman herself becoming the exact creature that she worships. Sharp talons pour from her fingers, blending in with the artifact; wings sprout at her back. The transformation is almost complete. Her eyes, no longer E\u2019ffy\u2019s, land on you. They're shifty, the way a bird stares, then cocks their head a few seconds at a time, far quicker than a human eye can follow. With a cry, E\u2019ffy, the bird-like creature bears down on you. Your longsword is useless.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wake up", "result": "A hand on your shoulder, a head resting on the other. You awake face-to-face with Redding, squatting to eye level. He holds up two fingers. Time\u2019s up, sleepyhead. You nod and turn to the head resting on your shoulder. When you see her, it takes every instinct in your body not to startle, jump, run. E\u2019ffy\u2019s sound asleep, shifting in the night to use your shoulder as a makeshift pillow, body leaning on one hip the way a woman sits on a picnic blanket in order to save those downwind from an unsavory flash. You suppose it\u2019s a natural position to sit, considering her traveling companions are two men.\n\nThen, Redding and you have the same thought. It\u2019s the instinct that animals seem to have when an earthquake is near, the bones of an old grandmother alerting her to rain clouds on the horizon. Your vision collectively draws to the subtle place E\u2019ffy\u2019s hand has wandered. Whether by accident or not, it rests on the handle of the artifact. Worrisome, to say the least. Your bet is that it\u2019s accidental, unintentional, whatever. After all, she didn\u2019t--or at least it appears she didn\u2019t--try to draw the weapon itself, the artifact currently asleep in its dagger (talons) form. Redding gives you a shrug, one that\u2019s becoming just as patented as his constant smirk, as you gently slide from underneath the woman, lightly placing her hand from the artifact.\n\n(Concerned I\u2019m cheating on you, hero?)\n\nIgnoring the jest, you think back, Do I need to keep an eye on this woman?\n(Have you ever not had eyes on her?)\nYou\u2019re useless. I\u2019m in no mood.\n(Well you certainly seem like you\u2019re in some sort of mood.)\n\nThe voice\u2019s demeanor reminds you of an older sibling being difficult on purpose. It seems to sense the thought...or hear it.\n\n(I would not concern yourself with the priestess. She\u2019s but a wolf pup seeking to take on the pack.)\nThat\u2019s exactly what her allies want to hear after throwing in their lot.\n\nRedding interrupts the dialogue, whispering, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have conversations in your head, do it while I sleep. I can only assume that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing since your mouth is moving in small patterns, but no words are coming out.\u201d\n\nRight. It\u2019s your shift. You decide to take Redding\u2019s position on the other rock. Perhaps some separation between you and E\u2019ffy will help your thoughts flow freely, even if they are altered by the voice. Taking a seat, you glance at the night sky. A cloud layer hangs over you, a steady, well, cloud of dark gray, glowing in the section nearest to the moon, who\u2019s seemed to take a backstage position tonight. The voice, helpful as always, quiets down, allowing you to focus on your watch. Small animals cry out in the night, their howls, chirps, and oddly enough, clicks, unfamiliar to your ears. The night passes without any further interruption, at least not any that don\u2019t occur every two hours on the dot.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning you awake famished. The events of the previous day took precedence over hunger. It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t have any travel rations, not even a small amount of dried meat for a quick fix. You voice it to the others as they awaken. E\u2019ffy takes the chance to volunteer to teach you which plants are safe and which are fine to eat from. WIthout equipment to pack up, there\u2019s nothing else to do than follow her.\n\nSurprisingly, last night was warm. Warm enough to rest comfortably without blankets or a sleeping roll. The morning is a bit brisk, however, making you think exhaustion won the warm/cold battle the previous night. You doubt you\u2019ll return back to the campsite, if you could call it that, and take one last look at the two giant stones guarding the cave\u2019s entrance; the mouth of the cave itself sits dark and void. Will you join me in bringing about the Raven\u2019s will?\n\nE\u2019ffy leads you cheerfully down the path; there\u2019s almost a skip in her step. You\u2019d consider yourself a morning person. Being in the military forces you to be one, although you\u2019ve never felt energy like E\u2019ffy in the morning. You think you catch Redding rolling his eyes a few times, and confirm he\u2019s never felt the same either. It\u2019s the endless energy of a young child, yet unaffected by the weight of life and the tendency to lean on the bottle. E\u2019ffy stops and plucks a few bright berries from a nearby bush.\n\n\u201cDark red is good. Bright red is bad,\u201d she says, handing the berries out. You look down in your palm. The fruit she placed in your hand are red, yes, but different shades of which one could consider both dark and bright.\n\n\u201cThese ones are...ok?\u201d you ask. Next to you, Redding pops the entire handful into his mouth, the way one would toss back a shot of vodka.\n\n\u201cDark is good. Bright is bad,\u201d she repeats again.\n\nYou slowly raise your hand to your lips. E\u2019ffy watches intently. At the last moment, she nods her approval, upon which you toss back your handful as well. Flavor bursts into your mouth. Juice squirts out from the berries like a puncture in the side of a ship. It\u2019s sweet. Fresh. Like the inside of a pastry.\n\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d you comment.\n\n\u201cWay to understate it, kid,\u201d Redding says, plucking more berries from the bush. You take a few more for the road. Today you\u2019ll arrive at the Blackbird war camp. They assembled an entire war party to march on the outsiders, tek\u2019usans, who disturbed a sacred resting place. You\u2019ve burned bridges with both superpowers from the Old World and can\u2019t rely on their support. You doubt even Prinn, a childhood friend with whom you\u2019ve survived much, would come to your aid. That is, if he even recognized you. You arrived in the New World with a thousand soldiers as your allies, traded them for the Magda garrison, and now you stand with a single Blackbird woman to count as an ally.\n\n(Don\u2019t forget me!)\n\nAnd now you stand with a single Blackbird woman and a mouthy...voice as allies.\n\n(You\u2019re too kind.)\nBe serious for a moment. Are we rushing to our doom?\n\nA pause.\n\n(I know not. In my current form, I\u2019ve been passed from user to user. Spent centuries as a royal heirloom, given from father to son. There are only a small number that I\u2019ve bonded with. Those who I bond with hold possession far longer than the others.)\nYeah, possessing a gun with endless bullets tends to preserve one\u2019s life.\n(And this is what you heroes live for, is it not?)\nDon\u2019t call me--\n(--your type lives for odds stacked against them, a lone man against an army, standing against the onslaught of enemies.)\nSounds romantic and all, but I'd much rather have an army at my back.\n(Well, you don\u2019t.)\nWell, I don\u2019t.\n\nThe voice turns quiet, almost reflective. You draw closer to the Blackbird war camp. It\u2019s not their traditional home, at least that\u2019s what E\u2019ffy makes it sound like. Rather, it\u2019s a temporary dwelling to unify as a war party, ready to mobilize at a moment\u2019s notice. It\u2019s around midday, just past, when you arrive. This close to the war camp, you\u2019re surprised that you haven\u2019t run into any warriors. They must be watching though. There\u2019s no way three people are allowed to wander this close without several eyes, and likely arrows, pointed in the direction.\n\nThe land itself bears the dense overgrowth that you\u2019ve grown (ha) to expect from the New World. No stranger to military camps, the Blackbird\u2019s presence is unexpected, or rather, their lack of presence. The numbers that you fought at the garrison were a significant amount. Holding that many members in one place should be telling in the environment around it, heavily marched trails, lessened wildlife noise, the occasional discarded item or smoke. Nothing here. Unless E\u2019ffy was leading you here, you\u2019d have no idea you\u2019re able to stumble upon hundreds of Blackbird warriors.\n\nTwisting vines run across the path you take, mirroring tree roots that have rampantly grown underfoot, poking their heads up from underneath the ground. Then, a rush of water. It\u2019s soft at first, barely heard through the trees. With each step it gets louder, a steady crsssh of white noise. The air itself becomes misty, like that of a morning dew. The jungle opens up to a clearing not much more than ten feet deep.\n\n\u201cGods above,\u201d Redding blasphemes under his breath.\n\nDirectly across from the cliff\u2019s edge, a large waterfall crashes down to a pool of water, the impact of the water creating white mist. The waterfall itself gracefully falls from a sheer cut of blackened rock, the color of rock that you\u2019d imagine seeing next to a volcano. Jagged edges guide the waterfall, sharp edges that frame either side like armed guards escorting a prisoner of war. Surrounded by green, the blackrock waterfall is a deadly oasis in the New World forest, a clearing in the woods, the eye of the storm.\n\n\u201cThe camp is here?\u201d you comment, eyes glued to the water like the way one stares into a fireplace and the flames that dance within.\n\n\u201cYou will see,\u201d E\u2019ffy answers with a smile. She steps to the cliff\u2019s edge with both arms outstretched. \u201cMay the Raven protect us in flight.\u201d She waves you and Redding to imitate her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re--you\u2019re not going to leap, are you?\u201d you ask, glancing down. It must be at least a hundred feet straight down.\n\n\u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d E\u2019ffy asks.\n\n\u201cLadies first,\u201d you answer without a beat, arms similarly outstretched in flight position. Redding simply shakes his head, but also does the same.\n\n\u201cTake a deep breath, close your eyes, and--\u201d\n\nA hand at your back. And suddenly you\u2019re falling, falling, falling...\n\n...and land on your back not two feet behind the cliff\u2019s edge, pulled down by E\u2019ffy\u2019s grip at the back of your shirt. A dazed look shines on Redding\u2019s face before the patented grin appears. It\u2019s brief, but you catch it. You probably have the same look on your face minus the grin. E\u2019ffy\u2019s laugh fills the air, a womanly tone mixed with childlike glee.\n\n\u201cIt is a common trick we play on coming of age warriors. \u2018In order to test your loyalty, jump.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and did we pass the test?\u201d Redding utters under his breath.\n\nE\u2019ffy shrugs.\n\n\u201cSo how do we get to the camp then?\u201d You try to get things back on track. For the mission that you\u2019re on, you\u2019re finding it strange that you need to. Chalk it up to words lost in translation or something like that. The clashing of cultures. Men and women...that one\u2019s a bit more of a stretch.\n\n\u201cI will show you,\u201d E\u2019ffy says, back to being serious. \u201cThe path leads down here.\u201d\n\nOff in the distance, not nearly close to \u201chere,\u201d there\u2019s a break in trees. The overgrowth parts just enough for several bodies to pass through side by side. It appears to be a natural break; there aren\u2019t signs of Blackbirds chopping away at vines, branches, and bushes, not that you\u2019d expect them to anyway. The natives are much in tune with the New World\u2019s overgrowth, and even though you aren\u2019t completely understanding of their religion and customs, you\u2019re fairly certain taking an axe to the jungle for a simple walkway isn\u2019t something they\u2019re keen on doing.\n\nAs you pass through the break, the air itself feels different. Cooler. Fresher. The first breath is like that of walking in the night air after being tightly packed in an alehouse for hours, the difference between icy spring water and water that\u2019s been left in your waterskin for days. Of course the war party would reside here. If you had a choice, you would too. The path leads downhill, twisting, spiraling. Overhead, tree branches hang across the path, meeting in the middle, touching those on the opposite sides creating a tunnel-like feel. It\u2019s like you\u2019re being led along the path. Sure, you could stop; you could turn around, but you don\u2019t want to.\n\n\u201cYou feel it too,\u201d E\u2019ffy says. \u201cThe Raven\u2019s embrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel something, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d you comment back.\n\nSharp shadows grace the path downward, sunlight managing to pierce through the canopy and the tunnel ceiling in small specks at a time, like glittering diamonds, highlighting the darkness of the trees, their trunks and branches a deep brown, a solid foundation for the sea of green to grow upon. The three of you subconsciously step lightly so as not to disturb the peaceful aura that lives here, as if the sound of your boots on dirt will send the calming path into chaos. The creek was once peaceful too. Now it\u2019s littered with the dead.\n\nThe path opens into a poolside clearing, a meadow of sorts. Tall grass, at least a variant of grass, stands between the path and the waterfall\u2019s pool. Small flowers grow on the long blades of grass in various colors, red, yellow, and purple, the white crash of waterfall mist their backdrop, a blank canvas on which the meadow can paint its colors against. There\u2019s a cool breeze, one that you weren\u2019t expecting at the base of a waterfall. It\u2019s light, comforting, unlike an annoying wind that can\u2019t help but blow strands of hair out of place. E\u2019ffy leads you through the meadow. The path is a direct path through, straight as an arrow. It leads to another part of the jungle, the overgrowth beginning against where the meadow rudely interrupted its flow. After a single bend, you see where she\u2019s taking you.\n\nA cave sits dead ahead, its rock the same black as the waterfall falls from, the mouth of the cave itself far blacker, the kind of black that bears no contrast, no structure. SImply, black, an endless void absent of color. Your mind draws back to your dream. The cave. The sacrifice. The artifact stolen. A premonition, perhaps? Or the mind filling in gaps. Who\u2019s to say dreams have real impact, actual influence on reality. The mind does at it pleases, often taking you along for the ride. In battle it\u2019s the opposite way, however. The flow state takes over, putting the mind as a passenger along for the ride, instinct and training taking command.\n\n\u201cYou got a light, miss?\u201d Redding breaks the silence.\n\n\u201cIn a way,\u201d E\u2019ffy answers. You\u2019re starting to realize that she likes hiding things. Tricks, misdirection, they seem to excite her. It can\u2019t be a Blackbird thing, not that you\u2019ve actually spoken to any other native still living. There\u2019s no way you can imagine the warriors you slew playing practical jokes, although it could be the setting of battle. Either way, you\u2019re sure to find out soon. Hopefully their sense of humor isn\u2019t executing two outsiders for disturbing a sacred burial place. It wouldn\u2019t be the best of humor, but they\u2019re damn sure to have the last laugh in that scenario. All the laughs, in fact, minus a chuckle or two from Redding, perhaps.\n\nE\u2019ffy whispers under her breath, bringing her palms to her lips. It looks as if she\u2019s whispering in the ear, sharing a well-kept secret to her hands. You\u2019re unable to decipher what she\u2019s saying. A second later, ravenlight emanates from her palms. She takes the lead, both hands turned towards the ceiling, sending the area around her in a dark purple glow, your bodies at least; the cave itself remains black, not even the ravenlight can soften the void.\n\nIt\u2019s into the void E\u2019ffy walks, you and Redding closely behind. Whatever hides in the shadows of the cave will soon be revealed.", "action_results": [{"action": "The war camp", "result": "Light appears in the distance, a long-lost ally that has been absent for some time, other than the glow at E\u2019ffy\u2019s palms, that is. It\u2019s a shade that\u2019s burned into your memory. A dark purple, almost black glow. Ravenlight. It brings structure to the darkness. Contrast. Now, you can see what lies ahead, at least more than a few around E\u2019ffy. The tunnel gradually becomes less narrow, opening up into a wide section that could fit an entire Alteran company side-by-side in your estimate. Dark green vines, mostly unrecognizable, grow on the walls. Seems even within the caves of the New World things are growing. The ravenlight grows in luminosity. Dark figures appear in front of you. Blackbird warriors.\n\nEach wears an axe on both hips. Each stands a full head taller than you.\n\n\u201cHave you captured these tek\u2019usans all on your own, priestess?\u201d one says. He speaks in the articulate tone that you\u2019ve come to expect from the natives.\n\n\u201cNo. They are free,\u201d E\u2019ffy says. \u201cHe is the bondsman. Amir\u2019sshan has chosen.\u201d\n\nYou know a cue when you see one. You pull the artifact into view, spiraling the dagger around the palm of your hand a few times. Unlike most daggers, it doesn\u2019t flash with being brought into light, ravenlight or natural. Rather, it shines with true darkness, the cave around it simply an imposter darkness shying away from the black mithril.\n\n\u201cAre...are you sure?\u201d the other Blackbird speaks. You\u2019re not used to such timidity from the natives. His tone reminds you of a child asking a parent to visit a friend\u2019s home.\n\nYou didn\u2019t miss the first cue and you sure as hell aren\u2019t going to miss the second. Small thunderclouds. Black smoke, true black smoke, appears in the darkness of the cave. The artifact becomes a weapon that the blackbirds would recognize--well, that they would appreciate. The blade transforms into an axe head, keeping the same wing-tipped handle, although it grows in length to keep balance with the axe.\n\n(Looking for a round of applause, hero?)\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy, Terr\u2019ok is not going to like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr us letting you pass,\u201d the other inputs.\n\n\u201cThen take it up with my father,\u201d E\u2019ffy quickly answers. She seemed to have that one locked and loaded like an Alteran flintlock, standard issue. Double-barreled. It\u2019s definitely not the first and probably won\u2019t be the last time the priestess got her way by involving her father, whoever he may be. You can\u2019t help but notice the threat was backed by tribal standing rather than religious. Although being a priestess, even for an older sect, she does not use that to get her way. Whoever her father may be holds more influence than her status as a priestess.\n\n\u201cWe hold no quarrel with Chieftain Malic\u2019ant. Pass through, quickly. And do not mention our names.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, brothers,\u201d E\u2019ffy says and waves you forward. Redding flashes a smile towards the pair of warriors as you pass. They don\u2019t return the gesture. After passing by the initial scouts, you come across four more checkpoints, each one holding more Blackbird warriors than the last. The encounters are handled similarly, each one becoming more smooth than the last now that you know the questions asked and the answers to get waved through. The resemblance between the way the warriors act compared with the chain of command of Alteran is uncanny. In an entire New World, men know their places and aren\u2019t willing to risk upsetting the CO, commanding officer, above them in rank. The High King loves his chain of command, sure; the Blackbirds appear to love it as well. And at the top, rules E\u2019ffy, with her father, Chieftain Malic\u2019ant\u2019s name on the tip of her tongue.\n\nThe path opens up into a--cavern would be the wrong way to describe it, not that it wouldn\u2019t be completely inaccurate. It\u2019s essentially a large city, albeit underground. It\u2019s a large a space that you\u2019ve seen; the ceiling itself can\u2019t even be witnessed. The top lies somewhere above where the abundance of ravenlight can\u2019t even reach. It might be a few feet in the darkness. It might be five-hundred. Like the opposite of a deep body of water, the height of the ceiling is endless. Ravenlight is in abundance, but you see very few actual torches.\n\n\u201cThe plants,\u201d E\u2019ffy explains. \u201cThey blossom light.\u201d\n\nSure enough, as you\u2019re becoming accustomed to in the New World--even underground--plants are everywhere. Here, however, they are root-like vines that touch every building and structure, which themselves are built from stone blocks. The Alterans may consider the natives a primitive people compared to their own \u201ccivilized\u201d culture, but there\u2019s no denying the Blackbirds aren\u2019t the stone hut simpletons that they\u2019re made out to be...even though their houses may be stone huts. The huts themselves are circularly built, like a large version of a Magda buckler.\n\nThere are less of them than you imagined. The war party that attacked the garrison was large in number, yes, and it appears that they didn\u2019t have any reserve soldiers. Which makes you wonder if the Blackbirds lack military strategy. Perhaps. They stand taller and physically stronger than the average Alteran. Put together, though, the formations of Alteran are an impenetrable shield, and on the offensive, a dagger piercing between links of armor. You see warriors helping with daily chores, a few watering domesticated animals, harvesting rows of planted food. Only in the New World could one farm underground.\n\n\u201cThis way. To the temple.\u201d\n\nYou and Redding allow E\u2019ffy to lead you to the temple. Everywhere you look, eyes are fixed upon you. It\u2019s eerie in a sense. All attention is drawn towards you; it\u2019s as if you\u2019re walking through the hallways of the High King\u2019s palace buck naked. Most hold confused stares, others look as if they want to draw their axes here and now. Under E\u2019ffy\u2019s protection, you guess that would be a big disobedience of their laws. Lucky you. You\u2019re not sure what exactly you were expecting or how she planned to remove the S\u2019umbra from the equation, but you didn\u2019t imagine waltzing directly through the center of their war camp, which itself, doesn\u2019t much keep to the \u201cwar\u201d part of war camp.\n\nThe temple\u2019s in the corner of the war camp, built against the wall of the \u201ccavern\u201d itself. Like the other buildings, it\u2019s built from stone with round walls. There\u2019s an outer layer. An outer and inner sanctum of sorts. You pass through the unguarded gate, not much more than an open doorway leading into a series of altars and mats lying on the floor. It bears resemblance to the halls of the dead, the mats are the same, even the altar looks like the one where you first discovered the ravenlight torch many days ago.\n\nThe inner sanctum is an empty room, built, unsurprisingly at this point, like the tomb where you battled the lich, although instead of a sarcophagus, a large stone altar lies in the center, the rest of the room arranged around it. It\u2019s empty minus a frail-looking Blackbird dressed in a tattered brown robe. The man looks about your height, a runt for the natives. Rather than the long braided hair of the warriors you\u2019ve faced--even E\u2019ffy wears a single braid, the Blackbird has his black hair cut bowl-like, as if shaped like the huts of the war camp.\n\n(A few nails missing in the construction of this one, I think.)\nYou know, we might actually agree here for once.\n\n\u201cMy priestess! You can not allow these, these, these...outsiders to enter into such a holy place!\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm down, Onng. These are our guests,\u201d E\u2019ffy answers with a practiced patience that you\u2019re sure she\u2019s built up over a timespan spent with the man. His name is Onng. By the High King\u2019s pristine chamber pot, even the man\u2019s name is different from the other natives.\n\n\u201cIf the others learn of this\u2026this, abomination! Then they will surely force us from serving the Raven.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will do no such thing,\u201d E\u2019ffy says with a casual demeanor, like that of swatting a buzzing fly.\n\nRedding strides up to Onng. No stranger to peculiarity, he offers a hand in greeting. \u201cOnng, is it? You can call me Redding. And you can call him,\u201d he points to you. \u201cYou can call him--\u201d\n\n\u201cI will call you outsiders, is what I will call you,\u201d Ongg cuts him off before you can be properly introduced. He seems to take pride in his words as a great big ol\u2019 smile appears at his mouth, highlighting a few gaps within his teeth.\n\n\u201cYou will call them guests and nothing more,\u201d E\u2019ffy says as if scolding a child for not getting into bed on time.\n\n\u201cAll right, \u2018guests.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you kindly,\u201d Redding answers, taking a sweeping bow, a gesture that Onng tries to imitate.\n\nE\u2019ffy laughs. \u201cOnng has been serving the Raven since birth. His parents...are not with us.\u201d What started out as a friendly statement quickly turned sour. \u201cMake yourself comfortable. There is food and drink over there. (She points to another doorway at the end of the room.)\n\n\u201cWith respect,\u201d you say. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather hear of your plan to defeat the false priests before settling in. I don\u2019t think I could be \u2018comfortable\u2019 otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are WHAT?\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy ignores the outburst from Onng. Probably something she\u2019s used to doing. \u201cAre you sure? It would be good to replenish your energy.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Refuse", "result": "\u201cSo let\u2019s hear it,\u201d you say, resting on one of the floor mats. Man it feels good to take a load off. There\u2019s been a good deal of walking over the past few days; a lot of exertion ever since arriving to the New World and getting rained upon, likely from the very Blackbirds that you share a camp with now.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d E\u2019ffy asks, innocently.\n\n\u201cThe plan,\u201d you snap back, a little annoyed. Instantly, Ongg\u2019s face curls into a frown. It looks like a small mutt trying to be menacing to a war hound. \u201cHow we are going to remove the S\u2019umbra from their clutch over the tribes, how we are going to free your people to live by their own chieftain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is simple,\u201d E\u2019ffy starts, \u201cwe issue a challenge by the ways of Harri\u2019katan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is\u2026\u201d Redding prods with his question.\n\n\u201cThey do not know, priestess,\u201d Onng whispers. E\u2019ffy ignores the man.\n\n\u201cHarri\u2019katan, once the prized jewel of our people,\u201d E\u2019ffy says. \u201cImagine a city the size of a nation, built from the very earth itself. These are our ancestors. They drove the outsiders west many centuries ago. (Redding nods his agreement). But they have fallen from favor. Our people, the Harri\u2019ar are lost. It is the S\u2019umbra leading them astray. Without the false priests, they will revisit the laws of tradition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect,\u201d you say. \u201cThat does not explain it at all. And you mean to call the laws of an ancient city? Isn\u2019t the point to allow the tribes to rule themselves no longer under the thumb of the S\u2019umbra?\u201d\n\n\u201cEach tribe has a choice. We are stronger united by the Raven.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re becoming a little frustrated at this point, with good reason. E\u2019ffy seems to be taking you round and round with her logic. \u201cThen what the hell are we doing? Exchanging one leader for another? If it is freedom that your people want, then they should take it themselves, not surrender themselves to the yoke of servitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would do best to soften your tone in a holy place such as this,\u201d E\u2019ffy hisses. Her face turns from a sunny sky into approaching storm clouds.\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy,\u201d Redding speaks in a calm tone. \u201cTell us about the challenge.\u201d\n\nThe storm clouds hold a moment, but linger. An overcast priestess answers Redding. \u201cA challenge issued, the challenger must run the trial. If they survive, then they must face the ruler\u2019s champion.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d You intentionally shift your tone after your initial words, hard as it may be in your current state. \u201cWhat entails the trial?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gauntlet of the gods,\u201d E\u2019ffy says. \u201cThe challenger must prove they are worthy among the divine before they can face the champion in combat. Otherwise the greatest warrior would always rule.. and only hold it for as long as their strength allowed it. The ruler must be strong, but also chosen. They must win over the people before being considered.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what exactly is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA sacred tunnel in these caves. It is no accident that the war camp has taken place here. My father had some influence in the matter.\u201d This brings a smile to E\u2019ffy\u2019s lips. The weather changes quickly in her presence.\n\n\u201cAnd what lies within the tunnel?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d she answers. \u201cThe trial hasn\u2019t been run in many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 when was the last time it was won?\u201d Redding inputs.\n\n\u201cGenerations.\u201d\n\n(You know the simpler plan would be to stroll into the S\u2019umbra\u2019s hut and allow me to...talk with them.)\nAnd what would that solve? Those loyal would take their place.\n(A show of strength. That you are above their laws.)\nSomehow I don\u2019t think that would help the Blackbirds any.\n(It\u2019d help you...and the priestess. You have, what do they say, bigger fish to fry?)\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d E\u2019ffy says.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the kid,\u201d REdding jumps in. \u201che tends to do that when the artifact whispers to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmir\u2019sshan\u2026\u201d E\u2019ffy utters, in awe. \u201cWhat does he say?\u201d\n\n(I\u2019m flattered, but you don\u2019t need to ask for my permission.)\n\n\u201cHe says that we could end the S\u2019umbra without the challenge. With the artifact--err, Amir\u2019sshan--we have all the firepower we need to remove the S\u2019umbra from their place of rule. I ended the undead defender with a single bullet. I could do the same for these priests of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmir\u2019sshan, brutally straightforward as always.\u201d\n\nShe speaks as if she knows you.\n(They all do. I\u2019m somewhat of a legend myself.)\nEnough of a legend to justify executing a sect of native priests?\n(Not all legends are heroes, hero.)\n\n\u201cThe way I see it, is that we have two options presented in front of us,\u201d Redding says, taking on a familiar tone that you\u2019re used to hearing as he addresses the company. \u201cTake the difficult path leading into a treacherous tunnel, unknown danger hiding in the shadows. Or we can do what we soldiers do best: draw blood and keep drawing until it no longer flows.\u201d\n\n(I know what I vote for.)\nGood thing you don\u2019t get one.\n\n\u201cThose in favor of the trial?\u201d Redding asks. E\u2019ffy raises a hand in her decision. Onng, seeing his priestess\u2019 gesture, quickly raises his own palm. \u201cAnd those for the direct approach?\u201d Redding raises his hand while speaking. He waits for you to raise yours.\n\n\u201cAmir\u2019sshan counts as two,\u201d E\u2019ffy says. \u201cEven if it goes against my own belief. I would not choose against Amir\u2019sshan in anything other than this,\u201d she affirms. \u201cIn this, I am set. The Raven guide us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, tiebreaker?\u201d Redding says, his hand still raised. \u201cThe trial or the soldier\u2019s approach?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "The trial", "result": "Before you can answer, a loud knock appears on the door, a dull thud echoing just twice; the door swings open instantly upon the second knock, the newcomer(s) not willing to wait for someone to answer. It\u2019s a temple, after all. The fact that they\u2019re knocking on the door is as puzzling as only knocking twice, as opposed to the civil Alteran three, maybe four knocks.\n\nA lone man enters the temple. He may enter alone, but you see Blackbird warriors, escorts, in the outer sanctum. The man is dressed in dark purple robes, tattered at the edges. A deep hood rests lightly on the crown of his head, deep enough to hide the features of his face if pulled low. It doesn\u2019t take the option, however. Here, in the war camp, you doubt it\u2019s ever utilized for such a purpose. Hard to hide from those who already know your face. Thus enters Terr\u2019ok, high priest of the S\u2019umbra, acting chieftain of chieftains of the Harri\u2019ar, enemy of E\u2019ffy.\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy, my girl,\u201d he purrs, a voice that would be soothing coming from anyone but the current man in front of you. He\u2019s far younger than you imagined, likely not having forty years to his name. The wisdom he, perhaps, would have gained with more years is replaced with the prime of youth, both in mental capacity and physical prowess, something that normally isn\u2019t attributed to a man of the cloth. Terr\u2019ok rests on a wooden staff, a raven carved at the very top.\n\n\u201cTerr\u2019ok,\u201d E\u2019ffy confirms his identity. Tare-ock. \u201cHave you come here seeking salvation?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, my dear, that has already been secured for me. Yours, however\u2026\u201d He speaks differently than the other Blackbirds. The Blackbirds you\u2019ve heard speak all have used short, articulate words. Terr\u2019ok\u2019s, however, draws his words out, sliding them into one another like the oral version of a diplomat\u2019s signature.\n\n(END HIM HERE! Draw me. Put six bullets in his head. He-he. Oh yes, make him bleed. Bleed! BLEEEEED.)\n\nThe strength of the voice collapses you to your knees, both hands clutching on either side of your head. Pain. It\u2019s as if someone fired a flintlock next to both ears, then whipped you across the back of the head. An incoherent groan escapes your lips as Onng, surprisingly, rushes to your side and helps you back to your feet.\n\n\u201cSuch is the strength of those in opposition to a true devotee of the Raven!\u201d Terr\u2019ok points the ravenhead staff towards you, who currently lean against, again--surprisingly, Onng for support. \u201cSuch is the strength of the tek\u2019usan you would call ally.\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy glares at the high priest; the storm clouds approaching again, threatening to shower the world in rainfall and lightning. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to see the tek\u2019usan that you have brought under the protection of your flimsy wings.\u201d You notice the play on words. Typically the phrase is brought under the protection of the Raven\u2019s protective wing. A clever one, this Terr\u2019ok.\n\n(Stand. Rise. Draw me. Cut. His.Throat.)\n\n\u201cAnd this is the bondsman?\u201d Terr\u2019ok turns his attention towards you. You\u2019re currently wishing that E\u2019ffy didn\u2019t tell every Blackbird warrior from here to Alteran that the artifact bonded with you. \u201cThe one that Amir\u2019sshan chose? He is the mad-god, indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut!\u201d E\u2019ffy bursts with a finger pointed at the door. \u201cYou do not come into a sacred place and blaspheme. You know better, high priest.\u201d\n\nIs that really so offensive?\n(Blood must be spilled. It is justified.)\n...I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\n\n\u201cMy sincerest apologies, priestess. I look forward to our next meeting. \u201cTerr\u2019ok performs a haphazard bow, turns, and leaves. Through the door, you see the two Blackbird warriors tail closely behind the high priest, each flanking one side of the man. You continue leaning on Onng for a few moments before strength returns to your body. It\u2019s quiet in the temple, its inhabitants still registering the sudden confrontation of the man you plan to kill. He dare visit you unarmed, leaving his escort outside? Either it\u2019s overconfidence or he knew something you didn\u2019t, a thought that E\u2019ffy confirms.\n\n\u201cIt is good you did not try to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a little busy,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cI was not talking to you,\u201d she says, looking at Redding. \u201cTerr\u2019ok had many unseen protections around him. Your weapons would have had no effect on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of them, I suppose,\u201d Redding answers, gesturing at the artifact. \u201cWhat the hell was that? You\u2019re not one to get jumpy before battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe voice was screaming at me. It was like someone was hammering nails into my skull,\u201d you say. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem...all together there.\u201d You\u2019re careful to avoid words such as \u201cinsane\u201d or the Raven forbid, \u201cmad.\u201d You saw the way it set E\u2019ffy off, even speaking on it now makes you nervous.\n\n\u201cWhat was it saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wanted me to kill Terr\u2019ok.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will answer for what he has done. But we will defeat him by honorable means,\u201d E\u2019ffy affirms.\n\nRedding counters. \u201cHonorable means don\u2019t exist in war, only the victorious and the defeated.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-we have a path forward,\u201d Ongg gathers the foursome back together. \u201cL-l-let us stick to it.\u201d\n\nThe man with obvious ailments refocuses you. Funny how someone with apparent shortcomings, a mind stunted, can speak the exact words needed. A path was determined, its beginning interrupted by the sudden appearance of Terr\u2019ok, but it\u2019s still in motion. It\u2019s what you believe to be the best chance at defeating the priests. And it will be the first of many victories, for your journey does not end with the Blackbirds, despite your feeling that you\u2019re nearing the end of this chapter. As a whole, the journey\u2019s only just starting out.\n\n(You missed your chance.)\nWasn\u2019t much of one with your impairment.\n(Promise me one thing.)\nWhich is...?\n(You\u2019ll use me to end the man\u2019s life.)\nI promise. Why do you hate the priest?\n(Your oath binds us. I am not simply bonded to you. But now you to me. I will reveal all when the sun sets.)", "action_results": [{"action": "Path forward", "result": "The path set forward, the rest of the day is largely uneventful. Preparation is in order, and there are no more surprise visitors. That said, there\u2019s tension in the camp. You may not understand much of the Blackbird--the Harri\u2019ar--people, but there\u2019s an uneasiness that hangs in the air, affecting the way natives walk, talk, and to a degree, stare. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re afraid to show any sort of support, while at the same time afraid to show any lack of support.\n\nTrue neutrality.\n\nThey almost don\u2019t deserve your actions. You are risking life and limb to free them from blindly following the S\u2019umbra; but you\u2019ve forgotten how much people like to be blindly led, a responsibility-less life where the weight of decisions are not cast upon their shoulders. It\u2019s no way to live; despite your many wrong choices, it\u2019s led you here, and having your life story placed on a narrow path is one of the worst fates you can imagine for a person, a life as decaying tree, absent of any branches.\n\nDinner ends up being New World rice, an unidentified type of meat, wrapped in a flat tortilla, different colorful vegetables chopped and sprinkled within. Whatever the meat is, or whatever it was seasoned with, burns like a strong whiskey in your throat. Spicy flavor isn\u2019t exactly common in Alteran. They prefer sweetness across the pond, and your unconditioned palate causes you to take to the wine glass a little more than you planned on--but that\u2019s how it usually works, isn\u2019t it? At the very least, the extra cup or two or three helped against thoughts wondering what type of meat you\u2019re eating. Some things are better left unknown.\n\nAs a foursome, you enjoy the company of one another. The unspoken fact is that it might be the last time you have the opportunity to. Tomorrow is when your plan goes into action; tonight, however, you\u2019ll enjoy the presence of both old and new friends, a journey that began in the Old and ended, well--found itself--in the New World. There is still much journey to be had, and who\u2019s to say that it ends here? After one chapter ends, another begins, for the story doesn\u2019t end simply because the words THE END appear in front of you. Like a play performed on stage, THE END isn\u2019t really that. The actors and actresses continue living, same with the audience. And afterward, the experience manifests itself within an individual, a silent but subtle whisper in the mind swaying decision and action; the same can be said for every story told, whether spoken or read.\n\nThese things shape you into who you are today, a former soldier in the New World at the center of a religious revolution with the native people of the New World. From a childhood that began in the High King\u2019s rival nation, a dual citizenship to opposing sides of the world\u2019s greatest superpowers, to a deserter, a champion of the Harri\u2019ar, bondsman of Amir\u2019sshan. Tomorrow will bring unfolding if your name is spoken with awe or accompanied with a ball of spit, the way Alterans hear the Supreme Leader\u2019s name mentioned.\n\nYou find yourself resting atop the temple. A, you guessed it, ladder, leads from the storeroom to a trap door. You can almost see the entire war camp from the vantage point. Countless ravenlight shines in the darkness, like stars in a cloudless night. Smoke trails upward from various huts, their inhabitants warm and fed, the people that you will free from tyranny. One by one your companions drift off to sleep, taking their leave of the rooftop first starting with Redding and then Onng. All that\u2019s left is you and E\u2019ffy. She sits on one hip, supporting herself upright with her hands, and you, cross-legged, forearms resting on your knees. There\u2019s no ravenlight near you, however, and the woman next to you lives in the shadows, a phantom of beauty in the night.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly quiet. The camp\u2019s all but winded down until morning. Blackbird warriors patrol, and that\u2019s about it. No stranger to patrol detail, you track their cadence, their route. It\u2019s not as rigid as militaries in the Old World. You\u2019re pretty sure one of the warriors stopped in a certain hut for evening pleasure. It makes you wonder if they walk the streets by choice rather than by command. It\u2019s mostly quiet. Typical sounds of the night don\u2019t cry out here, underground. No wild animals chirp or howl at the moon. No breeze gently whistles through tree leaves. It\u2019s simply dark and silent, absent of both moonlight and sound.\n\nYou\u2019re content to sit and enjoy the view in silence. The vantage point overlooking the Blackbird war camp is not an experience you\u2019ve had before, and you\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s one that you\u2019ll experience again. There\u2019s no telling what tomorrow may bring, which is not a completely unheard of statement, although you\u2019re certain it originated from circumstances such as this, a plan set forward into motion, surely defeat meaning death. For the first time in what feels like years, maybe ever, you\u2019re at peace. There\u2019s a specific reassurance that comes from knowing one\u2019s path, unencumbered by the corruption of the unknown. Rather than a faceless enemy, you know who would plant the dagger in your back, a position much more affirming than it sounds. Belly full, head tipsy. Not a bad way to spend an evening.\n\nFinally E\u2019ffy breaks the silence. \u201cThe end draws near.\u201d\n\nShe sure knows the right words to ruin the moment. But the priestess isn\u2019t wrong. Perhaps it would be good to think of tomorrow and the possibilities it brings. Perhaps it would be better to simply enjoy the present moment. There\u2019s too much planning in a lifetime, and not enough time spent in the quiet present, a fleeting thing like the wind passing by.\n\nBut still, that does not mean you have to completely ignore the upcoming confrontation. Presence doesn\u2019t demand the forsaking of the future. It\u2019s the means to bring you there, after all. \u201cThe end of one thing. Another will take its place.\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy turns to you. Her eyes sparkle in the distant ravenlight, a shade of black, usually void of such shimmering. \u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the course of all things?\u201d you ask, but then quickly continue. You\u2019re not sure how well the native would understand the rhetoric. \u201cStages of life are like a wheel and people are often caught up in a specific spoke. There\u2019s another after that. And another. And another\u2026 Removing Terr\u2019ok and the S\u2019umbra from their hold over the tribes is only the beginning. I--Redding and I--plan to do the same with our people who are journeying to the New World.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are more of you coming.\u201d The priestess doesn\u2019t word it as if it is a question. She probably didn\u2019t need an explanation on the rhetoric then. \u201cThey will be sent west with the others. This is our land.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing at a time, E\u2019ffy,\u201d you answer. \u201cI have no doubts that your people will try. If the tribes are no longer united, though, will they have enough strength to stand against...them?\u201d You almost said us. That, certainly, would have caused some problems.\n\n\u201cYou arrived on the latest wooden horses. How did that turn out for you?\u201d\n\nThe arrival. Fire raining from the sky. Ships fell beneath the sea. Those who couldn\u2019t swim, drowned. Fair enough. You voice it.\n\n\u201cFair enough. I was there at the garrison though, when the war party attacked the soldiers in red. They were beaten back, and that is only a garrison. Imagine if it were an entire regiment. The war party itself might not have survived. What then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raven will guide us. He always does.\u201d\n\nYou take the chance to ask a question that\u2019s been burning in your mind. \u201cThe artifact has something to do with the Raven, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIn the shadows, you see E\u2019ffy\u2019s head bop up and down in response.\n\n\u201cAnd the voice that speaks through it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome say it is the Raven. Others say it is his son, the Raven incarnate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you believe?\u201d\n\nThe white of the priestess\u2019 teeth shine in the dark. \u201cI believe it is him. The S\u2019umbra know it as well, and that is why they trapped Amir\u2019sshan in his prison. They know the tribes will follow the Raven. They use his name to bring power to themselves. With Amir\u2019sshan trapped, he can not retaliate. Until now. Until the bondsman does something about it.\u201d\n\nThe High King of Alteran may not be a deity, although often it seems like that when speaking with a devout loyalist, but you can see the similarity. The symbolism, the similarities between the people of the New and the Old World are striking. You may practice different customs, but the same struggle for power is displayed eerily the same. All this has happened before and will happen again. Life itself is a wheel, always destined to return back to itself. Here, many thousands of miles away from Alteran, the same propaganda appears. It might as well be a billboard in an Alteran tavern wall stating You! The High King needs your service! The S\u2019umbra use the Raven as their billboard, and the common person mindlessly follows. Without intervention it\u2019ll continue down the path, unchanging. Until now. Until the bondsman does something about it.\n\nGot anything to say about any of this?\n(If I admit to who she says I am, does that make a difference?)\nIt makes a difference for my curiosity.\n(I won\u2019t share just to satisfy your curiosity.)\nYou know, you\u2019d think we\u2019d agree a lot more being \u2018bonded to one another.\u2019\n(You\u2019d think.)\n\n\u201cYou were quiet just now. What did Amir\u2019sshan say?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you know, the usual. The voice thinks one way, me another.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good that you are bonded.\u201d She smiles again. \u201cYou are good for each other. The power of a god and the grounding of a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cLady, if you partook in the constant inner debate, you might think otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me then,\u201d E\u2019ffy says, scooting closer to you. She moves next to you, the edge of her arm touching yours. It\u2019s subtle, but you both feel it. Subtle enough to claim ignorance if the other points it out. Neither does. When she speaks next, the air around you feels different, like her words themselves are imitating your touch. \u201cSpeak to me through Amir\u2019sshan. Let me hear the Raven\u2019s words.\u201d\n\n(...well?)\nYou better not disappoint her.\n(I was going to tell you the same exact thing.)\n\nYou turn towards E\u2019ffy, your face mere inches away. Her skin smells like the air before rain falls, the first refreshing breath of the morning. You draw the dagger and hold it in your palm. E\u2019ffy places her hand around yours, her skin like liquid silver, gentle as a lover\u2019s whisper in bed.\n\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d you find yourself saying, your heart beating like the way it does before entering the battlefield.\n\nShe squeezes your hand in response, a good enough answer as any. You will the artifact to speak. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nWell don\u2019t begin being quiet now. That\u2019s something you should have started days ago. The minor insult does the trick, as you knew it would.\n\n(It warms the heart to know there are still true devotees. I\u2019ve had to put up with this fellow) You find yourself rapping your chest with a finger. (But as far as bondsmen go, I could have done a lot worse.)\n\nE\u2019ffy\u2019s face lights up unlike you\u2019ve seen before. She\u2019s one to always display her emotion. Whatever she\u2019s feeling, you\u2019re going to see it on her face, minus the times she\u2019s being intentionally deceiving. The priestess does like her practical jokes. Her eyes widen to the size of a child\u2019s when a father returns home from war, gifts in hand. Her smile becomes that of a newly-labeled fiance, the words I do still hanging in the air. E\u2019ffy places a hand on your chest, as if feeling your heartbeat will bring her closer to her god.\n\n\u201cWe will rid the Harri\u2019ar of the ones who trapped you here, Amir\u2019sshan. You will reign again.\u201d\n\nWait. What? As soon as your distrustful thought appears, it vanishes. Her hand on your chest, you can think of nothing else. No battle. No shortcoming. No fear that lies in the future. Simply, the present. The two of you on a rooftop overlooking camp, shades of ravenlight scattered before you like shells on the seashore.\n\n(And you will be by my side.)\n\nThe words flow from your mouth, not of your own volition. Before you can question it, the world starts to spin from view. Blackness rolls in from the edge of your vision, guided like a river to a waterfall. Ravenblack shades swirl, mixing with one another, twisting and distorting in front of you, like the world spinning after a hefty session at the ale house. Blackness rolls in. Just as it overtakes you completely, the artifact whispers in your mind.\n\n(It\u2019s time you saw.)", "action_results": [{"action": "Amir'sshan, chieftain of chieftains", "result": "Long ago before the first outsiders arrived, the city of Harri\u2019katan was the world\u2019s greatest empire. Alteran wasn\u2019t even a thought in the founding member\u2019s minds, for they wouldn\u2019t come into existence for many centuries. There stood but one city, one nation of note: Harri\u2019katan. The city itself was built into the very forest of the New World, as if it grew naturally along with the trees, vines, and overgrowth that surrounded it, intertwined it, part of it. It stood a city, yes. But most cities aren\u2019t the size of entire nations. Take Magda and throw in a few territories of Alteran, and you have an idea of the size of Harri\u2019katan.\n\nThere, the people were united under a single banner. All the tribes of Harri\u2019ar were one. And not only were they allies in battle, they were family. You see, it\u2019s a simple matter to throw a bunch of young men in uniform, slap a sword in their hands, and say \u201ccharge!\u201d The goal is clearly defined. Battle forges bonds that a peaceful life simply cannot keep pace with, minus the occasional sick community member who finds themselves in an early grave. So, perhaps, it is not battle that forges bonds, but death, the only inevitability in life. Yet without the constant threat of death facing the Harri\u2019ar--a strange thing how it\u2019s always threatening, but it largely goes unaddressed--the tribes were united under one chieftain. The man-god. Amir\u2019sshan.\n\nAmir\u2019sshan, undefeated in a thousand battles. Amir\u2019sshan, a harem boasting a number greater than entire tribes. Amir\u2019sshan, chieftain of chieftains.\n\nThe odd thing was, no one can quite remember how Amir\u2019sshan took rule. He\u2019s been chieftain as long as the elders had been alive, longer even; the ancient ancestors knew of the man-god and spoke of him through story, passed down from generation to generation. The Raven incarnate, they said. Whether true or not, the chieftain has kept the same complexion for a thousand generations. Ageless. Timeless. Who\u2019s to say he is not the Raven\u2019s second coming.\n\nAn organization underground, that\u2019s who.\n\nBehold! The godkiller, a weapon of black mithril. It took a hundred years to recover the mithril ore needed to forge the weapon. The metal broke the most sturdy of blacksmith tools, sat in the fire of the forge like it was a cool bath. It took the magma of a volcano and the pressure of a waterfall to shape the mithril, but they did it. By the Father Sun above, they did it. A dagger, ravenblack blade, wing-tipped. The godkiller, infused with all the combined strength of all their faith, not to mention binding spells, auras, and holy magic.\n\nDeep in the utmost layer of Harri\u2019katan, they resided, beneath the slums, even. It didn\u2019t feel safe enough to the members, a council of nine. Eight of them were priests. One, a renown warrior in the city. That\u2019s the thing about religious authority. They have power over any individual, minus Amir\u2019sshan and his royal guard, who, interestingly, don\u2019t seem to be religious, despite their honor-bound duty to protect the man-god with their lives. Perhaps it\u2019s because their deity lives and breathes before them, walking the same stairs, the same hallway that they wander. Perhaps it\u2019s a more practical approach to reverence. They have a task, and they complete it to damn-near perfection.\n\nNot perfection, mind you. Enter, the godkiller.\n\nA starless night was when they came. Clouds covered the heavens from sight of their own, the man-god. At exactly the same moment, the poison in his guards\u2019 drinks took hold, the man-god\u2019s servants, which were actually the organization\u2019s servants, unlocked the hidden entrance. They took Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s palace in a great wave, his guards too affected by the poison to muster a fight. The suddenness of the attack, the ferocity of the assassins. Unmatched, in all history. They found the god-man sitting upon his throne, well, laying across his throne, sideways, like lounging on a couch.\n\nHis face is not that of a strong chieftain or prince. It\u2019s symmetrical, yes, without any malformed or unproportionate features. There\u2019s something about it though, off-putting. It\u2019s the face of a man who sets upon travelers mixed with the understanding eyes of a high priest. It\u2019s the face of a caring father, a drunk beggar in the street, the commander on a battlefield. Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s face may be symmetrical in shape, but it\u2019s far from balanced. When they breached his throne room, a place with arched ceilings as high as the eye can see, he paid them no mind. The assassins strode past each column, supporting beams thicker than any tree in the forest. When even reaching the first of the seven steps to the throne, he didn\u2019t glance up, simply examined his fingernails like they were the most interesting thing in the world.\n\n\u201cMy subjects,\u201d he spoke through a voice soft for a legend. \u201cHow polite of you to disturb your sleep in order to give me company.\u201d Amir\u2019sshan wore nothing but his a\u2019lta, a blanket-like garment tied around his waist. The chieftain\u2019s a\u2019lta was black with embroidered white. Without armor, the man-god left his chest exposed; his torso, lean muscle and tanned skin, unmarked with tattoos unlike most of the Harri\u2019ar.\n\nThe leader of the organization stepped forward. Rels\u2019umbra, his face shrouded beneath the shadow of his hood. With both hands curled around his staff, a raven carved at the top, the priest, the ringleader, the would-be assassin, spoke. \u201cYour rule is at an end, Amir\u2019sshan.\u201d\n\nHis lack of reverence was duly noted. It\u2019s been decades since Amir\u2019sshan hadn\u2019t been addressed by any number of his titles, least of all in the throne room itself. Violent executions have a way of solving matters of respect...or lack thereof. For a time, at least, until it united people to meet in the shadows, plotting one\u2019s downfall. Case in point, Rel\u2019sumbra and friends.\n\n\u201cIs it now,\u201d Amir\u2019sshan raised an eyebrow. It touches the tip of his chieftain\u2019s headdress, ravenblack feathers stretching down the sides of his face and back. \u201cMy chair and hat would speak otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe assassins remained steadfast. For they have grown to expect certain...oddities from their \u201cchieftain.\u201d\n\n\u201cA chieftain who doesn\u2019t age brings stagnation to a people. The Harri\u2019ar need a chieftain who was raised up with the people he rules. To understand their needs. Their struggles. You do not relate to the tribes. Once upon a time, perhaps, but you are too far removed. For the good of the Harri\u2019ar and the Raven\u2019s will, you must be removed. Will you go quietly?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you come quietly?\u201d Amir\u2019sshan swung his legs on the ground, sitting on the throne normally now, both elbows resting on his knees. \u201cHave you come with ulterior motives? Power? Someone has to take my place. Would it be you, Rel\u2019sumbra?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe council has decided, yes. I\u2019m to be your replacement. The Raven\u2019s will be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYOUR will be done,\u201d Amir\u2019sshan spat. \u201cYou are no more aligned with the Raven\u2019s will than the heretics who worship demons, transfixed by a small display of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou speak falsely. I can understand your frustration. It\u2019s no easy thing to surrender rule after such a span.\u201d\n\nA cruel grin appeared at Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s lips. \u201cYou speak falsely if you think I am surrendering rule.\u201d\n\nRel\u2019sumbra, calm as always, spoke beneath the shroud of his hood. \u201cI had a feeling you would say that.\u201d One hand left his ravenheaded staff and reached within his robe. The dagger he pulled, hiding underneath his robe, doesn\u2019t shine or gleam being brought into the light as most daggers would. Instead it seemed to eat the light, devouring rays normally cast into reflection. Recognition appears on Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s face, starting first with his eyes, widening larger than normal, then cascading down the rest, flaring nostrils, paralyzing lips, holding breath. Behold! The godkiller.\n\nAs quickly as recognition appeared, faster even, rage took its place, a righteous fury that arose during times of forced injustice. It\u2019s the flash of anger when learning about a loved one\u2019s rape, the heat that surfaces when shameful actions are exposed to the public eye. Quite a motivator, that. Paired with nine individuals who would remove the man-god from rule with a blade in his back\u2026 Yes, it\u2019d been many moon cycles since Amir\u2019sshan faced combat. No one dared challenge him. He had an army to conquer in his stead. He welcomed the battle back like a long lost friend. His oldest friend, returning. The man-god would share the joy with nine of his subjects.\n\nAmir\u2019sshan leaped from the throne, above the small steps that lead to it, and landed in the center of the nine, unarmed. His fists became a blur; Rel\u2019sumbra, with eyes dexterous as they come, could hardly keep up. Like one cloud melding into the next, edges undefined, Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s punches blended into the next. The unfortunate priest who Amir\u2019sshan focused on first likely didn\u2019t know which hand was raining upon him.\n\nRed mists of blood splashed in the air, showering on Amir\u2019sshan and the nearest assassins. The priest crumpled underneath the flurry, his back bending over first like a bridge, exposing his chest and throat to the world, to the man-god; his chest was caved in from the blows, like an inlet on the coast. A sickening snap. A sigh--at least something similar to it, the final breath left the priest\u2019s lungs, hanging in the air, sobering the other assassins. Do they not know? They seek to kill a god. Before the fight had even begun, one of their members lay dead, beaten to death in front of his allies.\n\nAt the sight of their dead, Rel\u2019sumbra and the other assassins acted. Holy magic spilled from the priests; the warrior, Gh\u2019enna, covered head to toe in black bone armor, charged, battle-axe raised high overhead. Amir\u2019sshan rolled to his left, a white bolt of magic landing in the place he stood a moment before, a white bolt that left behind a blackened scar on the stone floor. From nowhere, two blades came into existence in Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s hands, longswords that dwell beyond the void called--no, commanded--into service by the man-god, their edges translucent, ethereal.\n\nEither by Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s speed or the blurred sword edges, perhaps both, his blades seemed to double in number. Before Gh\u2019enna could bring his battle-axe down on the man-god, no less than ten cuts appeared on his legs, running up the length of his torso, the final one landing at his throat. The warrior staggered for a moment, the realization of his fatal wounds settling in. Then, in what would cause a cloud of dust on the battlefield, he collapsed backward with a solid thud. There was no dust cloud, however. Only emptiness and a traitorous warrior slain by the hand of his chieftain.\n\n\u201cThought this would be easy, did you?\u201d Thought you could take power for yourself, did you?\u201d Amir\u2019sshan spoke, walking towards the priests, sword points used in emphasis. Rel\u2019sumbra could see the edges of the blades now. By the Raven he could see them, for they were highlighted red with Gh\u2019enna\u2019s blood, a crimson stain on otherwise flawless weapons.\n\n\u201cMore still stand against your tyranny!\u201d Rel\u2019sumbra slammed the butt of his staff into the floor, his way of emphasizing his point. A small rumble echoed upon impact, the sound of the release of magic. Visible ripples spanned out from the staff, like that of throwing a rock into a pond. Amir\u2019sshan thought he heard the flutter of wings. The remaining priests, now six excluding Rel\u2019sumbra, screamed into the air. No, that\u2019s not right. They screeched, a primal tone as wild as any animal in the jungle.\n\nAncient, even compared to Harri\u2019katan, even compared to Amir\u2019sshan himself, magic flowed from Rel\u2019sumbra\u2019s ravenheaded staff. Before he had used holy magic to attempt to smite Amir\u2019sshan. If Gh\u2019enna didn\u2019t die instantly, he would have used it in healing. This magic is different, however. Far from the realm of holy, good, farther even than \u201cgray\u201d areas, the realm of morally ambiguous, a mixture of both holy and evil. The priests\u2019 hands curled in pain, in power. Fingers grasped at unseen objects in their palms, flexing their palms turned skyward. The very bones within their body seemed to reorient themselves, sickening cracks confirming the fact, bulging in various sections of their neck and limbs, threatening to burst from the very skin that contained them.\n\nBlack wisps of magic encircled the priests\u2019 feet, spiraling up their body like a poisonous snake wrapping itself around a tree branch. Ribbons of black magic hang in the air like sparks leaving the safety of their flame. Amir\u2019sshan noticed Rel\u2019sumbra was unaffected by the ancient power. As the black wisps spanned upward, covering the priests entirely in a dark shroud, Amir\u2019sshan spoke again.\n\n\u201cTyranny, you say. Perhaps you do deserve to rule. The way you volunteer those beneath you to sacrifice their body for the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey knew the cost and gladly paid it,\u201d Rel\u2019sumbra answered, both hands back on the staff. A casual posture for the way his allies screeched in pain not five feet away from his position. \u201cThe Harri\u2019ar are willing to lay down their life to remove you from rule. Can you say there are those willing to do the same to keep you here?\u201d\n\nAmir\u2019sshan muffled a laugh. The priests cry out in pain. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason you had to plot in the underground. You\u2019ve removed those from the equation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is their duty, not their belief.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two are mutually exclusive?\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough! Your time is at an end. For the good of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the good of Rel\u2019sumbra,\u201d Amir\u2019sshan corrected.\n\n\u201cThose two are mutually exclusive?\u201d Rel\u2019sumbra fired back.\n\n\u201cAhhh, now you\u2019re learning,\u201d Amir\u2019sshan said. Movement caught his eye, the dark wisps starting to vanish from sight, fading from existence the way spilled water evaporates after an amount of time. Upon subsiding, it revealed the abominations beneath.\n\nIn the place where hooded priests stood, bird-like creatures, tall as a man. Talons took the place where praying hands once did, also bursting through their boots. Their heads became the very Blackbird that they worship, the face of a raven staring back at Amir\u2019sshan, their hoods able to contain the transformation as well as their boots. Black beady eyes reorient themselves with their surroundings. Amir\u2019sshan knew the transformation never took place before, not with the specific men in front of him; it\u2019s a one-way journey designed to turn the tide in a single battle, in this case, to turn the tide against him.\n\nIt would not be enough.\n\n\u201cI noticed that you remain un--\u201d Amir\u2019sshan started to say before the ravenheaded priests leaped towards him. They had no wings, but possessed strength beyond that of Harri\u2019ar\u2019s greatest warrior...excluding the chieftain of chieftains, that is. To Rel\u2019sumbra\u2019s dismay, instead of fear, a smile crept across Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s face. It\u2019s the smile of a laborer as he took his first sip of evening ale. Subtle. Present. Six dark figures flew in the air towards Amir\u2019sshan, talons ready to carve the eyes from the chieftain\u2019s skull; six figures, to rip the innards from his body in a series of blasphemous strikes.\n\nIn a sight that future bondsmen would recognize, one of the translucent swords in Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s palm became a spear. Small thunderclouds. Black smoke. Transformation, the furthest thing from an abomination, far more graceful than the priests before him. It was meant to be. The sword was no longer meant to be a sword. It was meant to be a spear, and surrendered its form to the man-god. Then, quicker than the shape shift, quicker than the swords first appeared in his hands, it left Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s palm, singing a sinister whistle along its flight path.\n\nIt impaled the nearest priest through the chest--no, that\u2019s not accurate. It tore through the nearest priest, both spearhead and shaft passing through his body with no more ease than dipping an oar into water. It impaled the second nearest priest, stopping the momentum of his leap, reversing it entirely, skewering the former holy man against the wall like a proud banner sending glory and exaltation in bright colors.\n\nOne spear. Two dead. Four remaining.\n\nThey fell upon him, four abominations seeking blood. A funny thought occurred in Amir\u2019shhan\u2019s mind: in their eyes, he is the abomination. He might not have twisted his body into half bird, half man, but there\u2019s no denying his existence is unlike that of the Harri\u2019ar. The man-god, they called him, living for centuries, never aging, keeping the same complexion. There\u2019s something sure as hell unnatural about the man(-god) himself, yet it lies underneath the surface rather than expressing itself in the physical, at least not in the way that would capture the honest, if not rude, attention of a small child with the ability to point fingers. After a few generations, however\u2026 Small thunderclouds. Black smoke. The remaining weapon in his hand became a greatsword, two hands needed to swing with any strength behind the large blade.\n\nThe head of a Blackbird rolled to the floor, its body finding a few more steps before collapsing behind it. Like a headless chicken. Amir\u2019sshan can\u2019t contain it. \u201cHa-ha-ha-ha!\u201d His laughter is maddening to the remaining others. He\u2019s laughing. Laughing! As he cut through their ranks with no more ease than shaving in the morning. This was supposed to be their triumphant night, one that had been planned for years. The perfect night to (Amir\u2019sshan drove the point of his greatsword into another Blackbird. Two.) catch the chieftain unaware, exposed. Yet he considered their threat nothing more than a minor nuisance. Laughing.\n\nLaughing!\n\nLAUGHING!\n\nThunderclouds. A nine tailed whip now rested in the chieftain\u2019s palm. The swing caused a crack rivaling a real storm, snapping in the air like a bolt of lightning seeking a tree trunk, leaving behind a blackened husk of where life once stood. Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s whip left behind a similar figure. It took several swings, but the result was the same. Lifeless, hollow figures remained. A bolt of lightning possessed mercy. A single strike, and it\u2019s over. Quick. Painless. The opposite could be said for the man-god\u2019s nine tail. Unable to hide his glee, he overwhelmed the two harri\u2019ar with furious swings, each one marking their body with cuts. Soon they were unrecognizable, a four-limbed frame underneath a thousand bleeding cuts. The room was filled with the crack of the whip. And laughter. Plenty of laughter.\n\nAll his support dealt with, Amir\u2019sshan turned his attention towards Rel\u2019sumbra. Only the assassin is not there. Then where did\u2026 Pain bursted through the man-god\u2019s back. He holds no vision, yet images rush into his mind, Rel\u2019sumbra standing behind him, hand gripped firmly around the (godkiller!) black mithril dagger, seeking to drive it further into the exposed back of the chieftain, its blade already sunk deep into Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s lower back to the hilt. A coldness overtook Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s body, like stepping out from the safety of a warm hut into snowfall.\n\nUnsuccessfully, he tried reaching behind him to grab the dagger. The attempt caused Rel\u2019sumbra to twist--pain flashed. Thousands of years entered Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s mind, hanging a moment, before vanishing. Life. Love. Lost. He\u2019d been alive far longer than most. He\u2019d loved few in the timespan, all early on, for he quickly learned that they would die while he kept going. After his third love died, he cut himself from such emotion. Instead he built a harem, allowing the physical manifestation of such feelings to be quenched with women as replaceable as a blunt dagger. Never the same one more than a few times. Amir\u2019sshan couldn\u2019t trust himself to lay with the same one too often, otherwise he risked love rearing its ugly head, setting himself down a path that leads only to death. Lost. He\u2019d lost more than a man could ever seek to gain, even in his wildest imagination, loved ones only being a fraction of the loss.\n\nHot breath touched Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s ears in spoken word. Their tone, violent. \u201cThus ends the rule of Amir\u2019sshan, tyrant of the Harri\u2019ar. Your death will cause a parade in the streets. Tears of joy will fall. For tomorrow begins the rule of the just Rel\u2019sumbra. And after my lifespan, another will take my place. It is the natural order of things. You have stagnated our people for too long.\u201d\n\nAmir\u2019sshan forced a chuckle, which ended up being a cough of blood. \u201cPoor Rel\u2019sumbra. The people will follow whoever wears the headdress. They are sheep as afraid of their shepherd as wolves. Your ideology means nothing. Whether I lead or you lead, they care little...as long as you do not disturb their simple, boring lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll live without their gratitude. You on the other hand\u2026\u201d\n\nRel\u2019sumbra ripped the godkiller from the man-god\u2019s back. Amir\u2019sshan dropped to his knees. Soft hands grabbed for the chieftain\u2019s throat, hands unaccustomed to performing laborious tasks themselves. Before sliding the mithril dagger across Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s neck, the assassin pulled the chieftain\u2019s headdress from the crown of his head.\n\n\u201cFarewell, man-god.\u201d\n\nBefore the godkiller could bring finality to the evening\u2019s skirmish, Amir\u2019sshan briefly glanced heavenward, the whites of his eyes exposed, unfamiliar to the feeling of helplessness. It\u2019d been a while since he felt that. Father Sun, it felt good. A new experience. The preciousness of mortality. An ending to make the journey sweeter. Men spend their lives avoiding death. Amir\u2019sshan, the man-god, chieftain of chieftains welcomed it with open arms. Finally, restfulness could greet him. Finally, an end to everlong suffering.\n\nRel\u2019sumbra cut Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s throat.

His body could be destroyed the same as any, despite its youthful and inability to age. One moment the end was inevitable, peace was coming for Amir\u2019sshan. The next, imprisonment. An endless sea of blackness to dwell within. No colors, no life. Just blackness without a comforting purple shade.\n\nFoolish Rel\u2019sumbra!\n\nThe godkiller couldn\u2019t destroy the soul of Amir\u2019sshan. Years spent compiling enough ore to craft the weapon; many men paid their lives to forge the dagger. And yet Amir\u2019sshan still lived. Curse the day! Death would not bring mercy to the former chieftain. The peace he sought escaped him, perhaps would always escape him. Ha-ha-ha\u2026 Trapped in a darkened world with only his thoughts as company, as much a depiction of hell as there\u2019s ever been. He would have gladly chosen the lake of fire, the eternal bodily suffering. For this kind of purgatory is the worst kind: the constant exposure of one\u2019s mind without escape. It\u2019s Amir\u2019sshan and the void. Amir\u2019sshan and the void. Amir\u2019sshan and the void. Amir\u2019sshan\u2026\n\nFather.\n\nSilence.\n\nFather, can you hear me?\n\nSilence.\n\nIf he still possessed a body, a grin would have appeared at the corner of his lips. If he still possessed a body, his stomach would hurt from laughter. If he still possessed a body, he would drink himself into oblivion. Ha-ha\u2026 Seemed he already found himself there without wine. Everlong darkness. Not the kind the eyes ever adjust to. There\u2019s no shade. No contrast. He can\u2019t even call it a sea of darkness, for a sea holds waves. Structure. His entire prison might be small, it might be larger than the world itself. Color, time, size held no meaning. Simply, darkness. He might have been here decades, centuries, minutes. Nothing held meaning. Nothing mattered. There was darkness, and there was Amir\u2019sshan. Father Sun holds no dominion here. Simply, darkness.\n\nThen\n\nSuddenly\n\nAwareness.\n\nPhantoms appeared from nowhere. Gray, ghostly shapes like the weapons that Amir\u2019sshan could summon. He saw the throne room. He saw Rel\u2019sumbra standing over the fallen man-god\u2019s body, pondering what to do next. The assassin priest\u2019s entire life was centered on ending Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s life. Once he accomplished the task, what then?\n\nHe saw Rel\u2019sumbra place the chieftain\u2019s headdress upon his own head. For the first time, he saw his killer\u2019s face. Rel\u2019sumbra removed the hood that covered his face. The priest possessed angular features, the crook of his nose seemed to bring the tip of his nose below his nostrils, beak-like. His face was marked with lines of aging; the assassin looked far beyond his age. His eyes, youthful. His face, elderly--the price of dark magic, likely taking years from his life in order to feed the ancient power. By whatever means it took. If Rel\u2019sumbra only lived a year longer--and it looked like that was a stretch--to remove Amir\u2019sshan from power, then it gladly paid the cost. Commendable, really. Just as his allies had given their lives, so too, did their ringleader.\n\nAmir\u2019sshan spoke from his imprisonment\n(Bondsman.)\nand bonded with the first one to wield the artifact, for even presence with his killer was preferential to loneliness with only his mind to keep him company. And soon, he would learn to despise the bondsmen, only pairing himself with the select few over the next thousands of years. But for now, upon being cast into the void, imprisoned within the artifact, he couldn\u2019t be alone. No. Better that he had died. Better that he had been smote into non-existence. Hell was a very real place, once housed within the physical mind of Amir\u2019sshan; now it followed him beyond death, a constant predator, a stalker in the night. And it laughed in his face.\n\nLaughed.\nLAUGHED.\nLAUGHED!", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "You awaken in an unfamiliar bed. It\u2019s nothing but a small padded mat with a single blanket spread out over your body, no frame, placed directly on the floor. You\u2019re in a small room. Blank walls, no windows. A small fireplace is opposite of the mat, the wood that sits within blackened, small traces of embers underneath. Recently burned itself out, by the looks of it. That\u2019s not what draws your eyes, however. E\u2019ffy lays in front of the fireplace on her side, one arm supporting her head as a pillow. No blanket. No padding. Simply, her, the floor, and the fireplace. Not one to have poor manners, allowing a woman to take the floor while you have a \u201cbed,\u201d you try to remember the previous night\u2019s events. And suddenly it rushes in: the story of Amir\u2019sshan.\n\nThey assassinated you. Trapped you in a prison of black mithril.\n(A long time ago, yes.)\nAnd now you can enact your revenge on the cult.\n(Will you aid me in this, bondsman?)\n\nYou do not answer right away. There\u2019s more to the artifact than being a weapon of immense power. A living being, an immortal god resides within, despite centuries--perhaps millennia--of twisted thoughts taking hold. E\u2019ffy was right. And suddenly, it\u2019s all clear to you. You believe. The voice within the artifact is greater than your own. Amir\u2019sshan, the man-god, chieftain of chieftains. The two of you are bonded to one another, a mortal body and an immortal soul. Man-god. Perhaps this is the way it was always meant to be. One foot in the realm of mortality, another in the divine. It\u2019s balance. Grounding.\n\nThe S\u2019umbra will regret the day they turned on Amir\u2019sshan.\n\nAmir\u2019sshan does not answer you, but you sense the man-god\u2019s gratitude. The two of you, though bonded, have been at odds ever since the artifact landed in your possession. The combined strength, the alignment of your minds. A relentless soldier seeking rest in battle, the battered sanity of a god. Together, Terr\u2019ok and the S\u2019umbra have no chance.\n\nE\u2019ffy stirs. She sits up and looks in your direction. \u201cYou are well?\u201d\n\nYou nod. \u201cAmir\u2019sshan has spoken to me. The path is set before us. We will enter the gauntlet, and the S\u2019umbra will be no more.\u201d You roll out of the bed. \u201cDid you bring me here yourself?\n\nIt\u2019s E\u2019ffy\u2019s turn to nod. \u201cYou were deep in the vision and you needed rest for today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell...thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome. Eat. Gather your strength. The day will be long.\u201d\n\nIn time you would look back on those five words, the day will be long, and discover the truth of them. Now, however, you pay no mind to them and make your way to the storeroom for breakfast.\n\n---\n\nBelly full, and a few cups of tea down, you gather your equipment for the day. It\u2019s not not much as you travel light. Your longsword is strapped in its typical spot, running from right shoulder to left hip. It doesn\u2019t get as much use nowadays, one of the side-effects of possessing a black mithril dagger with a god\u2019s soul trapped within. Still, you\u2019ve kept it all this time. Dependable. Trustworthy. It\u2019s not an extravagant weapon by any means, but it\u2019s exactly how a sword should be. Finely crafted and doesn\u2019t dull easily. If something were to happen to Amir\u2019sshan--and you\u2019re not the kind to rely on magical artifacts--you\u2019ll be glad to have the traditional weapon, as handy as any dagger hidden in a boot.\n\nYou\u2019ve abandoned the crimson tunic of Magda, and you\u2019re glad for it. The shirt made you an outsider to both the Blackbirds and yourself. Not that representing your birth country is confusing to your identity; it just brings a certain uneasiness that you\u2019d rather not weigh you down, especially not now. Bastus, Lionel, and the rest of the company probably still consider you to be traitors to the High King. With the Alteran occupation of the Magda garrison, you\u2019re sure your traitorous position is set in stone, along with the number of gold pieces for your head. Luckily, bounty hunters aren\u2019t running rampant in the New World as they are in the Old. That\u2019ll change in time, you\u2019re sure.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ve been given a shirt woven in black thread, its shade close to raven (although not quite). It\u2019s one of Onng\u2019s. Any other and it\u2019d extend down to your knees. You strap your leather armor over the top; you\u2019re not as quick to toss the armor away even if it were given by a Magda quartermaster. On your thigh, where the Alteran flintlock used to rest, is where you leave Amir\u2019sshan. The edge of the winged-tip grip sticks out of the leather holster, begging to be drawn, silently of course, although that can change in an instant.\n\nBelly full, and a few cups of tea down, you exit the temple.\n\n---\n\nE\u2019ffy leads you through the war camp. She strides confidently ahead with Onng taking up the rear. It\u2019s the silently agreed upon order of walking as it's a risk to have you or Redding on either edge. The Blackbirds seem to keep to their customs well enough, not a lawless people in the least, but there still could be a disgruntled warrior or two mourning from their defeat at the Magda garrison. Having two outsiders in their war camp offers the opportunity for retaliation, and you can\u2019t think of a worse ending to things than suffering a mob attack. So you play the part of respectful guest, allowing E\u2019ffy to escort you to your destination: Chieftain Malic\u2019ant, her father.\n\nEverywhere you go, eyes follow. It\u2019s not everyday the war camp receives visitors. You\u2019re surprised by the amount of non-military activity happening. In the Old World, soldiers are full-time. Sure, there are other tasks to do besides battlefield training, but those are focused on military maintenance, keeping equipment clean, always ensuring the High King\u2019s army is in tip-top shape. Here, the warriors are a mix of civilian and soldier, like a militia--almost--but without the casual approach to battle. They are fighters to the core, but they are also farmers, tradesmen, and family men. Not only do you receive their distrustful gaze from a warrior\u2019s perspective, you also receive it from a protective father\u2019s eyes, which is, perhaps, simply a warm-up for what awaits you at your destination. You\u2019re about to meet E\u2019ffy\u2019s father, a chieftain, who will no doubt be skeptical of the \u201coutsider\u201d company that his daughter is keeping.\n\nLike the other buildings of the war camp, the chieftain\u2019s structure is built in a circle of stone. Malic\u2019ant\u2019s hall is larger than the others. Larger, even, than E\u2019ffy\u2019s temple. It\u2019s reached by a long stretch of road, ravenlight evenly spread out on either side. Blackbird warriors, their face painted in ash, stand guard outside, casually leaning on spears. Unlike the previous warriors you passed, these appear to be full-time; their job is to keep their chieftain from danger. Despite the apparent friendliness with the chieftain\u2019s daughter, or perhaps because of that, they eye you with a disapproving gaze, more than ready and willing to jump to her defense should the tek\u2019usan get out of line.\n\nThrough the outer line of defense you go into the main gates of Malic\u2019ant\u2019s hall. The inside is an open room, built around a single focus: a training pit. It\u2019s made from dirt. Torches, real torches, line the perimeter, sending shadows to spar in the center. Behind the pit sits a throne. It\u2019s constructed of animal bone, white jagged points jut out the way a thorn protects its ros. Resting on top is Chieftain Malic\u2019ant. The first thing you think is--\n\n(Old.)\nI was about to say that.\n(Not out loud, I hope.)\n\nMalic\u2019ant had certainly seen better days. To say the Blackbird\u2019s skin is covered in wrinkles would be understating it. It\u2019s more like his wrinkles have skin. Long, thin white hairs hang from a ring around his head, the top itself bare. Blackbirds on average stand a full head taller than an Alteran. Besides the two that escorted Terr\u2019ok earlier, who likely stood two heads taller, Malic\u2019ant, if he could stand and straighten his back, would be at least that. Perhaps more. Now, however, he sits with a rounded back, one hand resting on a knee for support, the other holding a feathered spear, which has likely turned into more of a walking stick in recent years.\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy. Daughter,\u201d he rumbles across the hall. His body may be failing him, but you see the life in the chieftain\u2019s eyes, an untamed fire threatening to scorch all that stands in his way. \u201cWho are these outsiders?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are our freedom,\u201d E\u2019ffy answers, stopping squarely in the center of the training pit. You and the others stop as well.\n\n\u201cAre they now. And I didn\u2019t realize I was in chains,\u201d the chieftain dryly says. His voice is the warning of lightning, the sudden appearance of storm clouds. He is his daughter\u2019s father. Somehow you know the mother is out of the picture.\n\n\u201cThat is the problem, is it not? The S\u2019umbra--\u201d\n\n\u201cI KNOW WHY YOU\u2019RE HERE, GIRL.\u201d Malic\u2019ant\u2019s voice booms in the hall; it\u2019s a gunshot in the night, the dagger finding a weak place in a set of armor. The chieftain quiets down. \u201cI know why you are here. And you dishonor yourself by not holding custom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are outsiders and do not hold the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are under your wing and will follow our ways.\u201d\n\nSomehow, and this intuition comes easier than the one about E\u2019ffy\u2019s mother, you imagine this type of exchange happens often between the two, perhaps in cause of E\u2019ffy\u2019s mother. The priestess turns to you. She quickly whispers to fill you in.\n\n\u201cI am sorry for this. Defend yourself.\u201d\n\nThe words themselves don\u2019t fill you in as much as the sweep that accompanies it. Her arms push you off balance, while her foot blocks you from taking a step back to keep your feet underneath your body. Instinct takes over, and as you\u2019re falling over backward, you clutch on to E\u2019ffy\u2019s arm, dragging her down with you. WIth your legs wrapped around her torso to hold her into place, your arms work to isolate a limb for submission, both hands locked around a single of E\u2019ffy\u2019s wrist. And that\u2019s when you learn that striking is allowed. E\u2019ffys free arm blasts a fist into your face. Your vision sparks for a second, just enough time for you to see a second incoming punch.\n\nYou shift your weight in order to dodge the second punch, giving E\u2019ffy the opportunity to twist from your grasp, even if the punch itself doesn\u2019t land. The both of you find yourselves standing, facing against one another in the ring. In the corner of your eye, you see Redding and Onng have quietly excused themselves outside of the ring. Good. This is just between you and E\u2019ffy. Chieftain Malic\u2019ant watches intently, no doubt a legendary warrior in his time, his rule built from spoils of war. One must prove themselves worthy in order to receive an audience.\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy,\u201d you whisper. \u201cWho\u2019s supposed to win this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one who is stronger,\u201d she answers back, rather unhelpfully.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the offensive", "result": "She said it herself, the stronger one is meant to achieve victory here. Being the daughter of Malic\u2019ant, you\u2019re certain that E\u2019ffy had significant training, perhaps even beyond your own. But training decays over time, a sword rusted and brittle from lack of use. Better to possess a sword of well-maintained quality rather than an initially well-crafted one, poorly handled. You shake the analogies from your mind as you take the offensive. Better is the quick cut of a surgeon, an emotionally-surgical sever than the unsure hands of a novice afraid to make a mistake. Another analogy slipped through. You make it the last, feeling the ever-familiar flow state take hold.\n\nIt\u2019s not limited to the battlefield and forged weapons. It arrives during any fit of combat, hand-to-hand included. You may seek to end the show early, but you\u2019d prefer to avoid knocking E\u2019ffy out senseless. As soon as the thought appears, you almost turn back on it--a cross, designed to knock you out senseless barely misses, fired from the chieftain\u2019s daughter. She\u2019s quick, dangerously so, always sliding just out of reach, closing in before your defenses can fully manifest itself.\n\nAnd you realize she has to be. The woman herself can\u2019t outmuscle you; the strength discrepancy must be even greater between her and a Blackbird, standing a full head taller than you. E\u2019ffy fights like a floating butterfly, a hornet from a disturbed nest. You, on the other hand, stick to your training. Countless hours of drilling instilled within, emerging whenever the flow calls upon. E\u2019ffy dances about. You cut her off. She presses. You give ground. She feints. You don\u2019t bite.\n\nYou act like you\u2019re moving left but then quickly switchstep to catch E\u2019ffy unaware. Both arms find an entry, hands locking behind the woman\u2019s torso. She\u2019ll not break from your grasp easily. Her style only works if she never finds herself caught, pinned down, which is exactly where you take her. You use your superior strength to wrestle E\u2019ffy to the ground, hand still clasped holding the priestess in place.\n\n\u201cThere is only one way this ends,\u201d she whispers, too soft for anyone else to hear. \u201cNo mercy. Give no ground. Show strength.\u201d\n\n(Knock her out.)\n\nShe\u2019s at your mercy, held down by your grip. Knock her out? The sparring matches of Alteran end here, with one member subdued by the other. Knock her out? It\u2019s dirty. Unsportsmanlike. The goal of sparring is to improve one another\u2019s skills, not seeking to harm the other by any means, besides harm that naturally occurs in training, that is. Furthermore, and not that you\u2019ve been the most chivalrous of men, but there\u2019s the fact that E\u2019ffy is a woman, a beautiful one at that. Something about knocking her senseless just doesn\u2019t feel...right. You sense the eyes of Malic\u2019ant, her father, watching your next move. It\u2019s time to pass judgement.", "action_results": [{"action": "Knock her out", "result": "Despite your feelings, you know what must be done. The Blackbirds are a people that rely on the strong. Not only the physically strong, but those with the warrior spirit as well, those who would accomplish their task by any means necessary. For the good of the tribe, even if it\u2019s at a personal loss. There is only way this ends, a warrior\u2019s defeat and victory to offer to the chieftain, a symbol of the uncertainty of war. Loss and gain come hand in hand. Not one without the other. Chieftain Malic\u2019ant is as tested as they come; and by similarity, the grit to do what must be done, as an offering, is the greatest gift you could bestow upon the chieftain. Pearls, gems, and heirlooms be damned.\n\nOne hand curls into a tight fist, the other holds E\u2019ffy\u2019s face into position, like readying the sacrificial animal for an altar. She looks up to you and nods her agreement. Your mind whispers an apology, desperately hoping she receives the message, as your hand lifts for the finishing blow. (It must be done.) Pain erupts through your knuckles, insignificant. E\u2019ffy\u2019s head snaps back. Her body crumples to the ground--or it would--but you catch her limp body and gently guide her to a comfortable prone position.\n\n\u201cStep forward, outsider,\u201d Chieftain Malic\u2019ant orders. You comply.\n\nAs you reach the end of the sparring pit, movement flashes behind you. Redding and Onng rush to take care of E\u2019ffy. Nothing permanent is likely to affect her. However, she suffered trauma to the head--and with such a blow, treatment is better sooner than later. You\u2019ve witnessed, personally, the effects of such trauma: slurred words, reduced cognitive ability. Causing such an impairment to the priestesses, by an undeserved blow in most opinion, would be an unforgivable act in your mind. You reach the edge of the pit. Hard packed sand gives way to stone. The floor is natural cavern rock, scrapped to be smooth, although it\u2019s not perfect. You can view more than a few ridges and bumps in the ground, nothing too extensive, although it\u2019d be considered a mortal sin to designers in Alteran.\n\n\u201cCloser. I\u2019ll not bite.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure of the truthfulness in the chieftain\u2019s words. Or it could be one of those technicalities. I\u2019ll not bite, but you didn\u2019t say anything about stabbing you with my spear! Technically correct, still the undesired outcome. You\u2019re allowed to walk right up to the chieftain. The two large Blackbird guards stand at attention, ready to act in a moment\u2019s notice should you act less-than-savory. Under a throne of white animal bone, tusked skulls lining the top, Malic\u2019ant addresses you.\n\n\u201cYou are made of sturdier stuff than your countrymen. Tell me, how do you fare against them?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgainst my fellow soldiers?\u201d you ask, quickly answering your own question. \u201cI win more than I lose. The same can be said for the battlefield against other armies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d the chieftain ponders aloud. The sound of his thinking is like the low rumble of an aftershock earthquake, the steady pour of rain clouds lingering after a storm. \u201cYou are not the greatest warrior.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n\u201cNor the quickest.\u201d\n\nAnother shake of the head. \u201cOr the smartest.\u201d\n\n(Some points are proven in the words themselves.)\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Malic\u2019ant\u2019s grip tightens around the spear. The speartip protrudes from a shaft of many feathers, from underneath a makeshift wing, if you will. \u201cNot the strongest or the quickest or the smartest. Tell me, outsider, what do you offer then?\u201d\n\n(Time to dance. What shall I be? Six-shooter, sword?)\nNothing.\n(What, you think you have something to offer besides me?)\nYou picked me despite a lack of magical artifact. Are you telling me you didn\u2019t see anything?\n(They call me the mad-god for a reason.)\nYou hate that name.\n(I do.)\nMalic\u2019ant respects the strength of the individual.\n(And you defeated a woman in battle. You possess strength, indeed.)\nNo easy foe. Likely trained by the chieftain himself.\n(That\u2019s not enough to impress the man though.)\nI know, I know. Thinking.\n(Think quicker. We\u2019ve been--)\n\n\u201cSilence caught your tongue?\u201d Malic\u2019ant breaks the inner dialogue with Amir\u2019sshan. Your companions are used to the gap in responses when Amir\u2019shan speaks. Others aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cApologies, Chieftain,\u201d you respectfully answer. \u201cAmir\u2019sshan speaks to me in moments such as this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true then. You are the bondsman. You possess a weapon greater than any of the Harri\u2019ar. That is your offering, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Chieftain,\u201d you respond back. \u201cThe weapon is merely a tool. (Hey, now...) I would not offer something that another can merely take from my grasp. That is the same as equating my strength to the armor strapped around my body or the warriors that I call an ally.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d the chieftain says, interest in his voice.\n\n\u201cI am not the strongest, physically. Nor do I possess the mind to outthink my opponents at every turn. Yet Amir\u2019sshan chose me for the bond; the man-god saw an unrelenting spirit, one that never strays from the path. I\u2019m an arrow, Chieftain, set upon its course, fired true. There\u2019s no going back once the bowstring is released. I\u2019ll not hit my target unless plucked from the sky itself. And in order to do so, those must answer to Amir\u2019sshan. I will do what is necessary to achieve victory, even if that means striking my own...ally,\u201d you call E\u2019ffy that for lack of a better term.\n\nChieftain Malic\u2019ant doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, he rises from his skeletal throne, both hands leaning on the spear for support. The guards behind him don\u2019t flinch, but you can tell they\u2019re ready to rush to their chieftain\u2019s aid should his decrypted bones fail him. Interesting, isn\u2019t it? He rests on a throne built from others\u2019 bones, yet his own seek to betray him. Such is the course for all, however, and not all conquer the amount Malic\u2019ant has during their time.\n\nEven with an arched back the chieftain towers above you. A weathered face examines yours, wisdom in Malic\u2019ants eyes, the kind that is born from experience, the kind that outvalues all others. \u201cAsk something of me and I will grant it. I give you my word as chieftain.\u201d\n\nIt strikes you that you could ask for anything, wealth, comforts, the hand of his daughter in union. All far short to the mission; they\u2019re but minor distractions pulling you from greatness. There\u2019s a task to accomplish, first starting with the native people of the New World then moving to the Old. With your answer, you seal in every unanswered question of doubt, smiting away all that takes you from the path. \u201cWe are challenging Terr\u2019ok and the S\u2019umbra by the trial of the old ways, to run the gauntlet of the gods and challenge the S\u2019umbra\u2019s champion. We need your support.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you shall have it,\u201d Malic\u2019ant affirms, slamming the butt of his spear into the stone floor for emphasis. \u201cYou shall have it.\u201d\n\nWith Malic'ant\u2019s support, you gained the right to challenge Terr\u2019ok by the old ways. Yet you need more. The chieftain brought support from the tribe; the gauntlet will bring support from the gods. For a people so obviously devoted to the Raven, you\u2019re a bit surprised to hear of other gods existing. Amir\u2019sshan only made sense because of his alternate reference, the Raven incarnate. According to E\u2019ffy, there are many in the Harri\u2019ar\u2019s religion. The Raven is above all, but another, subtier of gods exist, including figures that turned Alteran tavern rumors and borderline stereotypes into reality, gods such as the sun, earth, etc.\n\nThe chieftain dispatched one of his warriors to call a meeting of the tribe\u2019s leaders, which consisted itself of chieftains puppeteering under the S\u2019umbra and Malic\u2019ant. No one challenged Mali\u2019cant\u2019s backing. They didn\u2019t lend additional support, however, but no one openly disagreed with the legendary warrior. Respect, honor: it lasts far longer than the brittle bones of man. The Harri\u2019ar are not a people bound by the sundial. They live lives free from the constraints of mankind\u2019s contribution to tracking time. They call the trial to happen that very day. If, indeed, the Harri\u2019ar are being led by the wrong leader, then change needs to happen immediately; the gauntlet will determine if that\u2019s the case.\n\nYour body timer, speaking of time, tells you it\u2019s just past midday, despite the lack of natural sunlight in the war camp. As the one who made an audience with Malic\u2019ant, and the bondsman of Amir\u2019sshan, you\u2019ll be the one running the gauntlet. No surprise there. They painted your face in ash and stripped you of all armor, minus something called an a\u2019lta, a blanket-like garment wrapped around your waist. On your head, a headdress of feathers was placed, only all the feathers have been plucked. The result is a headdress of spikes, white thorny stems that usually hid underneath the comfort of its feathers. You are allowed to keep your weapons, though, which includes Amir\u2019sshan. Shirtless, face marked with ash, they set you upon the path, into the mouth of the cave: the gauntlet of the gods.", "action_results": [{"action": "The gauntlet of the gods", "result": "Darkness. Darkness abounds. Never has the light abandoned you as this. Not even on the blackest nights, during the nightmares brought on by childhood, or even worse, those occurring as a man. The mouth of the tunnel leads you down a narrow path, no signs of alternate routes or branches exist here. You walk forward, hands stretched out in front, feeling the stone walls as you continue into the darkness. It\u2019s cool, the kind of temperature that greets you in the morning, a sign, perhaps, that the trial is only just beginning.\n\nThe journey takes you around several twists and bends before you arrive at a clearing. Small gemstones saturate the rocks here, a full nightsky in each stone, sending the entire clearing into a lunar glow, although the darkness still sends the ceiling into an endless black. You stride forward, aware of the crunching of rocks underneath your boots, the sound of every breath. It\u2019s dead quiet in the gauntlet; every movement from your body brings defilement.\n\nLike all the Harri\u2019ar architecture you\u2019ve seen, the room seems to focus on a single point, centered around an object at the center. In this case, it\u2019s a sarcophagus. It\u2019s built like...\n\n...you\u2019ve seen it before. It\u2019s a replica of the one in the halls of the dead, the place where you and Redding first discovered the artifact. If the scene will play out similarly, then--\n\n--Stone shatters. Rocks separate, lighting bolt cracks running through their bodies. The lid of the sarcophagus follows suit, a large crack twisting down the center like a painted river on a map. In a shower of rock, a hand reaches out from within the sarcophagus. Not a second later, the other grabs a handful of air as it, too, breaks out. The arms themselves possess a layer of decaying skin, gaps showing all the way to the bone. Another shower of rock. Feet, skin hanging to the bone like a poorly-stitched tunic. A mouth without a jaw. Empty gaps where eyes should reside, the same for its nose.\n\nThe creature rises to meet you, not a lich. Not an undead priest. But, Redding.\n\nHiyya, kid.\n\nHis voice appears both in your mind and through your ears, audibly. It\u2019s different, though. And not due to its medium, although that\u2019s another point to quickly address. It reminds you of your childhood, the way a classroom friend would speak to you. A certain innocence, or perceived innocence accompanies it. Here\u2019s a man speaking like he knows every goddamn truth to grace mankind. Whether childlike ignorance or a good cardplayer, you\u2019re sure to find out the answer soon, the undead Redding patiently awaits your reply.\n\nTake your time; I've only got...eternity! Ha ha!\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t him,\u201d you flatly state.\n\nAm I not? This is how you view me.\n\nYou bite down on your tongue. Answering \u201cRedding\u201d would give credibility to his statement. Instead, you scan the area for a path forward. None exist, or at least none that are visible. The cavern walls hide in the shadows; they could be either a foot or a hundred paces and you wouldn\u2019t know for certain.\n\nWant to see my bunkmate?\n\nBefore you can answer, another pair of arms reaches from within the sarcophagus. It must be deeply built, if two bodies can fit within, assuming it\u2019s actually there. Hands grab for the outer edges of the sarcophagus like the way one would rise from a bathtub, skin hanging loosely from bone. The new figure rises, and you can see a long ring of black hair around its skull. Dead, decaying, there\u2019s no mistaking the second undead man. It\u2019s like looking into a mirror, minus the obvious difference in health. It\u2019s you.\n\nThe artifact. All that matters is the artifact.\nYou would abandon your allies for it.\nAbandon. Betray.\nWhatever it takes.\n\n\u201cYou\u201d dialogue with Redding, and it strikes you that the exchange sounds very similar to the way you and Amir\u2019sshan speak. That\u2019s where the thought ends, however. Whatever meaning you\u2019re meant to discern from the symbolism is lost on you. The undead version of yourself now addresses you.\n\nYou betrayed your family.\n\n\u201cThe company is fine,\u201d you answer, this time, thinking of Bastus and Lionel. \u201cThey were rescued by the battalion\u2019s takeover.\u201d\n\nYou betray them even now, not even acknowledging their presence.\n\nOh. So it meant your real family: A father too concerned with his work for your well-being, an overbearing mother, an older sister with achievements far beyond your own. Hell, Vladimir felt like more of a family figure than those who share your blood. Your name presented too much renown in Magda to escape to the military there. Even operation under a false name would eventually be discovered. Magda may be a large territory, but its social ladder makes it operate like one much smaller, everyone of reputable position knowing the dealings of other families. In Magda, both enemies and allies alike are invited to dinner, just remain vigilant of missing table knives.\n\n\u201cIf my actions are considered a betrayal, then it\u2019s only justified. I didn\u2019t start...whatever disagreements we had, but I certainly wasn\u2019t going to hang around as the family scapegoat.\u201d\n\nYou left your father with no heir.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine in that regard. My sister would lead the house better than I ever could, and I mean that. They\u2019re better off with me gone.\u201d\n\nYour house is no more. Dissolved. Consumed by a rival house. Vladimir was assassinated in the streets. Your sister was forced to marry into the rival\u2019s bloodline, a former classmate of yours. Do you remember a boy named Kelle?\n\nRemember him, the boy stands at the very center of a memory long forgotten, suppressed over the years and medicated with drink and other...distractions, a story that is the nightmare of every adolescent. That is not this story, however, and you are no longer an adolescent. So your father\u2019s house fell apart in your absence. Perhaps it was always destined to set upon that course. Who knows. There\u2019s no determining for sure, although the loss of Vladimir might have been the beginning of the end. Your father\u2019s man performed every task for his master, including serving as a sliver of what a father figure might be.\n\n\u201cTheir fate is their own,\u201d you find yourself saying. \u201cAs well as mine is my own.\u201d\n\nFlesh and blood is a lifelong bond.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a strong bond, but it\u2019s not lifelong,\u201d you answer. Your hand subconsciously travels to Amir\u2019sshan. \u201cI know what a true bond is, felt.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s taking him over already.\nI see it happening too.\nThe allure of power, blinding.\nHe cannot see what\u2019s occurring before his eyes.\n\n\u201cQuit the riddles. Speak plainly,\u201d you address the undead.\n\nPlainly, then, the undead version of you speaks.\nYou\u2019re the boss, undead Redding adds on.\nAmir\u2019sshan will consume you.\nA mortal body he desires.\nThe mad god feigns as an ally.\nBut he seeks to trap another within the dagger.\n\n\u201cYou lie. You attempt to break me from my bond when I need it most. You work with the S\u2019umbra and seek to remove our greatest weapon before the challenge.\u201d\n\nCome on.\nIt\u2019s just us three.\nAmir\u2019sshan holds no place here.\nIt\u2019s your one safe place from the mad god.\nStay awhile.\nStay with us.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay", "result": "\u201cI...I will stay with you,\u201d you say, the words barely pouring from your mouth.\n\nExceeelent.\nYou\u2019ll find that it\u2019s rather peaceful here.\n\nAnd suddenly you find that a great weight has been lifted from your body. The burden of the task is a heavy load to bear. True, you aren\u2019t--weren\u2019t--carrying it alone with allies such as Redding and E\u2019ffy, but the main weight still lies on your shoulders, and they\u2019re in a constant state of stress because of it. For the first time in your life, at least since you can remember, you surrender. Give up. Part of you could blame it on not knowing. Rare is the decision that you know the outcome. If you\u2019re being honest with yourself, you knew what this choice would bring: a sudden end to your journey.\n\nYour mind draws to the people you\u2019ll never see again. E\u2019ffy, Redding, of course, but there are smaller players in the grand story of your life that appear now, oddly enough. Your favorite barkeep, soldiers that you\u2019ve trained with--hell, even the sailors that were aboard the Devestator on your voyage to the New World. Strange what appears to the mind when faced with finality. And that\u2019s what faces you now, the end.\n\n(So close, and yet so far. Another bondsman who failed to complete his duty.)\nThere will be another. There is no shortage of those who desire your power.\n(And you\u2019re fine with that?)\nWhatever I feel won\u2019t matter in a manner of seconds.\n(Spoken like a true mortal. Eternity is but a romantic notion. You know nothing of the torment of time...)\n\n(...But you soon will.)\n\nThe undead version of yourself closes in, Redding close behind. You see them. You could attempt to stop them. But you\u2019ve made your choice, and there\u2019s no going back now. Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s final warning rings in your mind. You soon will. The void closes in. You surrender to it. Your journey may be ending prematurely, but finally, the restlessness is gone. It\u2019s not the end you imagined, but damn if you\u2019re not relieved that it\u2019s here. Whether right or wrong, you\u2019ll have time to reflect. The last thought on your mind is the fresh smell of morning dew, one of those lesser experiences that seems to be screaming at you now, another feeling you\u2019ll never have again. Darkness closes in. Finally, you can rest.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Refuse", "result": "\u201cThat is not happening,\u201d you answer. \u201cI\u2019d rather stick around with two Magda soldiers than with you two. Now, I\u2019m moving on, and you can either watch me go or you can take it up with Amir\u2019sshan.\u201d You pat the artifact again, feeling the buzz of power that emanates within. They lied. As bondsman, you feel the artifact\u2019s energy. Amir\u2019sshan might not have spoken during the exchange, but he was present. You\u2019re sure of it. They sought to weaken your bond; instead, they\u2019ve strengthened it beyond all fraying.\n\nAs you wish.\nWe warned you.\n\nWith that, the two undead men before you twist in motion. Bones snap, loose skin falls to the ground at their bony toes. Redding starts to cackle a witch-like laughter, the kind that supposes meaning in the taunt. The sarcophagus draws to them. It pulls the undead creatures like a riverbed around a large stone. An unseen power takes them back, two pairs of feet sliding backward on the cavern floor. In another explosion of stone, the undead are shoved back into the sarcophagus, a marred lid the only evidence of the tomb\u2019s brief escapees. You\u2019re back alone in the gauntlet. Then, a light appears. It starts soft, a low glow in the distance. Like the first signs of the morning sunrise, it creeps forward tentatively, an orange-red hue. You decide to meet it. You walk forward, leaving behind the sarcophagus. At least there are no ladders this time around.\n\nThe world around you vanishes from sight. Darkness settles in for a moment as if pondering amongst itself. Then, the light returns. Red-orange framed by shifting shadows. A throne appears at the center of the light, like in the spotlight of a play. Instantly, you know it is Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s, his place of rule of Harri\u2019katan. And if there\u2019s something you\u2019ve learned about the man-god, he has a taste for the theatrical. You sense a presence. It\u2019s the feeling like you\u2019re being watched, an unknown, unguided intuition that you\u2019re not alone.\n\n\u201cCome forward,\u201d you speak into the darkness.\n\nAre you prepared?\n\nYour hand instinctively reaches for the artifact. As you draw it, you affirm your position. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\nA spirit reveals itself from behind the throne. Like with the throne, you can only think one name: Amir\u2019sshan. He towers above you, near the same height as Chieftain Malic\u2019ant back in his day. Like you, he wears an a\u2019lta and a headdress, only his is extravagantly embroidered, full of feathers without a single marred or plucked from its stem. It\u2019s in that moment that you\u2019re aware of your faults, your own shortcomings. You\u2019ve never considered yourself short, unsmuscular, or unattractive, and suddenly, you\u2019re all those things in comparison. When Amir\u2019sshan speaks again, you tack on unintelligent to the list, sure that there will be more to add momentarily.\n\nBondsman. It is a rare thing for us to meet face to face. Well, in your case, face to chest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re--taller than expected,\u201d is what you manage to say.\n\nThe spirit laughs. Yes, yes. Tall for someone trapped for centuries in a black mithril dagger. Feels good to finally stretch my legs a bit. Had a nasty kink in my back.\n\n\u201cHow are you allowed to escape?\u201d you ask. \u201cAnd why not do it sooner?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the \u2018gauntlet of the gods,\u2019 is it not? You may not know this, but they call me the man-god.\n\n\u201cOf course I know that,\u201d you snap back. If you thought dealing with the voice was frustrating, dealing with the man(god) behind it is even worse. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n\nCareful, bondsman. One cannot simply assume another knows what they mean...but in this case, I do. The prison is deteriorating.\n\nBreaking.\n\nBehold.\n\nYour hand, still touching the artifact, jumps back instinctively. The artifact moves on its own, a low rumble grows from within. You draw it for a closer examination, and as soon as you do, a black puff of smoke appears. It\u2019s the last exhaust of a dying man, a mere shadow of the powerful thunderclouds that accompany a shape shift. Then it crumbles in your hand. Its wing-tipped grip fades to dust, a black sand that escapes your hands, flowing down the sides of your palms and in between your fingers. A gust of wind catches it on the way to the cavern floor, a chilly gale that loses the artifact forever.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll be free. No longer imprisoned.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll be lost to eternity, my soul swept away like dust of the earth. I have no body to contain my soul; the godkiller took the form of a placeholder, so to speak, without the ability to move of my own accord, but alive. Very much alive. And I intend to keep it that way until the S\u2019umbra are dealt with.\n\n\u201cWhy do I sense there\u2019s a but coming?\u201d\n\nAhh. Not a bad sense for the harem, but, perhaps not what you desire now. That\u2019s because there is one, bondsman.\n\nYou\u2019re careful not to think the phrase \u201cmad-god.\u201d Amir\u2019sshan can likely read your thoughts just as the artifact did. Since you\u2019re faced with his spirit--and somehow you imagine your longsword won\u2019t be effective--you\u2019d rather not start anything that could lead to a confrontation. You\u2019re confident in your skills as a soldier; however, this is unlike any battlefield you\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nThe walls are coming down. Their container of my soul is burnt through. But there is a way to preserve my power. You.\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\nYour body is a suitable vessel. The bond is growing deep. The others could not have held my power without destroying their soul in the process. You are different. The bond unites us in body and spirit. The \u2018artifact,\u2019 as you say, is crumbling. The only way for Amir\u2019sshan to survive is if we connect, body and spirit.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn for the but. \u201cBut what will happen to me?\u201d\n\nTypical Old World mindset, always thinking about themselves...I jest. You\u2019ll still be...around. More of a passenger on a boat rather than the one who steers the ship.\n\n\u201cYou address the topic easily for one who\u2019s discussing the takeover of one\u2019s body,\u201d you comment. \u201cAre you certain you\u2019ve never gotten this far before, just with those unwilling to depart from their shell.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t play the jealous farmgirl, asking if your lover\u2019s laid with another.\n\n\u201cYour answer\u2019s yes, then. In my experience, that sort of response is telling in itself.\u201d\n\nThink yourself sly, do you? I\u2019ve been around long enough to know someone\u2019s preference to--oh what\u2019s the Old World phrase? \u2018Play second fiddle?\u2019 You may be in possession of your vessel, but you\u2019re anything but the steerer of the ship.\n\nAmir\u2019sshan\u2019s articulate speech feels like it\u2019s slipping. Often the different (mad) style of speaking is lighthearted for the most part, the result of being hundreds, thousands of years old relating to modern times. There\u2019s more than a few generation gaps in place. It\u2019s been direct, downright odd during moments, but never aggressive like this. True, there may have been an outburst or two; never so obviously towards you, however.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d you answer, feeling your face becoming hot. When faced with confrontation, you\u2019ve never been one to shy away. \u201cI\u2019m here alone, aren\u2019t I? Running through the trial all by myself, no one else to \u2018steer my ship.\u2019 I stand on my own two feet, whether that ends in victory or death, at least I know that I\u2019ve chosen to make my stand. And you cannot take that away from me.\u201d\n\nThe pup bears fangs after all. Interesting. You are in no more control of your life than I am of the High King\u2019s. Yes, I know who he is. You are here because I\u2019ve guided you here. You stand alone? False. I stand by you, lead you, as I have no doubt that your companions would try to convince you otherwise, perhaps minus the priestess. She\u2019s a looker, isn\u2019t she? No doubt will want to lay with Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s vessel. Isn\u2019t that what you want?\n\nIgnoring the obvious prodding, you reaffirm your stance. \u201cMy decisions are my own, as E\u2019ffy\u2019s are her own. You have not brought me here any more than I worship the Raven.\u201d\n\nAhh, blasphemy in the face of the gods. Truly, you are special. It\u2019s fun to poke a resting bear until it wakes. Behold!\n\nThe cavern ceiling illuminates above, showering the two of you in a cosmic glow. Stars twinkle into existence, small grains of sand with the heavens as their backdrop. Above, the nightsky appears projected on the dome-shaped ceiling, constellations displayed exactly as a winter night in Alteran. You see the Warrior, his arms extending into \u201cswords,\u201d two streaks of stars forming themselves into straight lines. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re a god yourself, an equal to those Alterans pray to at night, the heavens standing before you, not as a faraway, untouchable thing, but with the closeness of a friend, a welcoming and comforting presence.\n\nYou are but a passenger on the ship. Who brought you to the New World? Who led you to the artifact? Who brought you to the Harri\u2019ar war camp? Who put you on the trial?\n\nThe frightening part about Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s words, besides the truth that accompanies it, is that you hadn\u2019t shared those things with the voice. You never discussed details of your past. The fact that he knows is concerning; no memory, no thought is safe in Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s presence. Such is the bond between the man-god and his bondsman.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve ever had companions. That does not mean they swayed my actions. It just means I\u2019ve had the support of others.\u201d\n\nSupport? Bah! A true warrior stands on his own. His strength lies in his own sword arm. All others will fail you. Their shields grow heavy in their arms, wilting. They cannot be trusted to cover your flank. Better to watch your own back. That\u2019s, truly, the only way to live. Stand or fall, it\u2019s by your own making.\n\n\u201cAnd how did that turn out for you? Strong words for a soul who needs help now. Dare I allow you to stand on your own, then? FIne. Find another vessel to reside in. You ask for my help and then spit in my face for accepting the help of others. Good luck with your next bondsman.\u201d\n\nFool! If you will not offer it freely, then I will take the vessel myself!\n\nThe spirit of Amir\u2019sshan dives forward, both arms stretched in front of him. The feathers on his headdress trail behind him, a wing in flight. You meet the attack with equal ferocity. Your longsword rests in your hand, a foreign weapon since coming into possession of the artifact. It feels heavy in your hand, outdated. The spirit approaches, two ethereal longswords appearing, one in either hand. Amir\u2019sshan moves as if the wind, a flurry of strikes committed before you, barely, have time to muster a defense. He fights as if an angered hornet\u2019s nest, a bear who protects the well-being of her cubs. Amir\u2019sshan sweeps low, then finishes high, his blades in constant motion, the edges themselves a blur.\n\nYou do your best to maintain distance. The longsword you carry at your back is aptly named, better suited to wield with both hands due to its size, which means you can strike from a greater distance. If Amir\u2019sshan--or any opponent for that matter--is able to get in close, then you\u2019d have a difficult time, not to say the act of keeping the spirit of Amir\u2019sshan at distance is any easy task by any means. It takes great footwork and quick reflexes to keep him away, both of which you pride yourself in. Still, they call him the man-god for a reason. The spirit does not relent. It does not falter. It does not tire.\n\nBoth of Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s blades ring across your defensively-raised longsword. Three swords remain stagnant in front of you for a moment; the strength of both wielders pressed against each other. Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s face draws close to yours. His face is young, yet his eyes speak of years well-beyond his looks, a time-tested mixture of stress and wisdom displayed in them.\n\nI\u2019ve nearly forgotten the thrill of combat, the feeling of the clash of swords. Heh. And it will feel even better once in my new vessel!\n\nHe nearly overtakes you after finishing his words.\n\n\u201cThe artifact will be your grave,\u201d you answer with a grimace, the strength of the man-god increasing.\n\nSorry, old friend. Your companions will understand. The world will understand. I will not forget you. There\u2019ll be a grand feast in your honor every year. The Last Bondsman, friend of Amir\u2019sshan who sacrificed all for the man-god, the chieftain of chieftains.\n\nThe way Amir\u2019sshan switches tones, addressing you as enemy one second and friend the next is concerning. Your thoughts circle back to the mad-god. Perhaps both are equally true. All other thoughts escape you as the spirit\u2019s boot catches itself behind your heel. Just as you have time to register it, you\u2019re sent sprawling to the cavern floor, two blades following quickly behind. Your life flashes before your eyes, as cliche as the statement itself is.\n\nIt\u2019s not like the stories you\u2019ve heard: events flashing quickly together, a mash-up of important moments in your life. Rather, your mind runs in the opposite direction. The possibility. What could be. What could have been. Missed opportunities. Experiences you\u2019ll never have again. There is regret, sure, but that\u2019s not the theme of it. It\u2019s as if clarity has finally settled in for the first time, unfiltered, unmuddled by other distractions and worthless things that life brings. It\u2019s the feeling of passing into manhood and realizing the petty squabbles and desires of boyhood don\u2019t matter. They never mattered. In the moment, however...in the moment it felt like the fucking world was on a knife\u2019s edge. You feel it on a grand scale. There are things you\u2019ll never get around to. There are people you\u2019ll never express your true feelings towards. And that\u2019s fine. It has to be. It\u2019s not as if you can change it now.\n\nClarity. It speaks.\n\nYou battle, yes, but Amir\u2019sshan can\u2019t kill you. He needs your \u201cvessel.\u201d Instead of fighting back, you accept the outcome. Supine, you toss your longsword away and raise both hands in surrender. The man-god stands over you, both swordpoints at the base of your neck.\n\n\u201cGo on. Do it,\u201d you whisper.\n\nDon\u2019t tempt me, Bondsman.\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d you utter a second time. \u201cEnd me here. I\u2019ve betrayed those who\u2019ve grown close, my blood family, the Alteran company I\u2019ve spent years fighting beside. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the same thing happens to E\u2019ffy and Redding. You\u2019ll be doing the world a favor. I\u2019ll not beg. I\u2019ll not plead for mercy. You win. You\u2019ve bested me. End it here. End it now.\u201d\n\nThe spirit raises both swords overhead. Here it is; the restlessness you\u2019ve spent your life avoiding will finally be silenced. Amir\u2019sshan pauses a moment, then he stabs both blades down. As hard as you try, your eyes shut with the sudden motion. The world turns into darkness.", "action_results": [{"action": "Light appears", "result": "Your eyes open. It takes a second to register sight. Blood lines the edges of Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s ethereal swords, red drops falling from the points. It\u2019s not yours, however. You remain unscathed. Two bodies fall shortly after, Blackbirds dressed similarly in a\u2019ltas, their faces painted with ash. While your exposure to the natives has been short, the ability to distinguish between them is not lost. You recognize the pair of bodies, each carrying two axes. Terr\u2019ok\u2019s bodyguards, the sizable warriors that accompanied him to E\u2019ffy\u2019s temple.\n\nAmir\u2019sshan meets your gaze. He winks, then gestures towards your holster with his head. As you look down, you discover the artifact intact, back in the shape of a dagger at your thigh. Upon return, the spirit is gone. You\u2019re alone, save for the two dead Blackbirds lying next to you, the fabricated nightsky still shining overhead. Realizing there could be additional threat, you rise to your feet and draw the artifact. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. The six-shooter manifests in your hand. A footstep drags on the cavern floor behind you. You wheel, cocking the hammer back. Click. It echoes in the gauntlet, a warning to all who would approach.\n\nTerr\u2019ok, high priest of the S\u2019umbra, ancestor of the Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s assassins, stands before you. He carries the wooden staff with a raven carved at the top. His dark purple robe is frayed at the edges, fitting for the Blackbird. You somehow can\u2019t imagine a native of the New World wearing extravagant clothing--at least what the Alteran nobility would consider extravagant, Amir\u2019sshan excluded. Unlike when you met previously, his hood is pulled low, hiding his features behind a wall of shadow. Terr\u2019ok\u2019s voice speaks from underneath the hood, a lion purring in the jungle.\n\n\u201cMade it this far, I see. Most don\u2019t make it past the crypt of self-reflection.\u201d\n\nWhether that\u2019s the actual name for the events at the sarcophagus or strong symbolism, you know his meaning...and his intent. There\u2019s only one reason why the high priest would meet you here, intervene. The S\u2019umbra were content to sit back as you first entered the gauntlet. Although as you made progress, you imagine nervousness settled in, uneasiness. They took matters into their own hands, as blasphemous as it is. Intervening in the gauntlet of the gods.\n\nKill him. Kill him now.\n(You know, we agree for once.)\n\nYou do not answer Terr\u2019ok. You do not pause to spill words, highlighting your revenge or the journey that\u2019s reached its climax. Your mind does not run to E\u2019ffy, dedicating the shot to the priestess, a friend, perhaps even more. Strange as it sounds, your mind, instead, is filled with images of training. The first time a flintlock was introduced in your hand. How comfortable it felt, a weapon of deadly power with only two pounds of pressure needed to release. Countless hours spent at the range, honing the craft. There were plenty of misses. Many more than the number of hours you practiced. But still you kept at it. After a while, drawing the flintlock felt like lacing up your boots, buttoning your military jacket. Natural and necessary. Pulled from its holster, slamming down the hammer, firing. All in one smooth motion. You do as you\u2019ve done countless times. You do as you defeated the lich to claim the artifact. You aim. You fire.\n\nSmoke appears at your face. As it clears, you expect to see Terr\u2019ok\u2019s body blown apart. He remains standing, however, and you imagine a grin shining underneath the hood. Your bullet falls harmlessly at his feet in a sound no louder than a needle dropping, although here, in this moment, it sounds like stormy waves slamming into the side of a ship at sea.\n\n(EEEEEEEEE)\n\nAmir\u2019sshan screams in your mind. It\u2019s all you can do to hold a straight face. His sudden outburst affected you before. You\u2019ll not let it happen again.\n\n\u201cThe Veil,\u201d Terr\u2019ok explains,\u201d protects me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here I thought it was supposed to be the Raven,\u201d you retort. The mention of their god sets him off.\n\n\u201cWho do you think bestowed the power upon me,\u201d Terr\u2019ok hisses. \u201cYour accusation is full of blasphemy. The Raven helps those who helps themselves. I do not worship and expect the Raven to fulfill all for me. One must be willing to fight for their belief.\u201d\n\nYou ignore the obvious point of blasphemy as Terr\u2019ok is currently interrupting a test meant to prove the gods\u2019 favor. And you know what? Perhaps he\u2019s simply a part of it. The Blackbird people aren\u2019t ones to ignore customs; that was seen clearly with the tradition in Chieftain Malic\u2019ant\u2019s hut. Intervening on the trial meant to be judged by the gods: that\u2019s more than enough cause to remove the S\u2019umbra from power. Terr\u2019ok\u2019s done you a favor. Your enemy has come to you. In one fell swoop you can prove the Blackbird gods support you and the S\u2019umbra aren\u2019t worthy to lead. You\u2019ll need to survive the encounter, of course, and you have a strong feeling that Terr\u2019ok isn\u2019t planning to allow you to simply walk out of the gauntlet.\n\n\u201cYour people will be better off without you,\u201d you say. Amir\u2019sshan becomes a blade in your hand. You emphasize your words by pointing the sword tip at Terr\u2019ok. \u201cYou will be remembered as a group of power-hungry priests using your religion as a weapon against your own people. Parents will tell bedtime stories to their children of the evil S\u2019umbra, of Terr\u2019ok, the coward who hid behind the name of his god. They will celebrate your death. Their only mourning will be that you weren\u2019t removed from power earlier. You will be nothing but a stain on your people\u2019s history, a name accompanied with spit. Your fate runs much deeper than bodily death. I will destroy your very being.\u201d\n\nThe hood prevents you from seeing Terr\u2019ok\u2019s response, but you can tell he\u2019s seething. You imagine his teeth grinding together, eyebrows narrowed. His grip around the ravenheaded staff grows tight. White color starts to show at his knuckles, the staff itself threatening to snap in pieces.\n\n\u201cYou, my misled outsider, will pay for that.\u201d Terr\u2019ok\u2019s staff raps against the cavern floor. It echoes softly, the sound appearing all around you, diminishing in volume. Then it grows larger, louder. Another tap. It appears behind you. All around you. Tap. It\u2019s joined by others. The S\u2019umbra, more than just Terr\u2019ok. Tap. More hooded figures step out from the darkness, wearing the same dark purple robes as their high priest. Tap. They carry the same staves; their faces hide in the shroud. Only you stand, exposed to all; you and Amir\u2019sshan.\n\n(I am myself again.)\nNot entirely, but I know what you mean.\n(Kill them?)\nKill them all.\n\nSix of them stand before you. Six proud men, confident in their abilities, never tasting the bitterness of defeat. Soon. It\u2019s a flavor that\u2019ll soon overwhelm their senses. Curious, the thunderclouds appear. Black smoke subsides in Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s shape shifting. The six-shooter, fitting name for the circumstance, lies in your palm. Terr\u2019ok may be protected by the Veil, but, perhaps, the others aren\u2019t. There\u2019s only one way to find out. You attempt to fire at all the newcomers. Your hand slams against the hammer, hard enough to bruise, firing the weapon directly from the hip. You don\u2019t watch to discover if your bullets land true. Rather, your eyes fix on the next target, the next victim.\n\nAnd just as you hoped, they aren\u2019t covered by the Veil. At least not at first. Three fall to the dirt, their hoods removed from covering their faces, exposed like you. Perfect bullet-sized holes lie in the center of their foreheads. A crater of blood starts to pour down the sides of their faces, soon to grace their bodies in a crimson pool. Three. You\u2019re able to drop three before the Veil extends to the remainder.\n\nTerr\u2019ok screams in fury at the sudden loss of his brethren.\n\nEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\n\u201cYour own\u201d screech projects from your mouth, drops of spit fly from your lips, brought upon by the rage building within Amir\u2019sshan. You use it as fuel, a source of energy yet untapped. The remaining S\u2019umbra won\u2019t be dropped by marksmanship; they\u2019ll have to be handled with a more hands on approach. Fine with you. You\u2019ve been relying on the six-shooter too much. Might as well put your sword skills to the test. They\u2019ve felt a little neglected as of late.\n\nBlack smoke. Thunderclouds. The black blade once again threatens the S\u2019umbra. It\u2019s a weapon they recognize, something that was buried deep within the halls of the dead, hoped to be lost to eternity. Amir\u2019sshan will not stay buried. Amir\u2019sshan will not be forgotten. The man(mad)-god makes his presence known, felt, in the form of a black blade with a wing-tipped hilt.\n\nThe Blackbird priests don\u2019t just allow you to cut them down. Flames, real fire, not from ravenlight, ignite at the tops of their staves, near the carved raven. In an instant, you know that they are the ones who greeted the Alteran voyage on arrival to the New World. The fire does not arrive in siege form, however; that might bring the entire cavern down. Streaks of small flame, like piercing arrows, fly towards you.\n\nAmir\u2019sshan shapes into a tower shield, a defensive tool that covers your body from damn near ankles to neck. Fire impacts against the shield, each a bright flash of light, each a steady impact against your arm. Underneath the cover of the shield, you rely upon the feel of battle. Unable to view with your eyes--unless you risk exposing your face to the flame--you draw upon other senses to guide you, the cadence of the flame against the shield, the sound of the high priests casting their spells, knowledge that they can\u2019t continue at this pace for much longer. It\u2019s only a matter of time--\n\n--daylight! Figuratively speaking. A window of opportunity opens before you, and like any good thief scouring the streets of Alteran\u2019s capital city, you don\u2019t squander the chance. The flame lets up for just a brief moment, the pause between each inhale and exhale, the moment when eyes see but the mind does not register: the moment when magic is spent, making the caster vulnerable to an ex-soldier and a god trapped in a mithril weapon.\n\nThe six-shooter will not help you with the Veil in place, so, instead, you allow Amir\u2019sshan to do as he pleases. Rather than sticking with weapons that you\u2019re familiar with, hold mastery over, you give Amir\u2019sshan the freedom to shape as necessary, for the desire to cut down the priests are equally shared between you two. His, a revenge building over thousands of years in torment, trapped. Yours, a conviction to remove such people from power, starting first with the people of the New World, then moving to the Old.\n\nBlack smoke. Thunderclouds. Spear. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. Longsword. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. Axe. Black smoke. Thundercl...\n\nDeath.\n\nStanding around the fallen S\u2019umbra, you focus your attention on Terr\u2019ok. The bodies of his fellow priests lie scattered at your feet, limbs in unnatural positions, all mysticism absent from their now exposed faces and shattered staves. There stands only two now: you and Terr\u2019ok.\n\n\u201cThe Raven whispers to me,\u201d he utters. \u201cIt comes to me in my dreams. Amir\u2019sshan is my destiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all fates are desired,\u201d you answer. \u201cYou dream of your death. And the nightmare is upon you.\u201d\n\nYou charge forward, Amir\u2019sshan becoming the state of his prison\u2019s origin, the dagger sought after by Redding and Alexander. The man-god, trapped and buried in the Blackbird halls of the dead. The destiny of Terr\u2019ok, high priest of the S\u2019umbra. The artifact. Amir\u2019sshan and the last bondsman. Terr\u2019ok twirls his staff as if a martial monk of the Old World, the kind who spend a lifetime secluded in a monastery preparing for combat. The carved raven becomes a blur, the staff itself melding into a streak of brown. The flow emerges. It reigns above all else. The mind is of no ally here; it brings overthought, past memories that hold no place on the field of battle. All that matters is your next breath. The present. Training takes over. The flow gently soothes your mind to sleep, allowing the body to rely on its own reaction time--far quicker when operating solely. The staff twirls, attacks appearing seemingly out of nowhere from the blur.\n\nThen, understanding.\n\nThe body catches the cadence of Terr\u2019ok\u2019s movements like a child jumping rope. There\u2019s a steady pace to his attacks...and a steady opening. Sure enough, all it takes is waiting for the next opening and--\n\n--the black mithril dagger, the vessel that Terr\u2019ok\u2019s ancestors trapped Amir\u2019sshan within, buries deep into the priest\u2019s neck. In an instant, the staff stops in motion, falling from Terr\u2019ok\u2019s hands. It falls to the cavern in a crash, bouncing from end to end before finding its final resting spot, much like its owner soon will. Terr\u2019ok takes a step forward, his hood falling from his face. His face exposed, the priest\u2019s eyes are wide in surprise as often is the case for one meeting their end.\n\nTerr\u2019ok takes a final step forward, both arms stretched out, empty, seeking to land on your shoulders for support. You take a step back and let the man fall to the ground, never to rise again. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. Amir\u2019sshan becomes an axe in your hand. The Blackbirds will demand proof of the S\u2019umbra\u2019s intervention. You\u2019ll provide it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Epilogue: The Last Bondsman", "result": "They\u2019re waiting for you as you exit the gauntlet. A man entered the trial, an outsider from across the Great Sea. The one that stands before them now is a legend, a name to be spoken for all eternity. The gauntlet of the gods is a trial few have withstood over the span of the Blackbird people--and never before has an outsider passed. Gripping Terr\u2019ok\u2019s severed head by his hair, loose tendrils of dripping blood mark your journey, spilling from the priest\u2019s open neck. You raise it high for all to see.\n\nThey stand as a crowd, backed by natural ravenlight of the cave, a fitting shade for the present moment. The gauntlet opened up to the top of an underground hill. At the top, you look down at the crowd before you. It\u2019s mostly filled with warriors, yet that much is true of the Harri\u2019ar themselves. For the first time, they look up to you, their large size paling in comparison to the hill, both physically and symbolically. Amir\u2019sshan, once again as a dagger, rests on your hip. He speaks through you.\n\n(Blasphemers!)\n\nCompelled by the man-god, you toss the severed head of Terr\u2019ok into the crowd of Blackbirds. A roar erupts, the sound of rumbling thunder coaxed into existence by storm clouds. Hands grip axe handles and tighten around spear shafts. The Blackbird warriors await your (Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s) next words, for they will dictate whether you will be allowed to live or not.\n\n(Is this who you would worship in my absence? Priests masquerading as true devotees of the Raven, ones who would use my name for their own gain?)\n\nThe words themselves are much like the initial word screamed by Amir\u2019sshan. Blashemper. Looks, born of puzzlement and rage, are met in return. Did the outsider claim to be the Raven? More than a few weapons are drawn now, warriors deeming your words poorly chosen, a disrespect spoken to the Raven that must be answered in blood. Several of them attack. They charge the underground hill with a cry, a scream of righteous fury to their god. You cut them down. The very spirit of Amir\u2019sshan possesses you, and you move like the man-god himself, the chieftain of chieftains.\n\nYou discard the headdress that was placed upon your head; its feathers plucked, you have no time for impurity. It falls to the ground in the same manner of the S\u2019umbra. Amir\u2019sshan wishes to remain a dagger. You can work with that. You meet the charge of the Blackbird warriors, not with one of your own. Instead, you walk towards them, casually, like the way a nobleman strolls the streets of the capital city, eyeing shops and mannequins displaying the latest, finest overcoats. Their swings are telegraphed, born of rage and wildly arced. You dodge, sidestepping just out of range, mere inches away from their axes. The artifact finds a home in their necks, each Blackbird warrior felled with a single thrust of the blade, all dying by the same wound, the very one that ended the life of their leader, Terr\u2019ok. With bodies of those in opposition around you, the words spoken from Amir\u2019sshan have great effect, the message behind them clear: join or die.\n\n(Your god has returned. Behold! The Raven incarnate!)\n\nWhat are you doing? I thought the vessel was breaking.\n(Did I say that? Oops. I lied.)\nYou tried to have me willingly surrender my body.\n(Once again, oops.)\nYou'll not have me.\n(We\u2019ll see about that.)\n\nThe Blackbird crowd, if they weren\u2019t in an uproar before, now definitely are. Hands gripping weapons now raise them against one another. Like a fissure splitting the earth, the Blackbirds become two parties, one in support of Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s claim and the other ready to succeed where Terr'ok failed. Their shouts are louder than any Alteran market, each voice seemingly louder than an Alteran quartermaster barking orders at sailors. Infighting ensues. Blackbird on Blackbird, tribe against tribe. They were united under the S\u2019umbra\u2019s rule. Now, however, they\u2019re split. Able to think freely for themselves, yet their thoughts spill blood against one another.\n\nMore charge the hill, those in support of your claim at their heels, chopping at ankles and attempting to hamstring their fellow people. Through the madness E\u2019ffy appears. Her face is like the sun peering through a cloudy day, a warm welcome in an otherwise dreary day. The tattoos are her wrists illume with magic, her holy power smiting those who stray too close, Redding next to her doing the same with his longsword. They cut their way towards you, having to avoid the pile of growing bodies at your feet.\n\n\u201cKid, why the hell are you claiming to be their god?\u201d Redding shouts over the swing of his sword.\n\nBefore you can answer, E\u2019ffy interjects. \u201cBecause Amir\u2019sshan is seeping into him. Becoming him. The bondsman is finally fulfilling his task.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecoming me?\u201d you question. \u201cI refused his offer.\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy laughs, normally a comforting sign. In this moment, however, it sends chills down your spine. It sounds wrong, somehow, an innocent tone in the face of cruelty, like a troubled child giggling as he kills small animals. \u201cAmir\u2019sshan does not ask. He takes. Consumes. It is the duty of the bondsman to bring the second coming.\u201d\n\nAnger rushes into your body. Anger at being lied to. Anger at being used. After all you\u2019ve been through, your life is thought as nothing, simply a soul in the way of the man-god\u2019s. Damn the artifact. Damn the Blackbirds. You\u2019re through with both. You wish that you\u2019d never chosen to come to the war camp. Your grip tightens around the dagger. With a yell, you throw the artifact in to the sea of fighting natives. You\u2019re done with it. Let another, a true devotee, bear the burden. You don\u2019t even believe in the Raven, and you\u2019re sure there\u2019s more than a few present who would gladly surrender their life for Amir\u2019sshan, E\u2019ffy counted as one of them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I think of your sacred artifact,\u201d you shout, your voice ringing above the sounds of battle. Finally, you\u2019re rid of the thing. Let the natives fight each other to determine the next wielder. Suddenly, weight appears in your palm, a familiar wing-tipped handle rests in your hand. A sickening feeling rumbles in your stomach, and the meal eaten the night before threatens to jump ship. The artifact, it returned.\n\n(Not so fast, hero.)\n\nEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nYour mind screams a pitch similar to Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s, taking on his demeanor the way spending long amounts of time with another cause picked-up habits. Seems you\u2019re stuck with the artifact for the time being. Redding extends a worried glance in your direction; E\u2019ffy displays the exact opposite, a constant grin at her lips. Her arm reaches out and touches your shoulder. It's comforting, reassuring.\n\n\u201cIt is a great honor to be in your service, Raven.\u201d\n\nYou do not respond at first, though you sense Amir\u2019sshan allowing you to do so. Allowing you. Allowing you to speak for yourself. The man-god spent centuries trapped within a prison of black mithril; it\u2019s early, yet you have a feeling you\u2019re taking the first few steps onto his path, the prison being your own body.\n\nNo.\n\nYou\u2019ll not surrender easily. You never have. You\u2019ll not start now. The battlefield has simply shaped form, much like the artifact itself. Rather than fighting by traditional means, you\u2019ll be battling for control of your mind, of your body. You sense the disapproval within and send your own in response. One body. Two souls in constant struggle over one another. You\u2019re not quite done living yet. There\u2019s much you haven\u2019t gotten around to due to military service. An entire New World lies at your feet, a freedom surpassing all that you\u2019ve experience before. You\u2019ll not be chained, conscripted, bound to any other. A mental surge overtakes Amir\u2019sshan\u2019s hands playing puppeteer. You\u2019re in control. You\u2019ll do as you want.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am,\u201d you state flatly. \u201cThe man-god is under my control, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy\u2019s face turns dark. Backed by ravenlight, it almost becomes formless. \u201cOnly the S\u2019umbra threaten the Raven in that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe S\u2019umbra are no more. Same for the \u2018second coming.\u2019 There is only me and my ambition.\u201d (EEEEEEEEEE) Turning to Redding, seeing his face still shows concern, you add, \u201cOur task here is complete. There is much work to be done, is there not?\u201d\n\nRedding\u2019s expression becomes blank, his card-playing face. \u201cThere is always work to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are leaving then,\u201d E\u2019ffy speaks.\n\nYou nod.\n\n\u201cThen I am coming with you.\u201d\n\nYou offer her another gesture. This one, a shrug.\n\n\u201cNot a bad idea,\u201d Redding says, \u201cto have a Blackbird ally along with us.\u201d\n\nE\u2019ffy doesn\u2019t correct the term. Old habits. You glance at the battlefield before you, the physical one. Infighting between tribes, a people raising axes and spears against one another. It is necessary for change. You have a feeling you will be doing the same with the people of the Old World as they voyage to the New. It\u2019s the natural order of things. The Old must die for the New to survive, like a snake shedding dead skin. Within, Amir\u2019sshan settles down, the sudden outburst from the voice calmed for a moment. The internal struggle will continue. That's for damn sure. For now, however, the external struggle must be the main focus. Blackbird warriors climb the hill towards you.\n\nBlack smoke. Thunderclouds. They climb to their death.\n\nYou\u2019ll cut your way through the Blackbirds and leave the war camp, Redding and E\u2019ffy along with you. The S\u2019umbra are no more. Each Blackbird tribe is free to act on their own, and with their new-found freedom, they seek to end your life. So be it. Some lend their support, but not nearly the majority--not even near half of them. You\u2019ll cut them down as free men; they\u2019ve chosen their path, and you, yours. Their choice leads to a dead end. Yours, on the other hand, is just beginning. The New World awaits you.

It\u2019s not the way you treat an ally. On the field of battle, there\u2019s no mercy. Simply, it can not exist if death is to be escaped. Here, however, there\u2019s room for it; need for it, a trust that\u2019s built between fellow members.\n\nInstead of ending the skirmish with a single blow, you hold back.\n\nVisible anger appears on her face. E\u2019ffy\u2019s mouth becomes a tight slit, eyes following closely in the shape. The redness on her face, a subtle shade of crimson, begins to glow brighter, adding to the physical proof of exertion. The whites of her eyes expand, nostrils flared.\n\n\u201cThat is a mistake, bondsman,\u201d she utters.\n\n(I whole-heartedly agree.)\n\nWith a cry, she then takes the offensive against you. E\u2019ffy charges forward, arm cocked back to throw all of her weight and momentum into a single punch. You welcome it. Best to let the woman take her aggression out, even if her aggression might take the form of a bruise on your cheek the next day.\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d\n\nChieftain Malic\u2019ant\u2019s voice stops E\u2019ffy mid-step, like the wind was taken out of her sails, the anchor dropped at the exact same moment. She stops, turns, and faces her father. You remain where you are, noticing Redding and Onng watching from a distance. The chieftain\u2019s hall becomes silent as any grave, as any morning after burying the dead the day before.\n\n\u201cStep forward, outsider,\u201d the chieftain orders. You comply. It takes exactly twelve steps to reach the other side of the training pit towards Malic\u2019ant. With a half grunt-half groan of annoyance, the large Blackbird stands to his feet, pulling himself upright with his spear, at the same time waving off his royal guard, or whatever the chieftain protectorate is called. Crippled from age, Malic\u2019ant still towers above you. Standing in his shadow is like finding a great oak in the midday of summer.\n\n\u201cYou showed my daughter mercy,\u201d he flatly growls.\n\nYou find yourself nodding. \u201cShe is not my enemy, a worthy opponent, however.\u201d\n\n(Suck up.)\n\nChieftain Malic\u2019ant ponders a moment. His hand raises to scratch at his chin, the other remains firmly grasped around his spear. Up close, the spear is razor sharp, expectedly so. Feathers line the top, sending the blade protruding from underneath a wing, a common analogy for the Harri\u2019ar. Malic\u2019ant\u2019s eyes scan you for signs of deception, the look every father gives his daughter\u2019s guest, especially that of a male variety.\n\n\u201cYou do not have my blessing.\u201d\n\nBehind you, E\u2019ffy spits on the ground. She doesn\u2019t look surprised, however. She must have known the path your actions set you upon. Onng wears a similar expression; Redding, oddly enough, looks disinterested. His mind is made up either way. Having the blessing of the Blackbird people is simply a formality in his mind. Whether having the backing of E\u2019ffy\u2019s father, he\u2019s still going to take the fight to the S\u2019umbra.\n\nAfter all of this, the struggle that you\u2019ve undergone, making yourself enemies of both superpowers in the Old World, to find yourself here, at E\u2019ffy\u2019s father\u2019s hut denied, sends more than a single thought of rage into your mind. Not to E\u2019ffy\u2019s extent, but you\u2019ve not exactly shown a containment over passion yourself. The two of you are similar in that way, yet one is but a sliver of the other.\n\n\u201cAnd just why is that?\u201d you find yourself saying.\n\n\u201cYou do not hold the strength to do what is necessary,\u201d the chieftain says. \u201cYou have skill, yes. But in the moment when action was required most, you did not do what needed to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your own daughter!\u201d\n\n\u201cAND YOU SHAME HER BY NOT GIVING A WARRIOR\u2019S DEFEAT.\u201d\n\nDespite the lower volume, his next words seethe with more rage than the words shouted.\n\n\u201cBondsman or no, you do not have what it takes. Find another\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nYou know there\u2019s not a single other chieftain in the war party that would lend support. The ability to defeat the S\u2019umbra by lawful ways ends here. You\u2019ve still got Amir\u2019sshan and Redding who would die fighting by your side. E\u2019ffy, you know, won\u2019t approve of any unlawful means.

No stranger to combat, you know a taunt when you hear one. Who is supposed to win? The one who is stronger. If you\u2019re discerning the exchange correctly, then E\u2019ffy is seemingly attempting to get you to charge in. And why wouldn\u2019t she? Blackbird warriors stand a full head taller than the average Alteran. With the added size, comes added strength. If the priestess, daughter of the chieftain, was raised in that environment, then of course she wants you to be the aggressor.\n\nYou stand out of striking distance from her, arms raised defensively. She does the same, stalking you like a jungle cat, looking for an opening to pounce. At the end of the hall, you sense Malic\u2019ant\u2019s eyes, watching intently. Whether he views the \u201ccustom\u201d from an honorable chieftain or proud father, you know not. Perhaps a bit of both, which makes you even more uneasy about the whole circumstance. Sort of a damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t situation. You\u2019ve found yourself in plenty worse, and you managed to escape those without too much of an issue. This\u2019ll be the same. You continue to wait patiently, letting your mind take the reins, despite the body\u2019s longing to rush into battle. E\u2019ffy seems to do the same. Then, her mind folds to the urge of battle.\n\nShe charges in, swingingly first with the left, then with the right. Easily recognized. The left is to set up the power right. Your feet guide you just beyond reach of the power shot. As her right hand barely misses, you fire a foot into the woman\u2019s gut. The sole of your foot lands squarely in E\u2019ffy\u2019s lower stomach, doubling her over. You don\u2019t follow up, however. Patience has guided you this far, and you\u2019ll lean on her again. The blow, damaging physically, is more damaging to the ego. From when you first met E\u2019ffy, you\u2019ve learned that her emotions guide her, often changing like the weather. Sunny one moment, cloudy the next. Watch out for storm clouds. The way she fights is no different; it\u2019s who she is.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn to taunt. You motion with both hands, come on. It brings the desired effect. E\u2019ffy\u2019s face narrows as she charges towards you, just as expected. Again, you slide back out of reach and--\n\n--take a hook, one to the body and one to the head. At the last possible moment, the priestess shifted her weight, turning like a nimble ship on the water, and cutting off your backstep, closing into striking range before you had a chance to raise a defense. The punches stun you for a second. More importantly, they wake you up to the reality set before you. The Blackbird people earn respect by a show of strength. It doesn\u2019t matter if the skirmish is between a man or a woman, something that would be unheard of in the Old World. Two warriors face each other, and the stronger will come out victorious. The relationship between the woman and the chieftain doesn\u2019t matter at this moment. Neither does potential hurt feelings. Not even the S\u2019umbra matters at this moment. There\u2019s battle and the path to victory. That\u2019s it.\n\nWith your new-found thoughts, you enter the flow state. Your mind becomes a distant ally; your body does as it\u2019s spent countless hours training to do. Every movement from E\u2019ffy causes a reaction from you. Her strikes are blocked or dodged, each one bringing a counter from your own arsenal. The tide turns quickly. You may not be as strong, physically, as a Blackbird warrior, but you possess strength beyond average for your size, speed nearly on par with E\u2019ffy\u2019s.

Instantly, the doors to the inner sanctum swing open, which is not how you would expect someone to enter into a religious place\u2026.unless\u2026.unless the newcomer isn\u2019t concerned about disrupting the holy place because they hold themselves to a different religion. E\u2019ffy did say there weren\u2019t many supporters for her sect of worship.\n\nA lone man enters, leaving his Blackbird escorts behind. The warriors stand guard just outside, which means either they\u2019re more concerned with keeping people out than protecting their master. Which also means the man isn\u2019t worried about the danger that stands before him now, the four of you. He\u2019s dressed in purple robes, dark and tattered at the edges. His face remains hidden in a deep hood. The man removes it though, revealing Terr\u2019ok, high priest of the S\u2019umbra, acting chieftain of chieftains, enemy of E\u2019ffy.\n\n\u201cE\u2019ffy, my girl,\u201d he purrs, a voice that would soothe coming from someone else\u2019s--anyone--else\u2019s mouth. He\u2019s not old for a priest, perhaps nearing forty, giving him ample years to hone his craft while still maintaining the vigor of youth, a dangerous foe indeed, likely in the prime of his lifetime, where both body and mind are still sharp. The man leans on a wooden staff, awaiting E\u2019ffy\u2019s reply. The very tip of the staff boasts a small carving of a raven.\n\n\u201cTerr\u2019ok,\u201d E\u2019ffy confirms his identity. Tare-ock. \u201cHave you come here seeking salvation?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, my dear, that has already been secured. Yours, however\u2026\u201d Terr\u2019ok trails off. As he starts speaking again, a cry escapes your lips. It\u2019s not of your own doing. Its compulsion is that of grabbing a smouldering coal and the instinct to drop it immediately.\n\n(EEEEEEEEE)\n\nTHe same compulsion brings you forward, artifact appearing in your hand as a blade. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. If the man is surprised by your actions, he doesn\u2019t show it. Your companions seem more surprised by the sudden move, minus Redding, who joins your attack. A man of action, that Redding. Terr\u2019ok remains in place with both hands on the wooden staff, you and Redding bearing down on him with weapons drawn. At the last possible moment, the high priest bursts into motion. The staff in his hands whirls as if a leaf in the wind; his footsteps carry him a perfect two steps backward. Not just a man of the cloth it would seem. Perhaps that\u2019s the Blackbird way.\n\nTerr\u2019ok\u2019s steps take him just out of reach from yours and Redding\u2019s blades, both swinging through empty air in the place where the man stood a second earlier. The voice thunders in your head, and like watching events play out in a dreamstate, you\u2019re merely a spectator as the words of Amir\u2019sshan pour through your own mouth.\n\n(REVENGE IS AT LAST MINE.)\n\n\u201cThe mad-god holds true to his name,\u201d Terr\u2019ok fires back, his hands returning to resting on the staff, a symbol of his strength originating from his deity.\n\nThe artifact seems to shut you out. You cannot move or talk of your own accord, trapped beneath your body\u2019s new driver, the reins now firmly held by a being, possibly immortal--possibly mad. Perhaps both. By now the Blackbird escort rushes into the temple, drawn by the commotion. They\u2019re protected by leather armor, each carrying an axe in either hand. You\u2019ve grown used to looking up at the warriors; they stand a full head taller than the average Alteran, after all. The two newcomers are a different breed, however. They stand two--maybe two and a half--feet taller. Black paint covers their faces, the whites of their eyes and snarling teeth giving them a phantom-like demeanor.\n\nThey may tower above you, but they\u2019ll fall just like the others. Amir\u2019sshan changes shape within your palm. The black blade becomes the six-shooter, by far your preferred weapon and the artifact sure as hell knows it. Since you first felt the standard issue Alteran flintlock in your palm, you\u2019ve felt comfortable with weapons powered by gunpowder, which is not something all soldiers of Alteran are drawn towards. Redding, for example, rarely fires a side piece, preferring the steady swing of a fixed blade. Just as the lich fell, just as countless others, you see your targets. The six-shooter raises. And you fire.\n\nTwo shots ring in the temple, a loud blast like a ship crashing onto the shore. One moment your targets stand in front of you. The next, your targets still stand in front of you. As if coins dropped into a collection pot, two lead bullets drop onto the temple floor, highlighting the sudden silence that followed your shots. The Blackbird warriors remain in front of you, unscatched. Smiling. Mocking.\n\n\u201cAmir\u2019sshan...the Veil,\u201d E\u2019ffy whispers.\n\nThat\u2019s when you notice it, a transparent shield hanging like a cloud layer around Terr\u2019ok and the warriors.\n\nTerr\u2019ok offers a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out of the mortal realm for too long. There are new powers, real powers that are beyond your shape shifting tricks.\u201d\n\nWhite hot anger sparks within you. It comes from the artifact\u2019s bond, yet you feel it as if it were your own. It\u2019s the feeling of learning a family member was set upon by highwaymen, a righteous passion by association. The six-shooter won\u2019t help you here. You\u2019ll have to defeat the man by traditional means. Another cry escapes your lips. You charge with the black blade in hand, Redding by your side to accompany your strikes. The two of you have fought side-by-side many times. Even in your brief time spent in the New World it\u2019s paid off, Redding countering after your defense, complimenting your movements with your own. Only, your movements aren\u2019t your own; the artifact steers the ship, and Redding is unfamiliar with such an ally.\n\nYou stumble over each other\u2019s steps, your now long, sweeping strikes with the blade--fueled by emotion--taking the place where precise, disciplined training once resided. The spirit of Amir\u2019sshan drives you forward; the style itself would normally be effective. Truly, it would if you stood as tall as the Blackbirds, if the hand guiding the sword possessed the same ancestral body type. You\u2019ve always been strong for an Alteran. You\u2019ve always been quicker than most. The Blackbirds are different, however, physical specimens born to battle hand-to-hand, forged by the constant danger of the New World and uncivilization.\n\nAn axe catches Redding in nearly the same area that he suffered not days ago. You wonder if he\u2019s completely healed or not, even if E\u2019ffy\u2019s healing magic closed up the wound. His body may not have the same strength as before, the byproduct of knocking on death\u2019s door and finding no one home to answer. The man, the former corporal collapses to the floor after a stumble forward, both hands clutching his side, his sword falling from grasp. Suddenly the anger becomes your own, spurred on by the sight of watching, perhaps, your oldest friend fall to the natives.\n\n(EEEEEEEEE)\n\nYou charge, willing the longsword to extend into a two-handed greatsword. If the artifact is going to affect the way you battle, then damn if you won\u2019t have a say in what form it decides to take. Besides, the heavy two-handed weapon is better for the large swings of Amir\u2019sshan.\n\n(This body is weak. It cannot hold my power.)\nThen go somewhere else and leave me alone!\n\nIn the middle of the battle, you catch a brief glimpse of E\u2019ffy. She and Onng have moved to the back of the temple, unwilling to take part in the fight.\n\nShe abandons us.\n(She doesn\u2019t agree.)\nThis is who we choose to fight for?\n(Ahhh so we\u2019re a \u2018we\u2019 now.)\nYes, as in WE would be better off if you controlled yourself.\n(Focus, hero. They--)\n\nThe voice is cut off. The same can be said for your right arm. One of the Blackbird\u2019s axes found an opening in your defence, the axe blade cleanly severing your limb from the elbow down. Battle shock takes over. You feel nothing. It\u2019s as if the sight of your severed arm at your feet isn\u2019t registering in your mind. Oddly enough, all you can think of is the way a fish flops on the ground after it\u2019s caught from the water, and you swear you see your arm twitch. The greatsword, only supported with one arm, seems to double in weight. Not that you have any faith in the outcome, the six-shooter appears in your left palm. If this is the end, you\u2019re going to go down firing. The Blackbirds close in. Terr\u2019ok smirks. E\u2019ffy watches. You fire six shots. Their axes tear your body apart.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Replenish", "result": "\u201cOn a second thought,\u201d you say, stomach grumbling. \u201cI might replenish if we will be here awhile.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. Supplies are through the doorway,\u201d E\u2019ffy says, turning to Ongg. They start a conversation in which you hear very little. The doorway leads into a long hallway filled with various paintings. They\u2019re primitive, sort of what the average Alteran would expect from the Blackbirds. Natural dyes, blotchy figures. They aren\u2019t aren\u2019t housed within extravagant frames like the Old World would display artwork. They\u2019re on slabs of gray stone, illumined by ravenlight, no doubt masking the actual dye colors in a ravenblack shade. You\u2019re fairly positive one of them would cost a fortune in Alteran, where art itself is already overpriced. An original Blackbird piece, the only one of its kind--yeah, you could live comfortably off one for a few years, you suppose.\n\nThe hallway continues into a small kitchen that doubles up as a storeroom. Wicker baskets line the edges, their contents mostly hidden by lids, although you see some (New World) rice and dried meats. It\u2019s the dried meat that you go for. Smoked and seasoned. Not a bad way to stave off hunger for a bit. You chip away at a sizable piece and slightly wonder what kind of animal you\u2019re eating. As far as you know, the Blackbirds aren\u2019t cannibals, despite the propaganda of Alteran. No, you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ve heard the term tossed in their direction before; they\u2019ll say anything though.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a person if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering,\u201d Redding breaks the silence, taking a sizable bit out of his own piece of meat.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was wondering,\u201d you say. Redding finds a jug and pours some of its contents into a cup. It\u2019s a type of red wine. You connect the dot with the Blackbird paintings. \u201cYou know, somewhere across the sea there\u2019s an Alteran nobility who would give a small fortune for a cup of Blackbird wine. The same goes for the drawings on the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet the wine and paintings are cheaply acquired here,\u201d Redding completes the thought. \u201cCup?\u201d\n\nYou nod. While you realize the importance of keeping your wits about, the opportunity to taste Blackbird wine is something that you simply cannot pass up. You locate a cup, an unmarked thing of clay, and offer it to Redding, who finishes his and fills his own cup again before getting to yours.\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d you say, clinking the small cups together. Sweetness assaults your tongue. The flavor is close to the berries that E\u2019ffy picked for you earlier. There\u2019s something else, however. A deep flavor that you can only describe as smokiness, like the flavor of campfire, cooking a roasted...Oh. The flavor of the dried meat was likely still in your mouth. Still, it\u2019s not a bad combination with the sweet flavor of the wine. For the first time since encountering E\u2019ffy in the jungle and asking for her help, it\u2019s you and Redding alone.\n\n\u201cRegret coming here?\u201d you ask.\n\nRedding takes a bite of jerky and finishes with a sip of wine. \u201cNot at the present moment, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after your stomach is full?\u201d\n\nHe pauses to think. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. If what the girl says is true, then the Blackbirds are poisoned by the same thing as the Old World...likely an aftereffect of the first explorers.\u201d\n\nMeaning his ancestor, Jeremiah Reddish, helped poison the New World, but you don\u2019t voice it. Speaking ill of the dead is always unwarranted for an Alteran, especially when it\u2019s a family member of the one you\u2019re speaking with.\n\n\u201cStill,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe girl is a poor planner. That much is clear. Any sort of surprise advantage we had by our alliying is gone. Not that I have much experience with removing tribal leaders from power, but that sort of thing probably works best without announcing your attention and walking through the front door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can agree on that,\u201d you say. \u201cThey certainly do things differently than in Alteran here. And it\u2019s not just E\u2019ffy: the guards posted allowed us to walk in freely. It\u2019s like a handshake agreement. There are no secrets to anyone\u2019s intention. The guards will follow whoever\u2019s at the top, and E\u2019ffy and the S\u2019umbra will try to remove each other from the tribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what it is,\u201d Redding leads you on like a schoolmaster. \u201cHonor. Or what they consider to be honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMhmm. As long as they face each other in open battle, it\u2019s allowed. Encouraged probably. Plotting, lying, scheming: the traits of the New World haven\u2019t reached them yet, despite their tyrannous government structure. We\u2019re allowed to stroll through the front door, telling the guards that we\u2019re here to kill their leader, and they wave us through.\u201d\n\n\u201cKill? Here I thought we were going to peacefully remove them from office.\u201d\n\nYou ignore Redding\u2019s sarcasm. \u201cBut also, that means when the S\u2019umbra hear of our arrival, and you can be damn sure they have already, it is completely within the realm of possibility that they march on us with all their strength. For honor calls for it.\u201d\n\n(Now you\u2019re getting it.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Redding muses, taking another sip. \u201cA place like this is sacred. From what I\u2019ve learned about the Blackbirds, starting violence in the temple is a big no-no.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re safe in one building alone,\u201d you answer. \u201cBetter get comfortable here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWay ahead of you there, kid.\u201d Redding finishes his second cup.\n\n\u201cTake it easy. We\u2019d better get back to E\u2019ffy,\u201d you say. Redding takes another glance at the wine, ponders a moment, and then leaves it behind. Back the way you go, past the paintings that would cost a pretty penny in Alteran, back to E\u2019ffy in the main chamber of the temple.

A man would be executed. The tribe puts up with the woman.\n\nThat girl. That dreadful girl. A thorn in the paw. Nothing more than that.\n\nThe outsiders have sailed across the Great Sea in their wooden horses. They have set upon the land with no regard for the Earth Mother and Father Sun.

What has happened before will happen again. Terr\u2019ok, High Priest of the S\u2019umbra will send them to defeat once again.\n\nIt began with an idea. No, that\u2019s not true. It began with a vision from the Raven Himself. A dream came to Terr\u2019ok. At that time he was a lowly shaman, a magician, with no order to uphold his faith. A man cut from the order is weak, a lone branch to be snapped in half. With the order, however, with the combined strength they are a mighty fortress, a wall reinforced with the binding of power.\n\nThunder crashed. Lightning flashed across the nightsky, an otherwise starless night. In a single bolt, the entire heavens were revealed, stars appearing into existence for a brief moment before hiding back behind the veil. Terr\u2019ok, exposed to the elements, stood at the top of a mountain; rocks as black as the sky above rested underneath his leather boots. He was dressed in dark purple ceremonial robes, the only clothes he owns. The mountainside was unforgiving. Jagged rocks lined his path, attempting to throw him from the pilgrimage in a deadly fall, or even worse, a stumble of the foot, leaving him with a broken bone to face the ferocity of nature. A minor nuisance. Nothing would get in the way of his path. Not nature, not the elements, not even the Father Sun Himself. Blasphemy. Heretical. Terr\u2019ok was set upon the path. All else be damned.\n\nThe thought frightened him. A man taught from an early age to follow the way of the gods should feel fear when opposing the very ideology that he was born to fulfill. Unless they taught him wrong. Unless the very ideology that he was meant to follow was wrong. A child does not know right from wrong, the truth from lies. They do as they are told. If they are scolded, then they know what to avoid. But who was to say their teacher is right? It was pure chance. Luck. Still, the afterlife is not something to be taken lightly. A man only had one chance at living right.\n\nLightning flashed. Shadows returned to their constant stalk.\n\nThe very heavens opened up and rain poured down upon Terr\u2019ok. His robe was soaked through, clinging to his body like a second layer of skin. His beard held a steady drip, like a wine pitcher with a leak at the bottom. The voice guided him this far, foreign at first. Small whisperings in the night, pointing, guiding. Subtle at first. Now with his ear attuned, it might as well be the thunder crashing overhead.\n\nGo. Climb. Find.\n\nAlways in small words. Simple words of actions. It pained him greatly early on. Go where? Climb what? Find what? The magnitude of a misinterpretation is great. He could arrive in the wrong place. Climb the wrong mountain. Find the wrong artifact. Wrong, wrong, wrong. A man only had one chance at living right. One chance. Slowly, he learned. A small action, originating from a single word. Confirmation. Go. Climb. Find. Decades he has followed the voice, now his greatest ally. It\u2019s saved his life, ended others\u2019. The tribe doesn\u2019t understand. Only but a few do. They will be well rewarded for their belief, their bravery in the face of misguided ideology and religion. S\u2019umbra. The voice whispered it in his ear, showed Terr\u2019ok a vision of what the sect of the Raven could accomplish by unifying the tribes. One day.\n\nUpon the mountain, the Raven showed him the way. The Raven! The voice that spoke in his mind was from the Raven. Terr\u2019ok climbed to the top of the mountain, to the very top of the world. All stood before him, below him. What the outsiders called the New World was but a small speck on Mother Earth before him. This is the view of the Raven! A vantage point overlooking all life; the heavens were but an arm\u2019s reach away. At the top, a naturally formed altar rested. It\u2019s made from blackrock, not exactly smooth on the top, but flat enough. It\u2019s rough, as things often are. On it sat a dagger, wing-tipped handle, its blade black.\n\nFollow. Take.\n\nTwo simple words. Follow the Raven. Take the artifact. It lies buried, guarded by the last bondsman and his warriors, a fate of eternal unrest thrust upon them, which they gladly took. For even in death--undeath--those devoted to the Raven will surrender their lives, just as they did walking among the living. The bondsman, a priest of tremendous power, powerful enough to bind his soul and those of his warriors to the halls of the dead, bound as protectors, sacrificing their eternal souls in the process. Their devotion is little compared to Terr\u2019ok\u2019s.\n\nThe once-shaman stepped forward towards the altar. Thunder boomed. Lighting illuminated the nightsky for a second\u2019s fraction. For a brief moment, in place of a dagger was a man, ghastly in form, a body that cannot be counted as physical. His face, hideous. Sinister. Not in the way one would expect. Not scarred, misshapen. It\u2019s symmetrical, like many of the great chieftains who fathered hundreds of children. No, the phantom\u2019s face brought a new meaning to the word. It\u2019s what the man behind the face knows, terrible secrets and the strength to enact each one, a mind unforged, running rampant like the jungle of the land. Cruelty followed the face, sure as the Father Sun will rise each morning. Death preceded it. Followed it. Yearned for it.\n\nThat girl. That dreadful girl is on her way to the war camp. Terr\u2019ok\u2019s eyes have told him as such. And she is arriving with two outsiders. They are under her protection for the moment. Terr\u2019ok\u2019s lips turn upward in a smile, true as the day, yet it would look forced to any observer. The girl is putting herself at risk too. Should the chieftains decide she has abandoned the family for the outsiders, her fate will be the same as theirs, daughter of Chieftain Malic\u2019ant or no. Yes, Terr\u2019ok\u2019s smile continues. The Raven\u2019s will be done.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}, null]}]}, {"action": "Garrison field surgeon", "result": "You shake your head towards the woman. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I need the aid of these men.\u201d What you don\u2019t mention is your skeptical feelings towards Blackbird medicine. Perhaps they\u2019re capable of treating Redding by natural means, but you\u2019re not willing to take the chance, not when you know several experienced field surgeons lie a few hundred feet in front of you, despite your circumstance.\n\n(Way to let her down easy.)\nShush.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfurl your black wings and wait...\u201d\n\n\u201c...Let the wind carry you home,\u201d you complete the farewell in her native tongue. (You\u2019re welcome.) She looks surprised at first, just barely more than yourself. Then the smile appears, flashing quickly, before turning stoic again as if remembering something grim. She says a final thing before disappearing in the forest in a blur of tanned leather and black beautiful hair. You find yourself hoping there\u2019ll be a third meeting. Only time will tell.\n\n\u201cThe Raven wills it. Amir\u2019sshan will guide you.\u201d\n\nAny thoughts of youth depart. You\u2019re required to be a soldier. You harden your mind for the task at hand. Damn! If you had known the Alteran battalion would be here, you would have traveled through the hidden tunnel into the garrison dungeon. The artifact would be able to unlock any door along the way. It\u2019s too risky now. Hours there, more hours back as stealth is slow going, and then more hours there. Nothing is ever easy.\n\nIf you\u2019re being honest with yourself, there\u2019s only one way to approach. Whatever deal is made between Alteran and Magda doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there are wounded soldiers to attend to. Redding may be a distance away, but he falls into that category, just as long as it\u2019s a Magda doc treating him and not an Alteran. As you know, turncoats aren\u2019t well thought of.\n\nYou step out from the treeline into the open clearing. Almost instantly you\u2019re flagged down by two Alteran soldiers wearing navy blues. They rush over to you, swords in hand.\n\n\u201cStop! Hands up\u201d one of them shouts.\n\nYou instantly comply, throwing up two open palms. You don\u2019t recognize the two Alterans, and they don\u2019t seem to either. One of them, the same who spoke, grabs your shoulder rather forcefully and draws you toward the battalion like the way a mother would scold a son. The other pulls the longsword from your back. The artifact!\n\n(Please. I\u2019ve been disguising myself from mortals long before your precious High King was even a high babe. Look to your arm.)\n\nYour inner arm, close to your wrist, displays a black marking. The tattoo is similar to the ones the Blackbird woman possesses, a crown-like band wrapping around the entire limb.\n\nNot bad. Little suspicious for a random tattoo to appear, wouldn\u2019t you think?\n\nTingling runs through your arm. It\u2019s as if a blade of grass were blowing against your skin in the wind. As you look down, the tattoo is gone. Instead a small dark ring, ravenblack, encompasses your pointer finger.\n\nBetter. Just as long as there aren\u2019t any jewelry thieves around.\n(You better hope not. They\u2019d find it easier to take the finger than pry me from my perch.)\nGreat.\n\nYou give the equivalent of a mental groan.\n\n\u201cSergeant. We found him wandering the outskirts.\u201d As expected, the two soldiers bring you to their commanding officer. The High King loves his chain of command, after all. You already know how this story goes. The sergeant will pass you to his superior, who will do the exact same thing until a certain rank is reached, one that has actual decision-making authority. Until then, it\u2019s puff, puff, pass.\n\n\u201cPut him with the others,\u201d comes the grizzled voice of the sergeant. Interesting. His superiors must be busy with more important things. Well, there\u2019s a first for everything. Wait. The others? The two soldiers, your escorts, take you past the rows of Alteran soldiers, neatly arranged in formation. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any signs of battle, save for the one with the Blackbird war party. The garrison must have surrendered upon seeing the Alterans approaching. Their fort couldn\u2019t stand otherwise.\n\nThey lead you into the garrison through the hole in the gate. Inside the fort for the second time, things look very different. To be more accurate, it looks as if it were set on flame. Many of the square buildings display blackened burn marks, some burned down completely, large piles of ash. All the fires appear to be put out now, save for the one near the eastern wall, using logs built from fallen bodies, sending the scent of charred skin and hair into the air. Up on the ramparts, you spot Captain Briggs and Alexander. A table\u2019s been brought out, and they occupy opposite sides. The captains sip small cups of tea from the spotless white table cloth, the tiny clinking of tea cups sounding out of place for the chaos before you. Rules of war. The surrendering party must host their conqueror.\n\n(Time\u2019s running out.)\nYou think I don't know that?\n\nTo the western wall you finally see where your escorts are taking you. A few hundred, if you had to guess, Magda soldiers are grouped there, some seated on the dirt, others leaning against the wall. They\u2019re nothing like the well-armored soldiers that fought previously. Most don\u2019t wear their steel breastplates--actually, none of them do. Terms of surrender. Like you, their weapons have been taken, although none of them likely have an ancient artifact at their disposal. The Alterans don\u2019t take your leather armor from you, so the removal of the steel breastplates must be a slight at the Supreme Leader, exposing the Magdan\u2019s hearts vulnerable. A shove, and you\u2019re just another conquered soldier in the crowd.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame they didn\u2019t throw you in the dungeon. Then there would be a direct tunnel to Redding, and no locked door would stand in your way. Damn! Instead you\u2019re in the open for all to see. True, you\u2019re not locked up, but constant surveillance dampens your attempts far greater than any prison cell could. Already, you\u2019re scanning the fort for areas of escape. You\u2019ve already noted the dungeon. Perhaps you could cause some commotion to get you and another locked up...a field surgeon perhaps. Though it would need to be the right amount of disruption. Nothing too excessive, otherwise you risk the noose.\n\n\u201cStill making friends, I see.\u201d\n\nBefore you can respond, a punch lands in your gut. Instinctively, you retreat a few steps in the case of follow up blows. Safely away, your eyes find your attacker. Benjamin, sharp features, thin nose and chin. Without his steel breastplate and buckler, you see his body type matches his features.\n\n\u201cI seem to remember you already paid me back,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Benjamin says with a smile. \u201cThat one was because I wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOftly good spirits for a soldier who just surrendered his fort.\u201d\n\nThe smile disappears instantly, like sandy footprints washed away with the tide. \u201cAnd who\u2019s the blame for that? Interesting coincidence that not shortly after you \u2018defect,\u2019 the Alterans show up in full force. I wonder who led them here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh please,\u201d you start. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And after leading the Alterans to victory they took my sword and rewarded me with your company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you can\u2019t be trusted. You and that Redding. Where is he, by the way, deciding which army to betray next?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026\u201d you trail off, realizing that you\u2019re getting sidetracked with the bickering. \u201cWhat are they planning to do with us?\u201d\n\n\u201cUs? We\u2019re probably going to be sent back to Magda under the terms of never setting foot on the \u2018High King\u2019s New World\u2019 ever again. Rules of war, you know. The Supreme Leader will be furious, but I suppose, technically, no bloodshed actually took place, breaking the peace. You?\u201d Benjamin motions a finger across his throat.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d you utter. You silently wonder how difficult it would be to kidnap a field surgeon in front of two armies, that is if none will accompany you freely. If they are marching you through the forest, it\u2019s not a bad idea. The more seconds that go by, the more you\u2019re starting to think none will go freely. And why would they? Their life is currently not at risk. Rather than tromping through the overgrowth to save a turncoat\u2019s life, they get to go home. An Alteran surgeon could fix Redding up, but you have doubts on how convincing you\u2019ll be. They believe you betrayed them, after all. People tend not to listen to defectors, not that it\u2019s your fault your coat turned colors. Unfortunate, indeed.", "action_results": [{"action": "The dungeon", "result": "There\u2019s no telling how soon the garrison will be sent packing to the Old World. You don\u2019t have time to find out either. You need to act, and fast. You scan the crowd of Magda soldiers, looking for a doc. Off in the distance, you hear a laugh echo from the ramparts, followed by clinking of tea cups. Rules of war, you know. Still, it seems a tad insensitive for the garrison\u2019s leader to show such obvious enjoyment while his men are herded like farm animals.\n\nFinally your eyes land on a man near the edge of the soldiers. His build is thin. Like Benjamin, and a lot of the Magda soldiers, his features are sharp, a thin pair of spectacles sitting at the edge of his pointy nose. One look and you know he\u2019s not a soldier like the rest. Arms are too frail for a sword. Better suited for a scalpel. He\u2019s the small puppy barking directions at war horses. Just what you need.\n\n(I\u2019ve seen that look in many mortals before. You\u2019re about to get us into trouble, aren\u2019t you?)\nNo more than usual.\n\nYou hear the sound of Benjamin spitting as you walk away from the man. At least he\u2019s content to stay put. You don\u2019t need him following you around and causing problems. You imagine you\u2019ll have enough problems of your own, by your own making no less. Through the crowd of Magda soldiers you go, taking notice that you are the only one in motion. The rest simply stand around, waiting. They\u2019re about to have a hell of another show.\n\nThe man\u2019s hair is in the process of becoming more silver than brown, straight and combed back. Not long enough to be tied, but close. He notices you approach as most of the soldiers do. \u201cA man could get nervous with a fellow approaching like that,\u201d he says lightly. The good-natured voice likely has calmed more than a few \u201cexcited\u201d patients in his day.\n\n\u201cPerhaps in the dark of night. Here, however\u2026\u201d you display your arms out towards the hundreds of eyes upon you.\n\n\u201cWhat is it you want.\u201d The doc abandons his friendly opening.\n\n\u201cSpear wound under the arm. Clean, but deep. Very deep. Marginal loss of blood. How long can a man last?\u201d you ask.\n\nThe sudden question relating to his expertise draws the doc from his antagonist demeanor. He scratches his chin. \u201cFor a soldier in good health, assuming that\u2019s what you mean. Hmm. Oh I\u2019d not give the man more than a day unless treated properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s all I needed to know.\u201d You fumble with your hands a bit to draw the doc\u2019s eyes downward.\n\nNow comes the fun part.\n(Comparatively, I sense.)\n\nYou move quickly, far quicker than the doc can react to. You slide your body forward, while still keeping proper posture, the only movement a slight shifting of your feet, without long, winding motions of your body. The doc\u2019s gaze still down, he doesn\u2019t register it until it\u2019s too late. The bridge of your nose rams straight into the doc\u2019s forehead. By all intents and purposes, without the eyes deft enough to catch the entirety of the motion, it appears that the field surgeon headbutted you, a cheap shot.\n\nYou withdraw with, perhaps, too much of a dramatic flair, but it\u2019s attention you seek. And attention is damn well what you receive.\n\n\u201cBastard!\u201d you shout, clutching at your nose.\n\nThe doc doesn\u2019t seem to realize what is happening, and why should he? Who asks a medical question and then rams the soft part of their face into another\u2019s skull? He certainly doesn\u2019t realize you\u2019re firing \u201cback\u201d a shot of your own until your fist slams into his gut, doubling him over. You avoid his head for obvious reasons. He still needs his wits about him to heal Redding. Also, nine times out of ten an opponent doubled over will--\n\n--his body tackles yours to the ground. The odds land true. His shoulder lands in your stomach, sending an audible groan along with your air from your lungs. You eat a punch. And another. You take one more before hooking the doc\u2019s arm, trapping it, before reversing the position. Any time now... They don\u2019t break you up right away so you take the opportunity to place both hands around the man\u2019s throat, not tight enough to choke him completely, but just enough to make him squirm. Finally, you\u2019re pulled up by an Alteran under each arm.\n\n\u201cDid you see that? He headbutted me for no reason!\u201d you yell, playing the part of the righteously wronged. The blood pouring from your nostril adds a nice effect.\n\n\u201cThe boy is mad,\u201d the doc spits back.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who started it,\u201d an Alteran soldier says, dressed in navy blue. The statement flows with the ease of a father. \u201cYou\u2019re soldiers. Act like it. Now I want you to sit quietly until the meeting is over. Or else.\u201d He gestures towards the two captains sharing a pot of tea on the ramparts.\n\n\u201cNo! I won\u2019t let this...poor excuse for a surgeon get away with it! He let three of my friends die, and then attacked me when I brought it up.\u201d\n\n(Ease back, fellow.)\n\n\u201cI have no idea what he\u2019s talking about!\u201d the doc exclaims. \u201cI have never seen him before in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cENOUGH,\u201d the Alteran\u2019s voice booms across the garrison. In the corner of your eye, you see the tea party casually glance your way. \u201cYou two give me no choice.\u201d The soldier motions to a few others, who wander over. A group of them huddle together, deciding your fate. It seems they will collectively decide to lock you in the dungeon as none possess the rank to decide it by themselves. After a few moments of whispering and head nodding, your favorite Alteran soldier returns.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going in a place where you can\u2019t cause any more disruption. Your uncivilized behavior, the both of yours, means you\u2019re a danger to others. If you\u2019re going to behave like animals, you\u2019ll be locked up like animals.\u201d\n\nThen he says a few words that wipe the internal grin from your mind.\n\n\u201cThe hanging cages for you two.\u201d\n\nYour actions have gotten you locked up alright. Locked up in a single cage suspended from the top of the fort for all to see. The lock is not troubling. The constant supervision of a thousand soldiers, is. You doubt the artifact gives the ability to fight an entire battalion. The cage is irrelevant. But still, you\u2019re not going anywhere for a while.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hanging cage", "result": "They suspend you from the ramparts after the tea party finishes. Your cage, little more than the size of a coffin, is hung by a single chain. All in all, it\u2019s not a far drop to the ground. Meaning, if you get a moment to yourself, then the artifact could let you out, and broken legs wouldn\u2019t be waiting for you at the bottom. There\u2019s still a chance though. There always is. The drop, while not fatal, isn\u2019t exactly something you\u2019re looking forward to. It\u2019s probably been two hours since the \u201cfight.\u201d The doc ignores you with silent hatred, learning to hold off engaging with you. Since another incident likely has you hanging from a noose rather than in a cage, you understand. Alteran soldiers guard the ramparts above and patrol the ground below. Yep, this isn\u2019t exactly how you imagined things would go.\n\nThey stripped you of your armor and weapon sheaths, not noticing a lone black ring on your finger. They\u2019re soldiers after all, not scavs. The cage offers just enough space for you to sit with your knees pulled in tightly to your chest, as long as you don\u2019t mind steel digging into your back and toes. There\u2019s a decent breeze, one you never noticed being inside the garrison or in the overgrowth. Exposed in the air, however, it brings a chill, increasingly so, as the cage slowly drops in temperature.\n\nAny ideas, voice?\n(Yes, but I\u2019m more interested to see what you come up with.)\nLotta help you are.\n(More than you are. I\u2019d like to see you become a key.)\n\nTime passes as you try to think of possible solutions. If the Alterans were somehow distracted, then you could escape into the trees. Problem is, the only distraction you could cause would draw attention towards you rather than away.\n\nDo you have the ability to move on your own?\n(Apart from you? Not in this state.)\n\nAs you\u2019re thinking, a voice carries from below. It\u2019s one you recognize almost instantly, one that you hoped wouldn\u2019t notice your presence. \u201cYour deeds have finally caught up to you. Where\u2019s that traitor of a corporal?\u201d\n\nBastus. He looks better than when you saw him in the dungeon. More color appears to be in his skin, the difference a few hours of sunlight and stretching can do. But still, he\u2019s more frail than you\u2019re used to seeing.\n\n\u201cBastus\u2026\u201d you start, not sure what to say. There are no words to right the wrong in his mind. A betrayal, as sudden and unexpected as they come, is all he sees, deepened by years of shared battle and living. The bond forged between soldiers is not easily broken, yet when it is, it\u2019s damaged beyond all repair. A soldier must learn to deal with loss. There\u2019s no redemption for a liar. Cut ties and move on. You could tell him how your actions saved the life of the company. How you had no choice in the matter. That your actions brought about the greater good. Shit, now you\u2019re starting to sound like Redding.\n\n\u201cYou always did fancy yourself smarter than the rest of us, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Bastus starts. \u201cNot smart enough to trade uniforms for the losing team, though huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to understand, it was all to--\u201d\n\n\u201cAll to betray your company? Your friends? Your family? Redding was always an odd one. There\u2019s less of a surprise when an unconventional man makes an irrational decision. But you, you were supposed to be the opposite. It pains me to say so, but your death is well-deserved. You\u2019ve taught me--the entire company--a valuable lesson: you never truly know who your friends are.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no response to that. Shame builds inside, not because of events that occurred, but because you\u2019re unable to formulate thoughts and words to accurately convey your side of the story. A man that you\u2019ve lived closely with over the last few years thinks you are the most despicable of people, and you\u2019re unable to convince otherwise. Bastus\u2019 words hurt, a small sliver of what he probably felt seeing you in Magda crimson. For the greater good, you tell yourself. It\u2019s a burden that you have to bear, even if the company doesn\u2019t realize you\u2019re bearing it for them.\n\nBastus speaks again. \u201cI\u2019ll be there during your hanging. Though I won\u2019t be as joyful as the others.\u201d\n\nHe leaves you alone, his words hanging heavy on your heart. Not the most immediate problem, however. Redding still needs you. If there\u2019s any redemption to be had, it\u2019s in saving his life. The company thinks you a traitor. You are, technically, and it\u2019s that fact which keeps them still breathing.\n\nOne member of the company still needs your help. Let Bastus and the others think what they want; you can\u2019t control that. You only control your own actions. You\u2019ve made peace with them so far. After all you\u2019ve been through, the story can\u2019t end with Redding bleeding out, alone, and you facing the gallows. The possibility of a premature ending, a quiet death after the firestorm you\u2019ve endured, brings a tinge of rage within your bones. LIke that of your battle flow state, it comes, a persistence, the inability to quit while you still can act. True, your options are rather limited, but damn if you won\u2019t do something about it.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wait patiently", "result": "Time is short, yes. But acting too hastily would not only be condemning your fate, but Redding\u2019s as well. Yours are both aligned; the heart pumping in your chest might as well be pumping blood through his veins.

She\u2019s a cyclone upon the sea, going where she damn-well pleases, no matter the destruction left in her wake.\n\n\u201cAll makes sense now. No true Magdan would act like you.\u201d\n\nThe doc, listening to Bastus, seems to have put things together. Alexander\u2019s \u201ctwo friends\u201d weren\u2019t exactly meant to be secret. If anything, it was a strong inspirational message to kickstart praise for the Supreme Leader. If two Alterans decided the join the Supreme Leader, what can you do? Eerily similar to the posters placed on the billboard all those weeks ago before departing from Alteran. True creativity is hard to find. Most everything is imitation, colored and presented differently.\n\n\u201cGuilty as charged,\u201d you utter, not exactly in the mood to start a verbal debate with the man hanging next to you, which causes your next words to flow. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019ve received the same treatment. Surely, no true Magdan would act in such a way to find themselves here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, piss off,\u201d is the reply. So much for the argument.\n\nNo, there\u2019s nothing more to do than wait for an opportunity of escape. One that normally is low odds, lowest of the low, but the artifact changes everything. It\u2019s the winning card up your sleeve, the dagger (quite literally) in a fist fight. Now if there is just a way to remove the eyes that stare at your cage...\n\n---\n\nHours pass. You find yourself growing increasingly anxious watching the sun travel across the sky. You had a level of comfortability before, the knowledge of having minutes to spare; they grow smaller and smaller, the window of opportunity quickly closing upon itself. There\u2019s a small measure of reassurance in the fact that causing your own scene would likely bring a premature end.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just it. The end is here, premature or otherwise.\n\nIf you had known both paths led to death, perhaps your decisions would have been different. The thought causes a small laugh within your body, the kind that occurs during inappropriate times, a lecture hall, when being scolded, when faced with the most unfortunate of circumstances that somehow the only reaction is to laugh. All paths lead to death. Ha ha ha. Here, in the forest of the New World, what does it matter? In a few hours the problem will solve itself, and your anxiousness, dispelled.\n\nNot ten minutes later, your cage begins to lower in height, the way a sailor would loose an anchor. A steady grinding of steel sounds in the air, complemented with the cranking of a pulley-system. The ground approaches, not quickly. It\u2019s the same speed as a man, knowingly, eating his last dinner before facing the gallows: it might be the same for you, minus the meal. An Alteran soldier fumbles with the lock, before swinging the cage door open. A pair of hands pull you out, more clasp on your shoulders in warning as if to say escape is futile!\n\nThe voice is silent, perhaps in protest to your actions. You still feel its presence, however, the constant buzz of energy, which makes the silence even more impactful. It\u2019s letting you know of the power at your fingertips, yet denying you the use. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re dehydrated without coins in your pocket, staring through the window of an open tavern, its patrons spilling as many drinks on the ground as they manage to get down their throats.\n\nThe artifact that will \u201cturn the tide,\u201d isn\u2019t doing much turning currently. It might as well be a ring on your finger; at least in that case you could sell it for a sword (or a final meal). They march you right back up the switchback stairs to the top of the ramparts, where all traces of the previous tea party are gone. Captain Briggs stands, hands clasped behind his back. Bastus is next to him, and on the ground watching, you see Lionel and the rest of the company.\n\n\u201cI think you know why you\u2019re here,\u201d Captain Briggs states. His eyes narrow at you, the way a teacher would look at a disobedient student.\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d you say, looking at the hands on your shoulder.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuant. I\u2019m sure you understand what has to happen next?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d you repeat with more sincerity.\n\n\u201cAny last words?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a cliche question, but still, you find difficulty uncovering an answer. Last words. Whatever pours from your mouth will be the last, the words those in proximity will remember you by. Your life will be forgotten, a distant memory in others minds. Your thoughts, feelings, emotions--gone in an instant. Yet a remnant will remain, the areas in which those such things crossed, intertwined with others\u2019 thoughts, feelings, and emotions, not to mention experiences. Experiences like this one, the hanging of a man, noose tied around his throat. What you say now will echo long after you stop breathing, live on further than you.\n\nThe same goes for your actions. Briefly, you entertain fighting your way out. To what purpose? That would be undoing all that you\u2019ve done. The reason for going along with Redding\u2019s plan in the first place was to preserve the life of the company, of your fellow Alterans. And what now? You\u2019re thinking about killing Alterans to preserve your life, and that\u2019s assuming you can cut your way through a thousand men. No. The decision\u2019s already been made. You\u2019re already a turncoat in their mind. Better to die a turncoat than a turncoat and murderer.\n\nAs you\u2019re thinking, they place a noose over your head. It rests on your shoulders for a moment before getting cinched tight. It\u2019s a lot heavier than you expected, tightly-bound rope. That\u2019s something you never hear, though to be fair the people actually having such thoughts rarely have another chance to voice it. And suddenly you have it, the words to speak, ones that have gone unspoken. You\u2019ll be the first. You\u2019ll not result to begging, pleading to save your life.\n\nAll paths lead here. All decisions lead to death.\n\nExpecting a speech, you\u2019re a bit surprised how quiet it is. Standing at the top of the ramparts, again, you notice details that you didn't before. The gentle breeze upon your skin, the gentle sway of tree leaves signaling that the forest is experiencing the same. The nervous way in which men glance, unsure of themselves, a few such men stare at your boots rather than in your eyes. You wonder what they\u2019re thinking, if they\u2019re putting themselves in your place, pondering the final moments of their life and the final words they\u2019ll speak. Lastly, the quiet itself. It\u2019s nothing like the bustling cities of Alteran, overcrowded streets and population. The New World, yet as dangerous as they come, is somehow at peace with herself. It\u2019s not even the calm before the storm; it simply is to her nature, both peaceful and dangerous.\n\n\u201cThey never tell you how heavy these things are,\u201d you state, thinking of the noose, but then noticing how it applies to the execution itself.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Bastus says. \u201cYou won\u2019t carry the burden for much longer.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. Over the edge of the ramparts, you\u2019re falling. Then, silence, save for the steady sway of your body in the wind.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Break out", "result": "Time is short. Too short. If the noose waits for you, certain death, then you\u2019re not going to sit and wait for the rope to be placed around your neck. There is a time to act, and there is a time to bide your time. Redding\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t afford you any more slack. The time is now. You will the artifact to mould to the shape. It\u2019s not exactly a command; it\u2019s something different, like recalling a memory, the subsiding of a dream when awakening in the morning.\n\nIn order to mask the maneuver, you stretch your arms out, feigning like stiff shoulders are starting to wear on you. Both hands grip the cage, which is oddly just an oversized cage for a bird. Or rather, it\u2019s a Blackbird cage. Disobedient soldiers get thrown in the dungeon, the same goes for prisoners of war. True enemies get the cage, a status you find yourself in currently. Click. You unlock the cage door, but don\u2019t escape just yet. Let it come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cI saw that.\u201d Now the doc is speaking to you. \u201cWhat the hell kind of sorcerer are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne that means not to die imprisoned,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cAnd if I cause a commotion and ruin your escape? I\u2019m only here because of you.\u201d\n\nA Redding-esque grin appears at your lips. \u201cA commotion is exactly what I want from you.\u201d\n\nBefore the doc can respond, you will the artifact into the strange gun, ravenblack, wing-tipped with the rotating cylinder.\n\nHow many shots, again?\n(Six. Then nearly as many seconds to recover.)\n\nYou put the first of six into the chain holding the doc\u2019s cage. For the second time today, he has no idea of the sudden events transpiring, both of which are very unfortunate for the man lucky enough to draw your attention. His mouth is wide open, the same for his eyes. Wide in surprise, horror--perhaps a mixture of the two. Both of his hands grip the cage, tight, like the way a sailor climbs the mast for the first time. One moment he\u2019s suspended next to you. The next, empty air.\n\nThe sound is like a galleon discovering a coral reef with her underbelly. Every Alteran soldier within sight rushes towards the fallen cage, whether to check on the doc\u2019s well-being or integrity of the cage is up for debate. Just what you need. You take the chance to slowly open the cage door so as not to cause a sudden squeak. You climb to the top, using all four limbs the way a squirrel or similar forest creature would scamper up a tree. Before heading up the chain, your foot deftly nudges the door back to its position. You\u2019re more likely to be seen if the cage door is wide open.\n\nYou straddle the chain, hugging your body close. You\u2019ll likely be facing more than a few men in combat, and so you disperse the energy expenditure throughout your entire body rather than gassing out your arms. Men shout. They rush down from the ramparts towards the collapsed cage, leaving the top of the wall mostly unguarded. Mostly.\n\nSwinging your legs over the side, two Alterans examining the chain's anchor look up as soon as your feet hit the ground. Two Alterans, your countrymen, your fellow soldiers. Can you even claim that? Well, you don\u2019t have time to think through your status thoroughly. All you see is two men who will throw you back inside of a cage, and likely stand outside eyeing you the entire time.\n\nBlack smoke. Small thunderclouds. A wing-tipped club smashes into two skulls.\n\nA few missing teeth in exchange for many more years of life? You\u2019re doing them a favor, even if they\u2019ll need to eat mush for the next month or two. You abandon the Magda tunic and replace it with one of the Alteran\u2019s navy overcoat. It\u2019s not a perfect fit. Little loose around the torso. Better than nothing, and you\u2019ll have the ability to blend in with the now-Alteran fort with ease. You understand it\u2019s not as simple as walking out the front gate. Not when there is a gathering crowd of soldiers checking on the fallen cage.\n\nYour best bet is through the dungeon tunnel. But first, you\u2019ll need to pilfer supplies. You might not be able to bring an actual field surgeon, but you\u2019ll settle for the tools of one. In all your battlefield experience, you\u2019ve never had to do more than wrapping a tourniquet or one or two cauterizations. Redding needs to be stitched. With a surgeon\u2019s needle and thread, you\u2019ll have to do your best. Hopefully there\u2019s a bottle of brandy lying around for anesthetic. You could use some yourself after the day you\u2019re having, although it\u2019s not nearly as bad as the day the doc is having.\n\nOn the ramparts, you eye a few wooden crates. They\u2019re mostly empty, no more than two feet across. Whatever contents they carried has long been emptied and put to use. Waste not. You shut one of the crates, sliding a wooden panel on its designated track. It\u2019s empty, but the passing Alteran won\u2019t know it. As far as they know, you\u2019ve been tasked with delivering the crate...somewhere. Chain of command, the High King loves it. It also means those directly in your chain won\u2019t step out of line to question you. Thank you, High King.\n\nCrate in hand, you know exactly where you\u2019re going. You may not know where the medical center is, but you know where all the supplies are kept: the quartermaster\u2019s office. It\u2019ll be run by an Alteran now, but everything you need will be there. You put on your best blank face and make your way there, treating it as if it\u2019s your very duty. It is, in a sense, but not like the soldier\u2019s will assume, which is fine with you. Along the way, you give a few nods to those who make eye contact. It\u2019s unspoken, yet those wearing the same rank give their version of a sympathetic look. Running cargo isn\u2019t the most glorious of positions, especially after taking over the fort of the High King\u2019s greatest rival. It\u2019s not exactly the glory-filled task to write home about.\n\nStanding in place of the Magda quartermaster, is a shrewd-looking Alteran, the type of person that always assumes whoever\u2019s talking to them is lying, complete with over-compensating eye contact and distrust towards newcomers.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t order any more uniforms,\u201d he states as you enter. \u201cThat\u2019s what I assume those are, are they not?\u201d\n\nYou glance down. Sure enough, there\u2019s a small marking on the crate identifying its previous contents. Coats. It holds the insignia of the High King, so the battalion must have packed extra for their invasion. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you ordered or not. I just do as I am.\u201d\n\nThe now-Alteran quartermaster\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cAs you are...oh, ordered.\u201d He sighs. \u201cPlace them in the back, near the far wall. The former \u2018proprietor\u2019 was very loose with his cataloguing. It\u2019s a mess. Luckily, those awful crimson tunics can be burned along with any flags or banners.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere?\u201d you say, placing down the crate.\n\n\u201cNo! Not there. There.\u201d The quartermaster points pretty close to where you are already.\n\n\u201cHere?\u201d you say again, moving the crate slightly.\n\n\u201cNo! Half-wit,\u201d he utters under his breath, although it\u2019s not as subtle as perhaps he intended. He sighs. \u201cMust I do everything myself?\u201d\n\nThe quartermaster takes the crate with both hands, bracing himself to lift a heavy object. When he picks it up with little struggle, a laugh almost escapes your lips. It\u2019s similar to the way a tug-of-rope opponent may release tension on the rope, sending the other sprawling backwards. The quartermaster stumbles, gathering himself.\n\n\u201cHere?\u201d you say for a third time, not before landing a fist squarely on the quartermaster\u2019s jaw. Lights out. Out cold. No time to tarry. You enter the stockroom, scanning down aisles of equipment. Swords, bucklers, armor, uniforms, boots, and finally, medical equipment. There are bundled cloth, different types of knives and cutting tools, bone saws included. You snatch a needle and thread along with a bottle that smells like spoiled wine mixed with drops of brandy.\n\nAs you\u2019re about to leave, you catch men\u2019s shouts and stomping of boots. You know exactly why: a certain cage must have been discovered to be empty. That, and perhaps two soldiers were discovered taking a nap on the ramparts, one of whom is missing a coat. Took them long enough. The good news is that you know protocol. Each company will be instructed into formation. Any stragglers, men wandering on their own will be detained. The bad news, of course, is that you aren\u2019t assigned to a company, and even if you took place in one, it\u2019s a small enough group that you\u2019d be noticed as an imposter. For the second time, you\u2019re faced not with a locked door or looking the part of Alteran soldier, but instead, your problem is concerned with the placement of one\u2019s self, exposed, alone. Hard to blend in when there\u2019s no one to blend in with.\n\nIf your stay in the quartermaster\u2019s office will be longer than expected, and it seems that way, you might as well get comfortable. You tie the sleeping quartermaster up in the stockroom with rope that he\u2019s accountable for, notably not logging it in the books. The white strips of bandage cloth make for a decent gag as well. The artifact and you, back to a gun in your palm, crouch near the door to listen outside and ambush any soldier that would wander inside.\n\nThrough the small windows, the street outside becomes filled with navy blue. The formation takes place in rows down the main walkway. Protocol says they will be directed down towards the main gate, which is where a thorough examination will take place. Once all the blues are verified, then an in-depth sweep will take place, meaning you\u2019ll need to be long gone by that time. The ordeal will take nearly two hours, you estimate. There\u2019s a thousand soldiers to count, after all. Man by man. The entrance to the fort\u2019s dungeon isn\u2019t too far away. There\u2019s the small matter of getting there unseen.\n\nGot any more surprises that may help?\n(Surprises, yes. Helpful? Maybe not so much.)\n\nA sudden feeling of helplessness falls over you, though you\u2019d care to not admit it. Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. Stay put, and Redding bleeds out. Make for the dungeon, or any place other than the office, and you get cut down in the street. All outcomes seem to point towards death, a sentiment that can be applied towards any point in your life. No matter what you do, death will come. At least you have the choice to decide how you may greet it. And who knows, maybe you\u2019ll be able to slam the door in death\u2019s face.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay put", "result": "Walking outside means certain death. No question about that. Getting yourself killed is condemning Redding to the same fate. You must wait for the opportune moment. You briefly entertain playing the clueless soldier tasked with transport again. Surely it couldn\u2019t work now, right? You don\u2019t want to risk it. One mistake, and you\u2019re done, the both of you. Time passes. More footsteps echo from outside. They grow softer.\n\nYou glance outside again. There\u2019s still a large amount of soldiers in formation, but the majority seem to be near the gate. Despite the smaller number, it\u2019s still too many to risk leaving the quartermaster\u2019s office. Might as well get comfortable. You\u2019re not completely out of time for Redding yet. He\u2019s in decently-good shape. The retreat from the Blackbird war party proved that. The problem is you don\u2019t know his condition on the inside, whether the spear tore into a vital organ. Likely not, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the man\u2019s card playing face fooled you.\n\nSuddenly, footsteps.\n\nNot in unison, marching away from your location as the soldiers lining the streets. But irregular, with a purpose, growing in volume. If they decide to visit the quartermaster for supplies they\u2019ll be in for a wing-tipped surprise. The artifact becomes a dagger in your hand, just as you found it. Full circle, like you throwing on the Alteran coat. Louder and louder they become, like a wave slowly building before the crash. And crash, they do.\n\nThe front door to the office swings open. You\u2019re hidden from view, ready to flank the newcomers as soon as they step foot inside. You dare not breathe heavily for fear of being heard. Instead your breath becomes slow, deliberate. Your body screams at you to act, to release the building tension. Yet you wait for all, sounds like three pairs of boots, to enter. It\u2019s actually four.\n\nFour navy coats enter into the office. \u201cQuartermaster!\u201d one of them, you\u2019re not certain who shouts towards the stock room. If they were to wander in, they\u2019d find the man bound and gagged. With the fort on high alert, silence from the quartermaster isn\u2019t a good sign either. You don\u2019t give them the chance to discover him.\n\nYou creep forward, dagger in hand, crouched as to absorb the weight of your steps through your legs. His back is turned, a long sweeping overcoat, navy blue, just as the High King commissioned. You dye it the same color as the Magda tunic. Back turned, the Alteran doesn\u2019t have time to react. In fact, you don\u2019t even have time to think about killing a fellow Alteran, someone who journeyed with you from the Old World into the New, experienced the landing and march to Frontrunner\u2019s. Two men on the ramparts didn\u2019t bother you; they could be disposed with less-than-fatal means. But four. Four is a different story. It\u2019s either me or you, and you know who wins every time.\n\nOne drops, drawing the attention of the others. It was unrealistic to quietly take out one without alerting the others. You see that now. Even without a floorboard creaking, a hand covering a mouth, there are still audible signs--as muffled as they may be. Three heads turn in your direction. Thunderclouds. Smoke. The dagger becomes a longsword. You take the offensive, meaning to put an end to things before they can officially begin. The ravenblack blade tears through flesh. The next soldier drops before managing to draw his own sword. The other two, however, meet your attack with equal ferocity, propelled by the sudden death of their two companions.\n\nThey\u2019re good. Better than most. The instructors in the Alteran military are truly the greatest in the world. Unfortunately for your opponents, you, also, have instruction from the greatest, and you took to it more than most. The ravenblack blade becomes a dark blur, not letting the Alterans time to counter with their own attacks, else they risk one of your swings landing true. The artifact in both hands, you feel the tide turning in your favor, just like Redding foresaw. Redding! The thought of the man fuels your attacks, finding openings in both man\u2019s defenses. Four Alterans walked in, four lie bleeding on the wooden floors.\n\n\u201cThere he is! Quartermaster\u2019s office!\u201d\n\nA shout rings from outside. Through the still open front door, you\u2019ve managed to draw the attention of every soldier in formation outside. Rather than a stoic demeanor, eyes and head straight forward, all gaze towards the open door, towards you. A split-second later, they break formation. In less time, you make for the back. There\u2019s got to be a back door, second entrance. Hell, you\u2019d settle for a small window at this point.\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing. It\u2019s essentially a warehouse, a building designed for stocking large amounts of material, not needing sunlight or second entrances, which only make for alternative solutions for thieves to break in...or murderers, traitors to escape capture. You run down the aisles anyway, desperate for anything. All that greets you is rows and rows of equipment, along with one smug looking quartermaster, despite his current state. You can feel his eyes upon you, likely knowing the curses that would flow from his mouth should you remove the gag.\n\nFootsteps grow louder. They\u2019re nothing like before. Four men first approached. Now, there\u2019s hundreds. They can\u2019t all fit into the office, but enough can, enough that will eventually overwhelm you, artifact or no. A sinking feeling starts in the pit of your stomach. You\u2019ve been faced with perilous, hopeless situations before, some since arriving to the New World. This feels different, like saying goodbye to a friend you won\u2019t see again. More footsteps. The smile underneath the quartermaster\u2019s gag is almost palpable.\n\nSoldiers pour into the stockroom like a water pump with a broken valve. There\u2019s no going back. Many pour through the opening , many you will put down before joining them. That\u2019s all you can do. The voice is silent, perhaps in protest to your decisions. It\u2019s not the ending you wished for, hoped for. But it\u2019s the one you receive now.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Make for the dungeon", "result": "It\u2019s not the best of plans, but it\u2019s a plan nonetheless. How many times have you been told the artifact will turn the tide of the war? Feels like at least a dozen, although you know that might be an exaggeration. It may not be war on a grand-scale, but it might as well be for you, grand, the climax of your life as a soldier, first starting in the Old and traveling to the New World.\n\n(Suddenly, I\u2019m regretting the decision to bond with you.)\nShut up. No you\u2019re not.\n(Fine. Let \u2018the artifact\u2019 fall into the hands of another.)\nIt\u2019ll be a simple dagger, like Redding possessed. Pick another after I\u2019m gone. I don\u2019t care.\n(So this is it then. Shame.)\nBlaze of glory.\n\nBut still, you don\u2019t have to lead with fireworks. It\u2019s served you before, might as well try it again. You creep towards the stockroom and look for equipment that will suit your needs. Weapons, no. Armor--actually, yes. Finding leather that fits, you strap it to your body underneath the Alteran coat. You\u2019re heading towards the dungeon, so you decide to gather equipment that a jailor may require. Shackles, chained about four feet in length is what you set your eyes on. Heavy, sure, but topical. And it\u2019s not like you need mobility, at least not without the ability to drop the shackles first. It\u2019s a plan nonetheless.\n\nWith two chains over each shoulder, you exit the quartermaster\u2019s office. Almost instantly, you feel all eyes draw to you. It\u2019s only eyes, not heads. It wouldn\u2019t be proper formation if soldiers turned their heads at a simple motion in the corner of their vision. You pretend not to notice them, heading straight for the dungeon, not too quickly, but just enough urgency to signal that the shackles are needed sooner rather than later. You make it halfway before a voice calls out, much farther than you first expected.\n\n\u201cStop! All are to report to their immediate commanding officer.\u201d It\u2019s a lieutenant by the sound. Not too much authority, but just enough to flaunt it. You turn and find your suspicion is correct. Of course the lieutenant's head and face are shaved perfectly to military preference.\n\nYou gesture at a shoulder with your chin. \u201cI was told to run these to the dungeon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who exactly told you to do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the quartermaster, of course. He seemed reluctant to depart with these, if you ask me. But orders are orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one asked you,\u201d the lieutenant quickly says. \u201cCompany?\u201d You give the name of another that journeyed from Alteran in the fleet, not that you actually met them before. \u201cCompany leader?\u201d You give the answer, Corporal Nueman. The lieutenant ponders a moment before saying, \u201cAll right then. Be quick about it. There\u2019s an imposter among our midst.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice...sir,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cOh and one last thing, soldier.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d you ask as you\u2019re about to take another step towards the dungeon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Corporal Nueman. Well, previously. It\u2019s Lieutenant now.\u201d\n\nShit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found the imposter! Take him!\u201d\n\nBlaze of glory time. Two soldiers on the ramparts received the non-fatal approach from you. Surrounded, in the midst of hundreds of soldiers, you can\u2019t afford such limitations. You\u2019ll likely be hung anyway, so it\u2019s not like offing a few soldiers will worsen your fate. Before you can give another thought to killing men that you\u2019ve gone into battle with, instinct takes over. It overrides any sort of rational thought beyond the present moment. It\u2019ll be another weight on your conscience later. That is, if you still have breath at the end of the day.\n\n(Ha ha! Let\u2019s play. Step right up. Who wants to dance? I've got enough for everyone. Comere, you. Ha ha!)\n\nThe voice, gone is the curious, questioning mind that you\u2019ve dialogued with. Instead, you hear the fragmented thoughts of a broken mind, pieced poorly together. Yet another problem for another time. Seems to be a lot of that running around lately. All you can do now is focus on surviving. The rest is secondary.\n\nSix shots fire from the pistol almost immediately, six bodies dropping in the same amount of time. Internally you count. One, two\u2026 Swords draw in front of you, the same happening at your back. Can you? (Yes!) The artifact is back into a longsword in your palm, black smoke clears in front of you, fading into clear air. Three, four. Its recovery is due to the bullets then, not the shape of the weapon. Beyond it, you can see the confusion on the soldiers\u2019 faces, the artifact\u2019s power appearing to bypass their strict discipline, along with a pistol that fires six times, instead of the standard issue double barrelled flintlock.\n\nThey meet your charge. It\u2019s you who has to keep moving. You\u2019ll need to engage and disengage quickly. If you can make it to the dungeon, you give yourself good odds. Down a tunnel their numbers will mean nothing, especially if you possess a weapon with superior range, ammunition, and accuracy. Yes, if they follow you to the secret tunnel, then you\u2019ll close their end with a pile of bodies. If you get there in one piece.\n\nSteel clashes against the ravenblack blade. It doesn\u2019t ring the same way as steel. It\u2019s a duller sound, more dense, the difference between knocking on a wall stud or empty wall. There\u2019s no sense in trying to be defensive. That\u2019d be delaying the inevitable. Your only hope is to cut a path through. Like the forest of the New World, a trail must be forged by your own doing. Instead of overgrowth, living men stand in your way.\n\nYou do as you are trained to do. You lose yourself to the moment. It doesn\u2019t fail to arrive during battle, the flow state, as if another takes the reins of your mind; you\u2019re simply a spectator along the way, like the flashbacks of your past, like a dreamer while asleep. The black blade sweeps through the air in a blur in motion. It doesn\u2019t flash in the sun. It doesn\u2019t ring like steel. It\u2019s something else. Sinister. Powerful. Chipping shards of steel from Alteran sword edges, absorbing each blow without a shock to your arms. Once you have ample space--small thunderclouds, smoke. Six shots. Then the longsword appears again.\n\nYou sweep through the Alteran formations, not taking direct confrontation with any one soldier. They\u2019re either quickly disposed of, or you move on to the next. After two full rounds of shots, they must understand the limitation of the gun, yet they don\u2019t swarm once the longsword appears, seemingly hesitant as if a step forward would result in the six-shooter\u2019s appearance. Finally, you make it to the door to the dungeon.\n\nAs if protesting your sudden arrival, two flintlock shots land near the door frame, one on each side. The shots may not exactly be in protest, but the jailer behind them sure is, especially once the clean shot is missed not once, but twice. You don\u2019t recognize the man, but in your state it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. They aren\u2019t your countrymen right now. They aren\u2019t your fellow soldiers--still something to address later. They\u2019re obstacles in your way. The black longsword cuts the jailer\u2019s flintlock into two pieces right down the center, splitting the double barrel into two singles. The jailer holding the weapon receives a similar treatment shortly after, from shoulder to crotch.\n\nYou don\u2019t bother searching his belt for keys. Footsteps behind you. The tunnel lies ahead. Redding\u2019s time is short.", "action_results": [{"action": "Redding", "result": "They attempt to follow you into the tunnel. Quickly, they learn it\u2019s certain death. The artifact fires true from your palm, its bullets always straight. Black smoke fills the tunnel, traveling towards the dungeon cell, the air closest. Bodies pile up. To stick one\u2019s nose in the tunnel, even for a quick glance, is to risk losing the nose, an eye, or worse. Their numbers mean nothing here, and no one knows where the tunnel exits. None but Alexander, Prinn, and perhaps a few other key Magda members who aren\u2019t the ones after you. Freedom is yours. Now you\u2019ll just have to stitch Redding up in time without making the wound worse, although death is guaranteed if you don\u2019t try, so there\u2019s some small measure of reassurance there.\n\nYou can\u2019t believe you made it. Into a fort blown to bits, occupied by the very army that labels you a traitor, escaping a prison suspended in the air, fighting your way through rows and rows of soldiers in formation, all while finding a surgeon\u2019s needle and thread to save your friend and mentor. It\u2019s almost too good to be true. Redding\u2019s ever-contagious grin creeps along the corner of your lips, becoming more of a natural occurrence. It\u2019s true what they say, taking on the mannerisms of those you\u2019re close to. There are far worse traits to take on.\n\n(Is the action over already? I was just getting started!)\nFor now.\n(Awww.)\n\nYou press on. The footsteps and voices of the Alteran soldiers in pursuit have long faded away, bringing the only sounds in the tunnel of your own making. You\u2019re not exactly hiding your presence--who would hear your approach in an enclosed space--but you have the mindset of a fugitive, of a criminal breaking out of prison, which, funnily-enough, is exactly what you\u2019re doing, counting two escaped locked doors: the suspended cage and the dungeon itself. You try not to dwell on the sudden character shift of the artifact. It can sense your thoughts, which you\u2019d rather remain a secret. One problem at a time. They seem to be piling up by the second, but a single one remains at the top of the list. Redding.\n\nA soft amount of light suddenly appears. You\u2019re briefly entertained, inappropriately, by reaching the light at the end of the tunnel before remembering why you\u2019re here in the first place. Although to be fair, it\u2019s something that would have entertained Redding too. Will entertain him, you remind yourself. Your pace quickens now, careful not to scrape your head on the tunnel\u2019s ceiling. Your head finding a jutting stone at nearly a run isn\u2019t the ending that this story deserves. At least you procured a needle and thread to stitch yourself up if that\u2019s what fate decides. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t take the bait, and you manage to reach the light at the end of the tunnel, where the small hidden door lies. Redding should be right here...except he\u2019s not.\n\nThe place where you left him is completely empty. There are small marks in the dirt where he sat. You need more light to inspect, so you crack the hidden door open for more natural light to spill through. Imprints on the dirt all right, smooth sections where his legs sat on the dirt, in contrast to the random arrangement of dust and dirt. You\u2019re no tracker. You can\u2019t judge the time frame, whether or not multiple bodies were here. If anything, you\u2019d confuse your earlier marks and bootprints with an unknown assailant. Well, there\u2019s one thing you know for certain. You just traveled down the other opening of the tunnel and didn\u2019t run into Redding. There\u2019s only one other direction he could have gone. Out the hidden door (the light at the end of the tunnel).\n\nOnce again you find yourself back at the creek for the third time. There, your lack of tracking ability is nullified. Redding is bound at the hands. A long trail of rope leads to his captor like a leash. Holding the opposite end of the rope, binding Redding to his fate is Prinn. He casually glances over his shoulder, noticing your appearance. He likely heard you long before exiting the tunnel, such are the skills of a woodsman, a scoutleader no less.\n\n\u201cI was wondering when you would show up,\u201d he comments, eyes focused on an object in his hands. His green cloak hides the object. Speaking of green cloaks, you don\u2019t see the others, but that does not mean that they don\u2019t see you. There are fourteen of them, something you mentally note in case things turn ugly.\n\n(Yeah! Turn them ugly, ugly.)\n\n\u201cHe needs medical attention,\u201d you start, pulling the needle and thread from your pocket. As you rush towards the two, you catch sight of Redding\u2019s wound, taken care of by Prinn. First aid, another skill set required of a woodsman.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, that\u2019s already taken care of,\u201d Prinn says in the manner of one swatting a fly from his dinner.\n\n\u201cI can also see his hands are bound.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perceptive of you.\u201d The dig gives you a flashback to your childhood and the boy who couldn\u2019t help but hurl insults every chance he got. The adult in front of you is the furthest thing from the good-humored boy, despite the brief similarity in mannerism.\n\n\u201cAnd why are they bound?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you tell, kid?\u201d Redding manges to say. You notice small sights of bruising appearing on his face. The freedom-speaking, government-abolishing Redding apparently didn\u2019t take the bindings without a struggle. There probably wasn\u2019t much of one in his condition. \u201cThe garrison fell, did it not?\u201d\n\nAt this, both men turn to look at you. The lack of surprise on your face is telling enough. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\nPrinn says, \u201cWe lost track of the Blackbirds. They cover their tracks well. We\u2019ll find their war camp. You can bet on that. After we lost the trail...\u201d\n\n\u201c...then you returned back to the garrison,\u201d you finish.\n\n\u201cExactly. And discovered a thousand Alteran soldiers in occupation, the white flag and surrender hosting taking place. The true surprise came when I started to sneak back into the garrison through the tunnel.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what next?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cThat depends,\u201d Prinn answers. \u201cWhat are the Alteran\u2019s plans?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no point in withholding information. Besides, informing a Magda scoutleader is technically keeping alliances. \u201cThe garrison\u2019s getting sent back to Magda. I\u2019m uncertain when, but the men will be spared as long as they return to the Old World and never voyage back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a traditional term of surrender during colonization,\u201d Prinn comments. You\u2019re already well-aware of that fact. \u201cBut the rules are different here. There is a common enemy within the trees of the forest. Magda and Alteran should not be squabbling together while a war party threatens our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds good and all, but there\u2019s no convincing the commanding officers,\u201d you say, feeling Redding\u2019s gaze of approval. Might as well keep going. \u201cThey\u2019re only concerned with beating their leader\u2019s rival in the New World and gaining credibility and climbing rank. The Blackbirds are an afterthought, a nuisance.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and I both know they\u2019re more than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo argument here. I\u2019m not the one who needs to be convinced though.\u201d\n\nPrinn scratches his chin in thought. \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\n\nHmm.\n\nThe blond-headed boy scratches his chin in thought, feeling at imaginary whiskers. You both stand before Vladimir, your father\u2019s man, his enforcer. For the first time you see the man clearly, noticing detail. Before, he was simply part of the background, like a horse carriage passing by in the street, a butler in a wealthy manor. His overcoat is of good quality brown thread, reaching nearly to his boots. Underneath is a pure white tunic, open at the top exposing a few chest hairs trying to escape. At his hip rests a long rapier, its handle intricately weaved of intertwining metal. Vladimir\u2019s expression is firm. Fixed. Hardened. Some men see only the physical. Others, like Vladimir, see into the soul.\n\n\u201cDo you know where you went wrong?\u201d Vladimir asks.\n\nIt\u2019s been a full week since the events with Kelle and his goons. Prinn didn\u2019t speak to you for the first half. It took a few days from there to get him to his normal self. Normal self. There is something different about him now. It\u2019s the difference after witnessing the gallows for the first time or surviving your first battlefield. The naive way of thinking, the one a child views reality through, is gone, replaced with a sense of the ugliness of life and the people who possess it. And he has you to thank for it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think through the plan well enough,\u201d you answer, child-sized hands clasped behind your back playing soldier.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Prinn interjects. \u201cWe didn\u2019t plan thoroughly enough.\u201d\n\nVladimir nods, finding the answer that he\u2019s looking for. \u201cFixed on revenge, you didn\u2019t account for what happens after it was achieved. So focused on getting back at Kelle that you allowed him to return fire. Revenge. Ambush. When you take your enemy down, be sure that he can\u2019t rise up again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t make that mistake again,\u201d you reply, again taking the fault on your own shoulders. Is that what you\u2019re really doing though? Or are you planning to leave Prinn behind on your next attack? Of course your singular speech draws Prinn\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that what you want, then? To try again with Kelle?\u201d Vladimir questions.\n\nBoth of you answer with an emphatic \u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may find that revenge doesn\u2019t solve your problems. If there are things you seek to bury, revenge won\u2019t keep them underground.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a long-term fix,\u201d Prinn admits. \u201cBut it\u2019s a hell of a field tourniquet.\u201d\n\nUpon his answer, Vladimir rolls back his head in laughter, the same kind that you\u2019d expect at a busy tavern. \u201cHa ha ha. Alright then, young masters. Remember,\u201d he grows serious, stern, rather quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t let any further disgrace fall on your father\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. \u2018Don't embarrass your father. Don\u2019t let anything stain his good name.\u2019 I know, I know.\u201d you answer.\n\nYour untrained eyes don\u2019t register the movement until it\u2019s too late. One moment Vladimir is leaning against the desk in his study, the next he\u2019s crouching over your fallen body, knee putting pressure on your chest pinning you in place. Prinn knows better than to help. You can see it in his face. You made the bed; now you gotta lie in it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s not a game,\u201d Vladimir breathes fire. \u201cI\u2019m allowing this to happen only because Kelle needs to learn what crossing your family means. You won\u2019t follow in your father\u2019s political footsteps, that much is clear. There\u2019s still hope for you, however, as an enforcer for your sister. Crossing your family means grave consequences. Better to have Kelle learn that at a young age.\u201d\n\nVladimir\u2019s head turns towards Prinn. \u201cYou. You\u2019re the smart one here. Make sure our young master doesn\u2019t do anything that will fall back on his father\u2019s name, ok?\u201d Prinn nods.\n\nFootsteps. The door to the study swings open without a single creak or settle, the only sound being the doorknob and gust of wind. Vladimir likes to keep his business well-oiled and practical. It\u2019s your sister. She\u2019s dressed in the robes of the school, marks on her arm signaling top rank in class. Your eyes meet for a split-second before she focuses solely on Vladimir.\n\n\u201cFather needs you. There\u2019s a...difficult client.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come now,\u201d Vladimir answers, removing his knee from your chest. He points a finger in your direction and again, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t let any further disgrace fall on your father\u2019s name.\u201d With that, he leaves you and Prinn alone in his study. He doesn\u2019t warn against disturbing the place, messing with his desk and books like a normal adult would when leaving two children on their own. His possessions, and life, are owned by your father and by extension, you, despite your lack of authority in that regard. Your sister, however, doesn\u2019t seem to mind giving orders. Then again, she\u2019ll likely be the one taking over your father\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Prinn says, offering a hand. \u201cAnything comes to mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cA plan is starting to emerge\u201d you answer. \u201cOne fully thought through.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean thorough?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d\n\n---\n\nMaster Gavin\u2019s lecture is running late. Odd for one as punctual as the teacher usually is. Must be on a roll, you think to yourself. He doesn\u2019t like to stop the flow, even when going over time. You and Prinn wait outside in the hallway. The lecture hall is built from deep chestnut, shined and dusted to perfection. Crown molding lines the ceiling and floors. A few sculptures, faces carved reflecting previous teachers fill the opposite end of the room. Master Gavin likely aims to have his own sculpture one day, his academic career displayed in timeless stone.\n\nThe two of you wait outside. In a few moments students will pour from the lecture hall, Kelle being one of them. You\u2019ve rehearsed the plan beforehand. You failed in physical altercation. Prinn is a liability in that regard. In verbal, however, you might just make a fool of Kelle in front of the other classmates, witnesses who will spread the tale and ensure Kelle doesn\u2019t resort back to physical means.\n\nSuddenly, the double doors to the lecture hall burst open. Students pour through like a hole in a dam, ready to leave the lecture hall as they\u2019re long overdue. They pass by you like water around two river stones. Then you see him. Kelle, without his two goons, surprisingly, not that they\u2019d be able to help him out in something like you\u2019re about to start. His eyes fix on you immediately, and a grin stretches across his face, no doubt remembering your previous encounter.\n\n\u201cThe runt and his braindead friend. Haven\u2019t flunked out, have you?\u201d\n\nHis adversarial words gather the attention of the other students. You notice they move slower now, listening to the conversation, but trying not to make it obvious.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d you answer. \u201cI was actually hoping you\u2019d be able to help me out in that regard.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Help you? You can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Kelle answers.\n\n\u201cQuite serious,\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that you\u2019re the smartest one in our class, even if you manage to perform poorly on your exams.\u201d\n\nAs you were hoping, the backhanded compliment rings as an insult in Kelle\u2019s ears, yet they could be considered friendly to the passerbyers.\n\n\u201cI perform better than you,\u201d Kelle replies. His face appears to be turning a shade of red. He, too, notices the others watching.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d you say to Prinn, emphasising your words by knocking on his shoulder lightly. \u201cI told you he was smart. It\u2019s surprising that you\u2019re top rank, not Kelle.\u201d Around you, you hear a snicker from a few students. Good. Let them make their presence even more known to Kelle. He\u2019s a limit tester. Hit him once, he\u2019ll hit twice back. Dump an old chamber pot on him, and he\u2019ll piss on your face.\n\n\u201cYou better watch yourselves,\u201d Kelle warns. You notice his hands are clenched into fists now. \u201cI hear someone\u2019s been stealing chamber pots and I\u2019ve drank a lot of water today.\u201d\n\nAt that, the other students appear confused as, unlike Prinn and yourself, they have no idea what Kelle is referencing. If anything, it\u2019s a crude joke, base humor. Not something that an upstanding family should ever utter. You hoped he\u2019d bring it up. You lean into it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fortunate thing for you. Rumor is that your performance anxiety translates to standing over an empty pot too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut not to your friend\u2019s face it would seem.\u201d Kelle\u2019s grin widens, his mind reverting back to the moment he sprayed Prinn\u2019s head with shame and dominance.\n\nThat is what you are going for, the line obviously being crossed, persuaded by insults and the memory of taking shit and piss raining from above. The other kids don\u2019t know it and will obviously take your side, rumors are likely already spreading from those who are exiting the hall already. Don\u2019t bring dishonor on your father, Vladimir said. Kelle, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t warned the way you were. Kelle thinks he\u2019s won because of your previous fight. He\u2019s losing the fight now with the crowd. In a place of politics and social standing and family honor, he\u2019s committed the gravest of mistakes: losing the people.\n\n\u201cI withdraw my request,\u201d you say to Kelle. \u201cClearly, I\u2019m better off finding a tutor who doesn\u2019t revert to base humor and threats better suited for the common workman.\u201d\n\nWith that, Kelle finally realizes his mistake. He quickly utters a polite, if rushed, farewell and half walks, half runs out the lecture hall. The other kids crowd around, offering their condolences for Kelle\u2019s behavior and promises that they\u2019ll support you if you were to report him to Master Gavin and the school\u2019s administration. A man (well, boy) of the people, you tell them that you\u2019re not planning to elevate it, that you\u2019re just wanting to focus on your studies, taking the higher path and the position of someone wronged, which will only increase their favor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re rather silent,\u201d you say to Prinn once the hall is empty again. \u201cThought you of all people would want to get a dig in or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps next time,\u201d Prinn answers, his voice soft in tone, wavering. \u201cListen, I\u2019m going to call it. See you tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\nPrinn leaves the hall. You stand a moment in victory, then go your own way.\n\nLittle did you know it would be the last time you saw the boy.\n\nUntil now.\n\nScoutleader Prinn stops scratching his chin. \u201cPerhaps the Alterans can be persuaded to waive the terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d you say. \u201cThey want nothing more than to send the garrison packing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s the case.\u201d Prinn\u2019s eyes fall on the bound Redding. Oh. A whistle escapes Prinn\u2019s lips, like that of a bird chirping in the forest, sounding eerily similar to ones you heard when first traveling through the New World jungle. Were the scouts following you the entire way? It matters little at this point. Leaves rustle in the wind, although you know it to be more than that. One of the green cloaks following his scoutleader\u2019s command. More still lie hidden around you. You\u2019re sure of that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered you would think of me so highly, but I\u2019m with the kid. I seriously doubt turning me in will cause the Alterans to keep hundreds of Magdan soldiers around,\u201d Redding says.\n\n\u201cThey will...because the true enemy, the Blackbirds, requires both of our nation\u2019s focus. They will be receiving a strong ally as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlteran was only able to capture the fort because of his--our--actions. Instead of chains, they may place a laurel on Redding\u2019s head,\u201d you say, leaving yourself out as part of the deal. So far it seems like Prinn is only interested in Redding. Placing obvious emphasis on the single man\u2019s exchange, will let you know Prinn\u2019s intention, whether or not you\u2019re to be included as well. You\u2019re not.\n\n\u201cIf that were the case, then you\u2019d have a small force of Alterans with you to rescue your war hero,\u201d Prinn easily answers. \u201cThis man is a fugitive, simple as that. You are too, but what\u2019s the expression? \u2018Bigger fish?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re set on following this through, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nPrinn replies with a nod.\n\n\u201cAnd nothing I say or do will change your mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You could try to stop me. Perhaps, you even could. But no, nothing will change my mind. I don\u2019t suggest you try, however.\u201d\n\nYour eyes briefly meet Redding\u2019s. He seems content where he is. Most men would struggle, show animosity towards their captor. Redding\u2019s expression is the same as sitting in an ale room, minus a little color in the cheeks. He seems interested to see how you will react, play the hero or the gambler, letting the cards fall where they may. You\u2019re not entirely sure yourself. But still, you are leaning towards one, if not slightly.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hero", "result": "You\u2019ve been a man of action your entire life, from childhood devising plans to get back at Kelle, to enlisting in the army and surviving many battles. Sitting around, letting others decide your fate, is nothing that you\u2019ve done before, and you\u2019re sure as hell not going to start now.\n\n(I know that look.)\nYou wanted more, artifact. You\u2019re getting it.\n(Ha! Yes! FIre me away. Let me taste them, drink their health, oops, I mean to their health!)\n\nSlightly worrying. Bigger fish.\n\nPrinn hasn\u2019t seen the artifact in action, the way it can reshape itself into various weapons, your favorite being the six-shooter. He doesn\u2019t know that the black ring on your finger is the dagger that Redding previously fought with, the very one that Alexander lended the aid of the garrison to recover, the one that the war party is after. He doesn\u2019t know until it\u2019s too late. The boy with blonde curls, now shaved, the boy who wore glasses, now apparently not needed, the boy whose life was changed forever by your childhood actions are once again changed by your willingness to act. His head, the one that Kelle shamed, stained with piss and tears, appears down the sight of the black barrel.\n\nBlack smoke fills the air. For a split second, the image of Prinn as a boy appears, down on his knees, unable to look you in the eye. The next, the image dissolves, replaced with one of the adult version, a red bullet hole squarely in the middle of his forehead. Prinn\u2019s body falls over backwards, landing with his green cloak spread out as if a picnic blanket. A few arrows spill from his quiver, the rope holding Redding falls from grasp. You don\u2019t have time to reflect, logging it to the list of questionable actions that you\u2019ve recently committed. There\u2019ll be a time to contemplate, pay for your deeds. Now, however, there are unseen enemies in the trees, deadly with the hunting bow.\n\n(Aww no fun!) The artifact becomes a tower shield in your hand, a solid slab of black, like staring through an open doorway in the middle of the night. Thwunk, thwunk, thwunk! Almost instantaneously, arrows land against the artifact, less than you expected, which only means that Prinn has a number of the green cloaks elsewhere, likely thinking that there wouldn\u2019t be much trouble at the hidden doorway. You and Redding already handled most of that, the bodies of the fallen Blackbirds still staining the creek with their blood.\n\nBefore another volley can be fired, the six-shooter appears in your hand. Best to make it quick. For a brief moment you\u2019ll be unprotected. Then again, so are the green cloaks. You fire several shots into the trees, using the angle of the blocked arrows as an imaginary line back towards the origin. You\u2019re rewarded with at least two small grunts and as many bodies plunging from the canopy, breaking branches and leaves along the way down. They hit the ground with a solid thud, a much deeper, fuller sound than their arrows ever made.\n\n(Mmm, gimme more to taste!)\nThere\u2019s no shortage of that, I assure you.\n\nThe artifact turns back into a shield as you await the next volley of arrows. It doesn\u2019t come. The forest is silent, save for background sounds of nature, the wind rustling through leaves, the occasional song of wildlife. Your breath becomes slow and steady, each exhale lasting for seemingly minutes at a time. Your eyes scan the trees looking for unseen enemies. They remain exactly that. If the green cloaks are reorganizing, you don\u2019t have much time. Free Redding and move on. Luckily, Prinn took care of Redding\u2019s wounds. You might have made a mess of things. There\u2019s at least one positive aspect of the current outcome, a second being that you escaped with your life. Speaking of Redding...\n\nHe stands exactly where Prinn left him, not even taking cover for the trees during the volley of arrows. He motions towards his bindings. \u201cCare to help me out, hero?\u201d\n\nWith the black dagger, you cut through the rope in a single slash. That word, \u201chero,\u201d doesn't sit well with you. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Redding says, stretching his arms and rubbing his wrists for blood flow. \u201cYou\u2019re becoming dangerous with that thing. It\u2019s like second-nature, the way you seamlessly cycle between forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I need a flintlock, I shoot. If arrows are fired at me, I need a shield. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d you answer. \u201cWhat\u2019s next for us? There are two armies, three if you count the war party, that are out to get us. We have no allies, no aid, no support. There\u2019s an entire New World in front of us and no friends to help accomplish the mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we have each other,\u201d Redding says, placing a hand on your shoulder. His eyes meet yours for a few calm seconds, then he breaks into a grin. \u201cDamn near had you going there, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, damn near had me questioning my decision to ever help you,\u201d you return back.\n\nYou scan the creek. It\u2019s littered with bodies, weapons, arrows. It\u2019s once-peaceful demeanor is replaced with the violence of man and the tools of destruction, perhaps a small example of what the New World would turn into, a glimpse into the future. Once a place filled with life, with nature content to mind to its own business is stained, marred by the invasion of man. Redding is right. The ways of the Old can\u2019t be brought to this place. There must be a new set of rules, a new way of living. The Old World is dying; the New can still be kept alive.", "action_results": [{"action": "Epilogue: The Ways of the New", "result": "A cave, deep in the New World forest, overlooks the sea, facing towards the Old World. Nearly a year ago, you arrived by ship, a soldier in the High King\u2019s army. Now you take the role of fugitive, hunted by your former nation as well as the native Blackbirds for the artifact you possess, an artifact that plays on your thoughts, speaking to you. Enemies are everywhere. Friends are few. But there are some, a small number, yes, but more than the one you started with. Speaking of the one, Redding emerges from the cave, his scraggly beard showing obvious signs where trimming is needed, even more so with its long length.\n\n\u201cWe best get a move on,\u201d he says, alluding to the fact that you\u2019re unable to stay in one place for very long.\n\nThe Blackbirds can sense the artifact, somehow. It\u2019s the reason they attacked the garrison shortly after recovering it in the first place. You didn\u2019t realize it then--thought it was just a coincidence; however, the hideouts you\u2019ve built for yourself over the next few months all were discovered by the Blackbirds. You\u2019ve honed in on their timing, spending only less than two weeks at any given location. It\u2019s not ideal, but there are more important issues. Voyages from the Old World seem to arrive by the day. An exaggeration, but still, they\u2019ve definitely picked up, civilian ships starting to join the navy vessels.\n\nYou sit outside of the cave stoking a small fire. After spending most of your time under the forest\u2019s canopy for the past year, you\u2019ve come to enjoy the time spent in the open air. The sky is a blanket of gray, coupled with snow-white fog, which hangs near the tops of the forest\u2019s trees. Full of life. Sinister. The New World is a place unlike any other. One moment it brings the thrill of discovery, the next, you\u2019re staring death in the face.\n\n(Enough reflection. \u2018Best get a move on.\u2019 There\u2019s blood to spill he-he...)\n\nYou ignore the voice, which has become your normal response over the past months. It\u2019s...changed, only concerned with battle, killing, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Blackbird or Old World blood. It thirsts. The frightening part is that you feel it too, a dry scratch at the back of your throat like waking up in the morning after a few too many ales. Satisfaction comes during skirmishes, but you haven\u2019t had any grand-scale battles since the garrison, small drops to wet the tongue; not enough to quench the thirst completely.\n\nThe water nearly to a boil, you pull a small pot away from the flame. Searching through your bag, you pull a small pouch of ground coffee, perks of your few friends. The warm liquid soothes your mind, a small comfort in a world of death and uncertainty. You offer some to Redding who shakes his head. \u201cThere\u2019s only one other thing I\u2019d rather drink than water and the ale room doesn\u2019t open until mid-morning,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThat and your face is probably a poster on the wall, a sizable sum underneath it,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cTrue, true.\u201d\n\nNo, there haven\u2019t been more grand-scale battles. To the artifact\u2019s dismay, your war is being fought on a different battlefield. Rather than finding victory by strength of sword arm and superior numbers, you\u2019re forced to fight on an individual level, your words of persuasion more of an ally than any sword, black blade or not. Oh sure, you\u2019re glad to have it when your words meet deaf ears, or those ears who find it their duty to cross blades against those who whisper such treasonous language. Then the artifact is momentarily happy, letting you hear each gleeful bite into the flesh of a man.\n\nWith more civilian vessels arriving, it at least allows you to infiltrate the Old World colonies with ease. Rather than needing a clean military uniform and names of a company and commander, you can pose as a common merchant, an explorer from the Old World journeying to the New to find fortune and fame. It\u2019s a good thing Frontrunner\u2019s Camp didn\u2019t build walls; it would have long expanded past them.\n\nIn only a year\u2019s time since you arrived, the stain of Old World civilization is starting to affect the New. It starts with Frontrunner\u2019s, but you know there are plans for many more colonies, which makes your mission that much more urgent. Get to the people while they are expanding before anything firm can be established. The World as a whole is on a knife\u2019s edge, could swing either way. You and Redding are doing your best to topple it in your favor, in the collective people\u2019s favor.\n\n(Too much sitting around. Need more action.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a time for that, don\u2019t you worry,\u201d Redding answers. Wait. Redding answered the voice? The man doesn\u2019t look at you as if some strange circumstance just occurred. He packs his bag, examining his longsword to see if it needs sharpening, a low hum of a tune emanating from the back of his throat.\n\nCare to explain?\n(Sometimes \u2018voices\u2019 are overheard.) You feel the mental equivalent of a shrug.\nBut whose voice was that? Mine or yours?\n(The man didn\u2019t seem to hear anyone besides his loyal sidekick.)\n\nFrustrating. You\u2019re sure to make the voice more talkative after battle. You log all your questions for another time, a time when the black blade is wet with blood. It\u2019s tight-lipped now, keeping secrets of its own. But after slaying several men, it\u2019ll sing at the tops of its lungs, mostly figuratively speaking, of course. Many questions you still have, and not enough answers to keep up with them all. But still, the mission takes precedence.\n\nThe mission is what matters, otherwise all those who stood in your way were removed for nothing, some, like Prinn, never to move again. Your reputation in Alteran, not to mention Magda, is ruined, at least when it comes to the chain of command. Rules, laws, regulations would put the noose around your neck without blinking an eye. To the common man, each individual link in the chain, you might find understanding for your actions. Empathy. Perhaps even an ally or two. You have found allies, and they\u2019re continuing to grow. The High King may love his chain of command; let\u2019s see how much he likes it when you pluck specific rings to your cause.\n\n\u201cCome, our contact awaits. The Blackbirds close in,\u201d Redding says.\n\nYou finish the remainder of the coffee and snuff the fire. You answer in a voice not entirely yours.\n\n(\u201cGood. My legs are cramped from all of this sitting.\u201d)", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Gambler", "result": "You\u2019ve never been much of a card player. Those you\u2019ve played with fellow soldiers over the years have never amounted to much. Sure, there\u2019s been a few lucky nights, but not as many as there should have been. It\u2019s not even that you\u2019re unable to keep a blank face when need be. Bluffing, lying is actually something that you\u2019re fairly decent at. It\u2019s simply that lady luck has you in the perpetual dog house, feeling as if a woman scorned towards you, the odds never falling in your favor. Lady luck, a bitch if you ever knew one.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing until now, isn\u2019t it? Playing your best with the hand dealt to you. That\u2019s all anyone does. Or is that simply the lie we tell ourselves? Life is a card game. You can\u2019t control the hand dealt, a random shuffle. But you can do the best with what you have, even if it\u2019s a losing hand from the start. You know all about that from actual card games. No, life can\u2019t be the same. You\u2019ll not allow it to be the same. The analogy assumes one\u2019s life is set according to a specific set of rules. You won\u2019t play that game. You\u2019ve never had success with the game. Instead, you remove yourself from the equation, and allow circumstances to play out.\n\n\u201cYou may run into enemies on the way,\u201d you start. \u201cBut I\u2019m not to be included as one of them.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, Redding smiles at this. You just sealed the man\u2019s fate for execution, and he...smiles. Part of you realizes the struggle you\u2019ve made it through to save his life--just to throw it away now. But you\u2019re not throwing it away. That implies action. You\u2019re simply letting the circumstance play out according to the actions of each player. Besides, what are you going to do? Shoot a childhood friend, fight your way through more than ten unseen scouts? No. Redding knew the risks. His plan was well-thought out, but it wasn\u2019t thorough enough. It didn\u2019t account for the Alterans invading. On the plus side, that\u2019s something that would have never happened in the Old; it\u2019d take a lot for a direct confrontation to occur. Perhaps the ways of the New are blossoming on their own. Perhaps that\u2019s why Redding is smiling.\n\n\u201cNo fight? I must admit I\u2019m rather surprised,\u201d Prinn says, checking the bonds of Redding, making to depart back to the garrison.\n\n(And I\u2019m disappointed.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been enough bloodshed between those who I wouldn\u2019t count among my own enemies,\u201d you say.\n\nPrinn just nods and makes for the trees. It\u2019s silent between all speakers for a moment, sending the small sounds of the creek into your ears like white rapids. \u201cI remember you, you know,\u201d he says at last. \u201cA distant memory. It\u2019s foggy. But you\u2019re there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember you too,\u201d you answer. \u201cAlthough my memory is clear. You disappeared. There one day, gone the next. It was the talk of the school for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes...I went somewhere,\u201d Prinn says, distant, like a man waking from a bad dream. \u201cI remember laughing, not laughter of my own, not laughter in joy. Just, laughter. At me.\u201d\n\n\u201cKelle?\u201d\n\nFor a second, Prinn\u2019s face flashes ugly. It\u2019s the face of a husband finding out his wife betrayed him, mixed with the face of the wife herself, shame and secret bore for all to see. Then it\u2019s back to blank and expressionless, a slate of a man not yet sculpted, empty. \u201cKelle\u2026\u201d he ponders. \u201cI do not remember that name.\u201d\n\nRedding and you glance at one another, forgetting the fact that he\u2019s a prisoner sentenced to death for a moment. No words need to be shared between you; it\u2019s obvious to him that Prinn remembers the name, whether it\u2019s suppressed by the mind or not, a spotty memory like that of a trauma victim.\n\n\u201cDo you know what happened to Kelle?\u201d you repeat the name again.\n\nMixture. Flash. Blank. \u201cI do not know of who you speak of.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Kelle?\u201d Redding, this time, asks. The third mention of the name breaks through the barrier. Prinn\u2019s face returns to the mixture, but does not revert back to the slate. His skin turns red, hot. Like a sticky gear finally finding its groove, recognition appears. Another quick glance between you and Redding. His eyes seem to shrug.\n\n\u201cKelle...I remember now\u2026 He was evil and (was) bullied those smaller than him. Smart, yes. But not the smartest. Strong, yes. But only towards those weaker than himself.\u201d\n\nYou attempt to guide Prinn\u2019s thoughts. \u201cHe disappeared. Not long after a couple of...disagreements between us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes...that\u2019s right,\u201d Prinn speaks to the empty air. \u201cHe was no doubt planning retaliation. To hit us worse than we hit him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the plan,\u201d you say. \u201cTo damage his reputation in front of the other students and let Kelle, himself, finish the deed. We put him in poor standing. One attempt at revenge, publicly known, would have him thrown from the school, despite who his father was. Except he disappeared before that could happen. You--\u201d\n\n\u201cWe both did,\u201d Prinn finishes your next words.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cI adjusted the plan. Made it so he could never prey on the weak again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd exactly how did you do that?\u201d Redding asks. You briefly imagine him raising an eyebrow. He doesn\u2019t, of course.\n\nPrinn turns to him. \u201cIsn\u2019t the answer obvious?\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t the answer obvious? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Of course it is. Young Prinn, after leaving the lecture hall, can\u2019t stop a feeling deep within. It\u2019s like an itch that can\u2019t be scratched, the tingling of a limb when falling asleep at an awkward position. It\u2019s so simple. Prinn knows how to make it so Kelle doesn\u2019t retaliate. A plan truly that\u2019s thorough enough. End Kelle, end the suffering. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nHe wishes he kept the green cloak with him, the one that he wore in the forest a week earlier. It made him feel powerful. Strong. Not like the brainiac everyone believes him to be. But he is, though. Why should he pretend to be someone else?\n\nBecause brainiacs get bullied. Pissed on.\n\nThe strong don\u2019t. Prinn\u2019s best friend, despite not testing higher than the bottom 10% of the class, proved that fact. And Prinn\u2019s memory retention is second-to-none. A mere glance at a page, and he can recite the words flawlessly. Facts, history, mathematical formulas: they appear to him in his mind, easily located like finding one\u2019s horse in the stable. He\u2019s glad to have learned it early in his life before any more time is wasted: knowledge is useless without the authority to act upon it. He\u2019s spent his entire life, albeit a short one so far, focused on discovering knowledge. Useless, without the strength of the arm as a foundation.\n\nFor the first time Prinn doesn\u2019t have a plan. What good are plans anyway? They\u2019re a tunnel, forcing the planner into a single-lane road. Prinn\u2019s mind is quick. Better to leave all options open and adapt to the circumstance. It clicks in his mind the way a buckle clasps for the first time. Infinite choices are at one\u2019s fingertips. The likelihood of accounting for every option, having the plan go according to...well, the plan is slim to none. Account for nothing, adapt, and you\u2019ll never find yourself at a loss.\n\nKelle ducks into a building. Prinn knows it well. It\u2019s a place designed for experiments of science. Students, with the proper credentials, can use a laboratory for themselves. Most use it for alchemical purposes, the rare few at Prinn\u2019s age know chemistry. There\u2019s no guard. No doorman. If you hadn\u2019t received a key from the main office, you can\u2019t enter. Kelle has a key. So does Prinn. Waiting a few minutes after Kelle, Prinn takes the small five-step staircase to the building. The hallways are empty. Occupants are either in their labs or unable to be called as such. Prinn always hated the floors here. Black and white checkered tile. Unlike the rest of the campus, built from polished wood, the laboratory has a cold feeling with it, lifeless, like the students are mere pieces on a board game.\n\nPrinn doesn\u2019t have a plan, although thoughts are starting to emerge. He\u2019s adapting. Each laboratory is mostly private. There are no windows, for safety reasons. Any experiment gone wrong is contained in the room. All that connects the lab to the outside hallway is a small slit in the door, a rectangle chunk carved from reinforced steel, oddly reminiscent to the small opening a prisoner would receive moldy bread and cheese. It\u2019s through the slits that Prinn scans through the labs. Cold, lifeless, his body adapts to the very building itself. He passes by a few, creeping along on the balls of his feet. A few older students are working on potions, the occasional firework. Citizens love fireworks, and the school will pay good money for a student who makes them. Not as good as the school will sell them for, but hey, it\u2019s better than sticking your nose in a book at a deficit. Finally, Prinn finds his mark. His experiment. His prey.\n\nThrough the slit in the door, Prinn watches Kelle, unaware of the boy looking into his lab. The room itself is a slice of nature. Like the slit, it\u2019s a rectangle in shape, two long walls, two short ones. Unlike the rest of the building, however, it\u2019s a jungle; stepping into the lab is like being in a small clearing. Vines and trees fill the walls and ceiling, complete with a dirt floor, mimicking a real jungle floor. Various plants fill the \u201cclearing,\u201d shapes of bright red, purple, and white shine brilliantly against the dimly-lit lab. In the center, built from wooden planks, is an alchemy table. Tubes, beakers, and smaller vials rest on top. More underneath. Prinn watches Kelle grab for a few ingredients, plucking them from their artificial spot of growth. Once he\u2019s collected enough, the boy returns to the table, finding a mortar and pestle.\n\nHis target distracted, Prinn decides to act. He studies the cadence of Kelle\u2019s mixing. One, two, three, Prinn unlatches the door to the lab at the exact moment Kelle would engage the next motion of the mortar. It\u2019s not the best, but it\u2019s the best in the current situation, which Prinn has no problem taking advantage of. He slides the door open to a small crack, just enough to where he can slip through unnoticed. The door closes without a sound, the boy, himself, following suit. The light is low. Dim. Mimicking natural light from an actual jungle. It helps the students focus, according to Master Gavin. Out away from magelight or candlelight, it forces the alchemist to be immersed in the environment. Prinn, a shadow between trees, a silent stalker in the jungle, creeps forward. End Kelle, end the suffering. Simple as that.\n\nHis target\u2019s back is turned, busy mixing and grinding different ingredients to dust. Prinn, but a boy who would grow up to lead the scouts in the New World, briefly steps into his future self, channeling his studies, focusing them in his mind. Strength of body. Strength of mind. Prinn\u2019s relied on the latter for too long. It\u2019s about time he became one of the strong.\n\nThe knife briefly flashes in the artificially-lit room, a twinkle of steel like the first stars of the night appearing in the nightsky. Kelle doesn\u2019t turn. He doesn\u2019t face the boy in the eye, the boy who he bullied, shamed. Quick and efficient. Prinn thrusts the dagger forward without drawing it back. Quick and efficient, he slides it into Kelle\u2019s lower back. It cuts easily into the boy\u2019s skin as if a farmer digging through fertile soil.\n\nAnd just like that, it\u2019s over. There\u2019s no rush of panic that falls over Prinn\u2019s body, the coming down after a passion-fueled deed. His hands are steady. His mind is clear. Prinn scans the lab for the necessary ingredients. Cleaning up will take awhile, but everything he needs is present. Blood begins to darken the dirt at the base of the table. Prinn takes a deep breath and readies himself for hours of work, mentally running through each task needed to be performed in order. Kelle isn\u2019t even breathing and he\u2019s causing problems for Prinn, still. The gruesome thought brings small curves to the corner of Prinn\u2019s lips. That soon won\u2019t be the case.\n\nEnd Kelle, end the suffering. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\n\u201cEnd Kelle, end the suffering,\u201d Scoutleader Prinn finishes, trancelike.\n\nYou and Redding glance at each other. You\u2019re not used to seeing Redding without words lining up to leave his mouth. The line\u2019s empty now, and the same can be said for your own. Three shadows, donned in green, become a blur in the corner of your vision. The scouts drop down from trees towering overhead, two of which draw their hunting bows and aim them at you. They aren\u2019t as concerned with Redding, who is still bound and tied. The third scout pulls an object from his belt, something small that fits in the palm of his hand. He walks over to his scoutleader, takes one of his hands, and places the object in his palm.\n\nPrinn looks at his palm like a card player playing with known cheats. Recognition appears in his eyes, like the act of scanning a crowd and finding the person you\u2019re looking for. It seems to take him from the trance. He is back to the stern, if not expressionless, leader as before. He hands the object back to the scout, hiding it from your view. He places a hand on the scout\u2019s shoulder in appreciation, the way an aging father treats a son.\n\n\u201cIt was the talk of the school for years,\u201d you break the silence. \u201cBoth you and Kelle suddenly vanished one day, and you know how kids like to spread rumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left,\u201d the scoutleader says. \u201cAll that I could have learned during months of studying, I learned that day. I pursued knowledge in a more...applicable setting. Kelle,\u201d he spits the name, \u201cwas (was) the first of many. When I accomplished all that I could in the city, I came to the place where the world makes sense, both of them. Nature. Uncivilized land. It runs on rules far greater than the ones that we create for ourselves.\u201d\n\n(he sounds a lot like...)\n...Redding, I know.\n\n\u201cBut you,\u201d Prinn continues. \u201cYou ran away to Alteran and actively opposed the Supreme Leader. I suppose I should be asking you why, but now is not the time or place. Just answer me this: why did you run from Magda in the first place?\u201d\n\nThe question hangs heavy in the air. Prinn looks at you expectantly. Redding the same. It\u2019s the question that\u2019s hunted you from a young age. It first appeared in your mind as a youth, an itch of a thought that you couldn\u2019t scratch, not until you actually left the country of your birth. Why did you run from your home? The answer is simple, more simple than something of this magnitude should be. When you trace the origin, the root, however, it\u2019s the cause behind everything.\n\nYou open your mouth and speak. \u201cRestlessness.\u201d\n\nPrinn simply nods, understanding. \u201cThen I hope you find the rest that you seek.\u201d\n\nRedding puts his thoughts to words as well. \u201cRemember what we spoke about. See you on the other side, kid. Don\u2019t do anything...stupid.\u201d\n\nWith that, Prinn leads Redding, his prisoner, out from the creek. You have no doubt that the scouts are following in the trees overhead. You stand alone. No allies or nation to run back to, alone in a New World far from your beginnings. They say the New World is many times larger than the Old. An entire world lies before you ready to be discovered. Tamed. The cards have revealed destiny for each player. Prinn rose from a schoolboy to a scoutleader. Redding, ever the idealist, finally caught up with--and not seeming surprised or scared to face the music. Perhaps that was his plan all along. One man\u2019s death can have more impact than another\u2019s life.\n\nFor the third time you scan the creek, marred by your presence. Forever stained with the blood you spilled. Smooth stones with moss. Running water, once clear. Bodies strewn exactly where you ended the Blackbird warriors. Off in the distance, a bird chirps, filling in small gaps of silence between the creek and wind, softly whispering at your neck. For the third time you scan the creek; in this case, it\u2019s the last.", "action_results": [{"action": "Epilogue: The Martyr", "result": "Nighttime falls. Rather than magelight, traditional flame torches line the interior of the fort, sending shadows dancing in the wind. The Alterans, in occupation of their rival\u2019s fort, have cause to celebrate tonight: the capture of a turncoat; the execution of a traitor. In a matter of minutes, Redding\u2019s lifeless body will hang from the ramparts. Such is the punishment for betrayal.\n\nOnce again you find yourself in a place you thought you\u2019d never revisit, and like the creek, you have a feeling it will be your last. It wasn't hard to catch an Alteran patrol unaware. Standard protocol doesn\u2019t leave much room for deviation. No, you knew exactly where the four soldiers would be patrolling and exactly the distance around the keep. By the time their bodies are found, you\u2019ll be long gone. Keeping pace with your environment, you\u2019re dressed in Alteran blue, a generous gift from one of the patrolling soldiers. It\u2019s a little tight around the shoulders, but hey, free is free.\n\nThey\u2019ve gathered you, the majority of the Alteran occupation, in the center of the fort facing the ramparts. Alterans like their speeches, after all. Rows and rows of blue stand perfectly at attention, patiently waiting for the three men on the ramparts to begin the festivities, Captain Briggs, Lionel, and a third that you don\u2019t recognize. At their feet sits the object that\u2019s brought you here. It sits a coiled snake, a predator lying in wait. The noose.\n\nYou have a hood pulled, covering the top half of your face. Not that you expect to run into someone that you know, but better safe than sorry. It\u2019s for their sake. Any recognition of Redding\u2019s \u201csidekick\u201d would likely be swiftly met with an introduction to your own \u201csidekick\u201d sitting on your hip, a black, wing-tipped artifact craving more action. You don\u2019t have to wait long. This is the military. Schedules are followed. Maintained. Gather the battalion an hour after dusk. A quarter-hour later, hang a man until dead. Back in the bunk by nightfall.\n\n(Any chance you\u2019ll be needing me?)\nA chance, yes.\n\nYou feel the equivalent of a mental sigh. The artifact may be a weapon of immense power, but often the voice appears as an immature child, even more concerning considering what could happen if it decided to act out like immature children tend to do. Movement on the ramparts. Captain Briggs raises a hand to silence the soldiers, who aren\u2019t even speaking amongst themselves.\n\n\u201cBy the High King\u2019s guidance, we have arrived across the sea to the New World, a vast, primal place that seeks to claim our lives. The land itself is in direct opposition to our homeland. It\u2019s uncivilized. Its natives, the Blackbirds, are without discipline and order. They are cannibals. Pagans. And as the land will be made New Alteran, so too shall the natives become Alteran...or perish.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers offer a cheer. They know when one\u2019s expected. You do not, however.\n\nAnother hand raise. \u201cYet, there is one among us who would throw away the High King\u2019s good grace. A traitor. One that would trade his navy for crimson, the color of the High King\u2019s greatest rival. (There\u2019s visible disgust at this. More than a few spit on the ground.) His company was put in chains, herded around like animals. That\u2019s not how a soldier of Alteran should be treated! Enter, traitor. Enter, betrayer. Enter, Redding.\u201d Captain Briggs spits Redding\u2019s name worse than when he mentioned the Supreme Leader Fargrave. You suppose turncoats beat rivals when it comes to levels of disgust. Checks out.\n\nThe formation of soldiers part like running water in a creek, moving around smooth stones. Rather than a moss-covered piece of earth, they make room for a man clad in chains, a pair at both his ankles and wrists. The man doesn\u2019t look disheartened in the least to be arriving at his execution. If anything, he looks pleased, a signature grin at the corner of his lips. You\u2019re not in a town square filled with citizens who would scream curses and throw rotten fruit. You\u2019re at a military camp of the World\u2019s most disciplined army (although the Supreme Leader would disagree); the soldiers are stoic, causing a somber tone to fall over the men. It\u2019s eerie, a thousand men silent, save for the shuffling of feet and clinking of chains. A man is to be put to death. A man who once stood in their place. Perhaps they are imagining themselves in Redding\u2019s boots. After what seems like an eternity, Redding and his escorts travel the switch-back staircase and arrive at the top of the ramparts.\n\nFrom your position--in the middle of the formation--you can hardly see the features of those standing on the ramparts. Redding, you know, likely holds the same grin. There\u2019s a good chance Briggs does as well; it\u2019s a great honor to end the insurgence of the soldiers under your command. No doubt word will get back to Alteran of the great and legendary Captain Briggs, conquering the New World under the High King\u2019s name, putting a traitorous soldier to death as an example to all who would follow in their footsteps. Five now stand, overlooking the Alteran battalion. You watch from the center of the formation.\n\nCaptain Briggs takes a step forward, stares Redding in the eyes, as if determining what to do with the man. Theatrics, of course. He knows damn well what he plans to do. But this is a show for the battalion. A show of dominance. An example to all. He slaps Redding in the face. It couldn\u2019t have been that hard. Slaps are more damaging to the ego than anything else, but the sound rings over the silent crowd in the pitch of an overboard sailor landing flat against the waves of the sea. You can\u2019t hear the words, but it appears Redding fired back with a few choice words. They must have been good ones, from Redding they typically are, as Briggs seems to be affected with the next portion of his speech. Part of theatrics is going off-script. It works well when done effectively. However, when emotion is the cause, it falls flat.\n\n\u201cThis...this...traitor,\u201d Briggs spits again, \u201cis to be hung until the breath in his betraying lungs fails. The High King will always triumph against those who would seek to tarnish his good name.\u201d You can\u2019t help but notice the lack of enthusiasm from the soldiers. Typically, whenever the good High King\u2019s name is mentioned, there are visible agreements, at the very least murmurings of affirmation. There\u2019s no such accompaniment. \u201cHe will be an example to ALL. The High King\u2019s gaze is vast. He sees all--even the whispers of treason. You, turncoat, any last words?\u201d\n\nRedding takes a step forward. His toes must be hanging over the rampart\u2019s edge. \u201cYes, a few. More than a few, actually, but I\u2019ll keep it brief. I know you have a date with your sword arm tonight.\u201d Only Redding would crack a joke like that during his execution.\n\n(Kinda wishing I bonded to him now. The man\u2019s anything but a bore.)\nNo you don\u2019t. Otherwise you\u2019d be resting on Briggs\u2019 hip.\n(...fair point.)\n\n\u201cThey call me a traitor. They charge me with treason,\u201d Redding continues, then pauses for effect. \u201cAnd they\u2019re right.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a reaction to the High King\u2019s mentioning, but there sure as hell is now. Low murmurs start between the soldiers, perhaps thinking Redding was originally falsely accused. Here it is, though, confessing to his crimes. Redding\u2019s voice suddenly cracks with thunder, quaking the very ground beneath their boots. A chine runs down your spine.\n\n\u201cBUT THE LAWS OF THE OLD DON\u2019T APPLY TO THE NEW!\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cLet the High King govern Alteran. Let him sit and gain weight, fat on his throne. Alteran boasts the best tailors in the world. Surely they can hem his royalty\u2019s robes a few inches out.\u201d You hear one or two snickers. No one would willingly disrespect the High King, although laughter is hard to contain, especially during inappropriate moments. \u201cWhat right does he have to dictate our lives in the New World? What does he contribute besides helping ease ourselves of the burden of wealth?\u201d\n\nBehind Redding, Captain Briggs motions to Lionel. Your former company member reaches for the noose and examines it before slipping it over Redding\u2019s head. The former corporal doesn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\n\u201cTell me, have any of you actually seen the High King? Have any of you actually felt his good will? It\u2019s a lie! It\u2019s the whip upon your back, the hand in your coin purse. Your lives are not your own. You\u2019re simply a piece in the machine; the only value placed on your lives is dependent upon how well you perform your part. I\u2019ve taken a step back. I\u2019ve removed myself from the machine entirely. I\u2019m truly free. The High King doesn\u2019t control my life.\u201d\n\nSomeone shouts from the crowd. \u201cBold words, a man claims to be free while shackled awaiting execution.\u201d\n\nYou can almost feel the grin widening to a full-toothed smile. Redding set the trap perfectly. He raises his arms up, and the soldiers can\u2019t help but audibly gasp. It\u2019s as if they\u2019ve become spectators in a wizard\u2019s light show. The shackles around Redding\u2019s wrists fall from their place, tumbling down the rampart\u2019s staircase in a loud crash--or crashes; you count six in total, a number that you\u2019ve recently become accustomed to counting.\n\n\u201cI am bound by no man. By no idea. I answer only to myself. As should you all. A New World lies at your fingertips and yet you\u2019re content to stay shackled. You\u2019re but oxen doing the bidding of the farmer, docile cattle, with no mind of their own. The World is yours to discover!\u201d\n\nBriggs and the others rush to reclasp the chains around Redding\u2019s wrists. He doesn\u2019t pay them any regard, just continues speaking, words increasingly becoming heard among the battalion.\n\n\u201cI choose my own path. I choose this. I choose to serve as an example, yes--Briggs is right. I face my death as a free man, bound by no unseen leader, free from simply playing a part in a collective machine. No man commands my life but my own. No man commands my death but my own. Freedom is yours for the taking. You\u2019ve got a short amount of years left. Take it.\u201d\n\nWith that, Redding scans the crowd. Somehow, some way, standing within a thousand soldiers his eyes seem to meet yours. It\u2019s as if he sensed your presence, knew that you would follow him to the death. His death. See you on the other side, kid. Redding leaps from the ramparts. Time slows in that moment, his arms outstretched in the air, Briggs and the others unable to completely lock the chains around his wrists. Your eyes, like every single pair in the battalion, grow wide, unable to believe what they are seeing. A man free. A man who has the ability to escape from his shackles--and likely his holding cell--willingly throwing himself to death. The man is choosing to die in the exact way he chose to live: on his own terms.\n\nA sickening crack echoes over the battalion as Redding\u2019s neck snaps on impact, shortly followed by the steady creak of rope, like a ship settling in at sea. Redding\u2019s body lifelessly sways back and forth, the momentum from his jump still carrying his body in movement, like the way a street performer would sway a pocket watch, attempting to hypnotize a volunteer from the crowd. In a way, it\u2019s exactly that. Hypnotizing. The words of power already have been spoken to the crowd. Now it\u2019s up to them to act. And they do.\n\nChaos ensues.\n\nNot six seconds later, and you\u2019re counting, the battalion bursts into motion. Soldier against commander. Soldier against soldier. A thousand soldiers split into two different categories in an instant, those who would be free and those clinging to the ways of the Old. Steel is drawn against former allies. Flintlocks are fired. The roar is unlike anything you\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s as if standing underneath a rushing waterfall. It\u2019s louder than any battlefield you\u2019ve fought on, louder than a battering ram punching through a main gate.\n\nYou take part to the artifact\u2019s great joy.\n\n(Finally, finally, finally. I told you that man isn\u2019t--wasn\u2019t--boring!)\n\nWith the surrender of one man\u2019s life, he\u2019s gained the hearts of hundreds of soldiers to his cause. Redding\u2019s body hangs overhead like a religious symbol, and the initiating rites are taking place in the battalion. The artifact becomes a blade in your hand as you don\u2019t have enough time to wait for the reload. Here and there, however, the six-shooter appears to ring quick death before transitioning back to a longsword in small thunderclouds. A few recognize you. It appears on their face in two parts: paralyzing remembrance, then heightened fury. You put them down just the same. The ways of the Old World are dying, and you expedite the process with each swing of your sword, each shot fired.\n\nRedding must have planned this all along, you think mid-swing. That\u2019s why he was content to be taken prisoner--it afforded him the platform to send his message to the entire battalion. Say what you will about the man, there\u2019s something commendable about possessing an ideology that surpasses death. Most men spend their lives avoiding the end; the rare few focus on their mission, placing more emphasis on accomplishing it than avoiding death. Redding used his own death as a tool. The man was right. He\u2019s not bound by anything, even ending his own life.\n\nYou parry a longsword aside and lunge forward, allowing the black blade to taste Alteran blood. Two more stand in your fallen opponent\u2019s place. You don\u2019t wait for them to attack. You meet their sudden appearance with a fury fueled by your mentor\u2019s death, losing yourself to the flow of battle. Thoughts are distant. You know only the next breath, the next swing of your sword. Clarity. Your mind becomes its own, guiding your body; you\u2019re but a passenger on the journey of destruction.\n\nYesterday, it was two men with an idea to transform an entire New World. Today, you\u2019re hundreds, yet even more lie in opposition. WIth the artifact in-hand, the black weapon that will most assuredly draw another war party attack, you cut through the ranks of those holding to the Old ways. You\u2019ll be prepared for their next attack. If they can track the artifact, perhaps the artifact can track the Blackbirds\u2026Redding\u2019s message will transcend nation and borderlines. There are bound to be more in Magda\u2019s tattered garrison that would join the cause, and more are no doubt on their way, voyaging from the Old World.\n\nYesterday, two.\n\nToday, hundreds.\n\nTomorrow, thousands.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "A tea party", "result": "Smug bastard. I swear I\u2019ll repay him sevenfold for this. Instead, joyous laughter erupts from Captain Alexander\u2019s mouth upon the finishing of his counterpart\u2019s tale. Alexander brings his cup of tea to his lips to drink, but more importantly, to hide his true feelings on the matter. The cup, already small, looks child\u2019s size in his hands. He\u2019s not the most chiseled of men, but the soldier of Magda boasts shoulders little boys attribute to war heroes. That\u2019s what I am, am I not?\n\nNot in this case.\n\nFirst the Blackbirds, then the damn Alterans. Rules of war dictate he must host the conquering party. It\u2019s not the first time in Alexander\u2019s career. His win percentage is damn commendable; it\u2019s what thrust him to command in the first place. Here, however, here in the New World the Supreme Leader was counting on him. And he failed. It\u2019s not the defeat that shames him. Losing battles are part of war. It\u2019s the manner in which he lost.\n\nFirst the Blackbirds, then the damn Alterans.\n\nNatives. Savages. Against a fort. No siege weapons. No ranged weapons, save for a few tossed spears. And somehow they manage to punch a hole through his goddam gate. They poured in like fire ants from a hill. Magic, Alexander surmises. It had to be magic.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get him started on the Alterans. The man sitting in front of him, telling a story of invading one of the lesser-known republics of the Old World--with apparent embellishment--would be labeled a war hero. No, he doesn\u2019t possess the sheer size of Alexander, he doesn\u2019t look like a hero, but still, his name will be written in the history books for eternity. Captain Briggs the Conqueror. Sent Alexander and his army home, tail tucked between their legs without losing a single soldier. Likely, the same embellishment would apply, Briggs himself single handedly defeating twenty men or some bullshit like that.\n\n\u201cSuch savages they are. Crude weapons, pagan religion. They bring dishonor to a civilized man\u2019s war, wouldn\u2019t you say, Captain?\u201d\n\nAlexander is brought from his thoughts. \u201cI would say so, indeed, (smug bastard) Captain. Shameful.\u201d\n\nWorse yet, his secret weapon, the very man who was supposed to turn the tide is missing in the forest. Most of his men believe Redding and his...pupil? Understudy? Sidekick? were the reason for the Alterans sudden appearance. Alexander isn\u2019t so sure that\u2019s the case. It\u2019s just unfortunate timing. Redding\u2019s always been a loose cannon, but Alexander believes him not to be the double, well, triple-crossing type. The former corporal has always done his own thing. Defecting back to the Alterans isn\u2019t in his best interests, is it?\n\nLikely not. But Alexander will take the fall for trusting an Alteran.\n\nRedding and that damn artifact. He was obsessed with it before either man departed for the New World.\n\nAt a roadside inn near the border, Alexander waits patiently for his contact. Dressed in simple traveler\u2019s garb, he looks nothing like the polished soldier he is, except for his stern demeanor and perfect posture. That\u2019s not an attribute of a simple traveler. If anything, travelers are hunched forward, having a constant ache in the back, the burden of the road.\n\nThe door swings open, sending in a rush of cool night air. It\u2019s refreshing after sitting by the hearth for so long, the ale warming his cheeks in accompaniment. A man with a scraggly beard, not a single gray hair with similar traveler\u2019s garb, enters. Most men finding an inn during the night have a stressed look about them, results of the journey. Not this man. A constant grin sits at his face. He takes a seat across from Alexander, but first takes the cup that the big man is sipping at and takes several gulps, some of the contents spilling onto his face.\n\n\u201cNo, no, please. By all means,\u201d Alexander comments.\n\n\u201cA kind offer, to say the least,\u201d the man says, a bit of ale dripping from his beard. The innkeeper approaches, a port-bellied man in a brown apron, the sleeves of his tunic rolled up to his elbows.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, newcomer?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe roast for me and my friend. Don\u2019t go easy on the seasoning. And two tankards of your house\u2019s finest.\u201d\n\nThe port-bellied man nods and returns back behind the bar, a kitchen beyond the bottles of spirits. Alexander eyes his contact. There\u2019s something about the man that Alexander can\u2019t put his finger on. An attribute that escapes his mind. Whether you put this man in the center of a harem or in the middle of a snowstorm, his demeanor would likely be the same, a kind of man that follows his own actions, despite present company and authority. A man who speaks the truth, unafraid of the consequences.\n\nStraight to business. Efficient, like a soldier in the Supreme Leader\u2019s employ. \u201cRedding, right? I received your letters. I\u2019ve got to ask, why me? I\u2019m just a lieutenant with limited influence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you always plan to be a lieutenant with limited influence?\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough. We could be hung for a meeting like this, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you came anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet I came anyway. Now I\u2019d like answers, sooner than later. The longer I stay, the greater the risk.\u201d\n\nRedding leans forward in his chair, casually propping his leg on top of the other, far too casual for Alexander\u2019s liking. He\u2019s right: they could be hung for treason if a member of the Magda military found them together. It took many attempts to meet before Alexander finally agreed.\n\n\u201cYou have heard the rumors of the New World, have you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I have. Everyone\u2019s heard by now, including the innkeeper here. News like that doesn\u2019t stay strictly within the military.\u201d\n\nSeemingly at the mention of his name, the innkeeper places two tankards on the table. They land with a solid thud, spilling a few streaks of liquid down the sides. The man takes the now empty cup that Redding downed and leaves the two men back to whispering secrets of war. Every good innkeeper knows to give two strangers in the night plenty of space. Not because of manners, but because of denial of involvement.\n\nRedding takes his tankard and taps it against Alexander\u2019s without a proper toast or warning. He takes a long sip, then speaks. \u201cOur way of living will soon be obsolete. Alteran, Magda, the other republics and territories here--they all follow the same set of rules. It transcends borders. The laws written by the High King are written by the Supreme Leader. Tell me, Alexander. You enlisted as an infantryman and worked your way up to lieutenant. How many worthless rules and regulations have you blindly followed without question because it\u2019s what you were told to do?\u201d\n\nAlexander thinks back to his first few years in the infantry. Gods, he hated physical training in the \u201cPT Uni.\u201d Stiff breeches, a tucked tunic, complete with a sash at his waist and a thin, long sleeved jacket. A soldier always had to look proper, even when training to run for miles and performing pushups to failure, both of which could have been expanded with looser clothing standards. \u201cA few come to mind,\u201d is his reply.\n\nRedding nods. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in my country. The rules of our societies won\u2019t apply in the New World. There\u2019s no question that our nations will be leading the expeditions. Whether Magda or Alteran leads in that regard, it means little to me. They have the same basic agenda. Subdue. Conquer. Force their way of living. We find ourselves at a crucial point in history. There must be a new set of rules or we will die in the ways of the Old.\u201d\n\nAlexander sits back in his chair, crossing his arms in thought. He doesn\u2019t touch the new tankard of ale placed in front of him. He\u2019s starting to think Redding knew that he wouldn\u2019t and ordered two for himself. \u201cAnd who do you think will support this new way of life? No one will support your rule unless you take it by force.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. You misunderstand.\u201d Another tankard down. \u201cA lone ruler is how we got into this mess in the first place, a man too important to busy himself with the day-to-day, so he creates a position for another to handle that stuff. That man does the same, and so on. Monarchy is the way of beaucraticship, oddly enough. Tyranny is efficient, but unsustainable through eventual revolutions. Councils, republics, democracies--they\u2019re plagued by the same inability to do anything meaningful. What I\u2019m talking about is pure absolving of the system of government that we know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about anarchy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nAlexander unfolds his arms and leans on the table. Suddenly the conversation feels too risky, even with a proprietor who is intentional about privacy. His voice lowers. \u201cIs it even possible?\u201d\n\nRedding matches his posture. \u201cThe New World is far from our leaders\u2019 grasp. We\u2019ll need to act fast before their hands grab a hold, before colonies can be established. I take it you\u2019re in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear you out. If I don\u2019t like what I hear, I\u2019m walking out that door never to speak again.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Redding says with his subtle grin. \u201cHere\u2019s what we must do\u2026\u201d", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "The ramparts", "result": "Private First Class Erikkson surveys the scene in front of him, arrow nocked, bowstring yet undrawn. His first tour, here in the New World, is nothing like he expected. For one, there\u2019s no glory. He imagined triumphantly marching through cities, citizens lined on the streets cheering, offering gifts, fathers their daughters. That\u2019s what the recruiter promised, is it not? Instead, he\u2019d been stuck on a boat for weeks, stomping through the forest, and standing post and the very same spot on the ramparts. He\u2019s memorized every notch in the wood wall, each scratch, scuff mark, blackened torch burn. And now, shadowy figures appear in front of the garrison, seemingly out of nowhere. PFC Erikkson shutters to think if the scoutleader didn\u2019t warn the garrison in time--they likely would have been overrun.\n\nThe bow in his hand feels heavier than it did yesterday. Erikkson is aware of the bowstring against his fingers. It\u2019s rougher today, foreign almost. As suddenly as the natives showed up on their doorstep, all moisture evaporates from his tongue. It sticks to the top of Erikkson\u2019s mouth, dry and rough. Erikkson swallows. It feels better, slightly.\n\nHis attention draws towards the letter tucked safely in his pocket underneath his steel breastplate. He\u2019d read it countless times, long memorizing the single page of words. Hell, he had it memorized before stepping off the boat. Dear Milly. Sweet Milly. His wife. She was safely home in Magda tending to their two little ones. It brings a small level of comfort for a brief moment, but his military training soon takes over. The enemy is near. Focus on the present. A soldier with a wandering mind is as good as dead. The others around him wear stoic expressions, although Erikkson knows they are feeling the same. For many, it\u2019s their first tour as well.\n\nOne moment he\u2019s lost in his thoughts, the next the feather of his arrow is tickling his cheek. The command\u2019s been issued, and subconsciously, PFC Erikkson follows in perfect unison with the others. In a single motion, no stragglers, his officer barks his orders, raising one arm simultaneously, the archers along the ramparts drawing their bows as one. The officer\u2019s hand drops down. The arrows let loose.\n\nFor a moment, Erikkson loses sight of the Blackbird warriors. A sea of arrows fill his vision, a stormy wave bringing eminent death. Upon the wave\u2019s subsiding, Erikkson startles. Where there should have been a clearing filled with Blackbird dead bodies, instead, is just a clearing filled with Blackbird warriors, very much still living. They don\u2019t seem affected by the barrage of arrows. Still, they press on.\n\nFrom the edge of the treeline, the ones where Magda soldiers hadn\u2019t cut yet, a different sort of native appears. It\u2019s a small group, dressed in dark robes, fully-hooded, complete with carved wooden staves. They casually walk forward, like the way an elder would rise from an armchair to stoke the fireplace. Before Erikkson can give them a second thought, commands are barked. His officer's hand raises, and Erikkson draws another arrow.", "action_results": [{"action": "The war party", "result": "Invaders.

Some of his people, the Harri\u2019ar, carved such horses for themselves, canoes of tremendous size. Their ambition is--was--their downfall. The Raven brings content; they paid for their blasphemy.\n\nLike the trespassers soon will.

With the company free, tearing through eight surprised soldiers of Magda will be no problem. You\u2019ve seen how deadly the company can be.

As the group travels through an especially thick section, you act, suddenly turning on the soldiers marching behind you. The first one\u2019s breastplate makes a perfect kicking target. You push the sole of your foot out, stamping it onto the breastplate, leaving behind a dirty imprint of your boot. Unprepared for the assault, he staggers back into the waiting arms of Bastus.

It can be wielded with one or both hands. You opt for both.\n\nYou take the offensive, knowing that you can\u2019t afford to engage with a single man longer than necessary. The trick to fighting outnumbered is to strike hard and fast. Take down each as soon as possible before being overwhelmed. It requires aggression. It requires the ferocity of a caged animal. You swing low, then prod the blade forward looking for holes in Benjamin\u2019s defenses. He raises the hand buckler expertly, deflecting each swing of your sword.

You switch from quick prods and thrusts to full-blown swings and life-ending attempts, knowing that you must drop the man in front of you soon.\n\nEach successful defense grows the smile on Benjamin\u2019s face. You\u2019re both thinking the same thing. The end is near. It causes you to slash with the longsword, perhaps a bit more recklessly than your disciplined training would have liked.

Fortunately, the Alteran version of the weapon helps in that regard.\n\nRather than stuffing bullets down the barrel, your finger finds a switch to the outside of the weapon, in-between the trigger and safety. The flintlock hinges open, the barrel angling down towards the dirt, revealing the open chamber. You pop two bullets in, taken from the ammunition at your belt, and snap the weapon closed with a jerk of your hand upwards. A feeding mechanism within the gun automatically refreshes the gunpowder needed, considering the compartment holds ample volume. The days of an infantryman carrying loose gunpowder are long in the past.\n\nYour eyes draw to the man\u2019s forehead. It becomes your entire focus. The target.

Frustrated as the set up was perfect, you cock back the hammer.

The thought of one brings the dried meat back to its original tough, bland flavor.\n\n\u201cDid you ever hear the story of the-then High Prince and the Siege of Hayward?\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar tale, as most are revolving around the High King\u2019s glory, though not often do stories of his past are told. There\u2019s a certain stigma attached to referring to the High King as anything but, as if he was born with the crown upon his head. He was born with a crown, just not the crown. You have not heard the tale in many years. Lionel quickly corrects that fact.\n\nThe town of Hayward rested in the comfortable arms of the Proxa Mountain Range. And that\u2019s not to say it lied at the very bottom. Do arms reach to the very floor? No. Hayward settled midway up the range\u2019s peaks. Twisting, winding, roads led to Hayward. To be more accurate, one road led in, and one led out. You see, Hayward was built with the efficiency of a blacksmith. A man was designated to smelt, another to hammer, another to fan the flame. That sort of thing. Hayward\u2019s wealth was in that realm, too. They are miners, with strength like that of a war horse. Long before the day began, Hayward\u2019s citizens journeyed into the mines. Only long after the day ended would they remerge.\n\nOn the single road goods were imported. New pickaxes, food, that sort of thing. And the export, of course, was ore. Hayward steel was finer than any other. Sturdy. The farthest thing from brittle. A military supported by Hayward steel was a dangerous one. The people of Hayward provided it to Alteran. But they also provided it to his enemies. You see, Hayward was neutral by choice. Their town is far enough away from others that they believe the struggle between Alteran and her enemies did not affect them.\n\nA grave mistake. A deadly mistake. A last mistake.\n\nHayward\u2019s treason was clearly discovered. The High Prince discovered it almost immediately. When the bodies of your fallen enemies grip the same sword that\u2019s strapped at your waist, the source is clear. Treason must be dealt with, else it spreads to others. Treason is like the soft words whispered into your ear by a lover. It was the High Prince\u2019s duty to silence such whispers for the protection of Alteran and her citizens.\n\nSo he marched on Hayward. Up the mountains, through the winding path, he marched with a single battalion. The elements tried to stop the prince. Gusts of wind, threatening to throw the battalion down the mountainside, opposed him. On the third day, a hailstorm poured down atop the battalion, slowing their movement to but a walk, the kind an injured man makes when reaching for his crutches. Not even the elements could stop our would-be High King. You see, not even the elements proved a challenge for the man.\n\nHayward ahead, sheer mountainside at his back, the High Prince took the town by storm. The elements could not stop him. They bent to his will. Most ran to their mines to hide from the prince\u2019s wrath. Those who did not were cut down, justice brought about swiftly. Still, the majority of the Hayward people took to the mines. They sought to escape their sentence. The High Prince, waving off the battalion, followed them into the mines. Alone.\n\nDarkness abounded, traveling through unfamiliar territory, the High Prince hunted down each citizen of Hayward. They set traps. They ambushed. They could not fell our King. For three days the prince navigated the mines. Three days later he emerged, covered head to toe in soot, sweat, and blood.

Training dummies line the far side wall, their arms holding a practice sword and small buckler. The ground is dirt, something that would never pass for a training room in Alteran. No, the rooms, much like the soldiers themselves, are to be kept clean and pristine.\n\nBesides the floor catching your eye, another detail is a close second. It\u2019s empty. Not a soul is present. There is no instructor shouting commands in a gruff voice, insulting poor technique with ease. No devoted soldier looking to get extra time in. There\u2019s not even a bored-looking soldier meant to keep an eye on things. It\u2019s just you, the dirt, and the dummies welcoming you in as one of their own. If they want it, you\u2019ll give it.\n\nYou remove your longsword from its sheath, running from right shoulder to left hip. Most would abandon the sheath along with the sword itself, but an old combat mentor taught you to train with it present. What? You gonna fight without it on your back too? The answer\u2019s no in most cases, and plus, it will only help you move with greater ease when the sheath doesn\u2019t rest on your back. Win-win. It was a hindrance at first, but now it\u2019s normal, like training with heavy armor on.\n\nYou begin to flow through the forms of sword mastery, starting with small basic movements, keeping strong and steady footwork. The feet are the base, the foundation of every position. If you skimp on the foundation, then the entire structure collapses. It may not be the most exciting thing--it\u2019s definitely not the most flashy--but it\u2019s by far the most important. Sword dancing may make for a fine show for drunk patrons at the local tavern; a real fighter knows it has little place for actual combat. Besides exhausting great amounts of energy, it only directly applies to single-opponent skirmishes. On a real battlefield, sword technique must be efficient. It must be deliberate. It must be deadly.\n\nYou lose yourself to the moment and to the forms, the flow state.\n\nThe technique reigns supreme.\n\nYou are simply the conduit.", "action_results": [null]}]}, null]}]}, null]}]}]}, null]}, null, null]}]}]}]}]}, null]}]}]}]}
