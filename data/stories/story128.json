The tiny cage you're in is filthy and made of cold iron bars, with only a single cowl of foul smelling, bloody, weevil-infested stew for nourishment, and you groggily look up to view your surroundings.\n\n\nYou are being dragged on top of wheeled cart through a wide grassland, across hills under the light of a full moon. The creatures pulling you are two legged, upright wolf-like creatures with filthy maws caked in dried blood, known as the \"Vargur\". \n\n\nIn the wake of the defeat of the \"Horned God\", the dark sorcerer who had unleashed uncountable monsters on the land, the Vargur Hordes turned from the armies' foot soldiers into scattered tribes lead by Warlords, pillaging, murdering and enslaving members of Unicorn villages. Your village had been the victim of one such raid, and though you managed to escape the initial carnage, the Vargur caught you on the borders. You don't know where they're taking you, but you have heard rumours of the unspeakable things done to Unicorn prisoners in the Vargur mines, far beneath the earth...\n\n\n\"Awake!\" Barks a Vargur, \"The filthy mule is awake!\"\n\n\nYou feel the harsh sting of a whip on your back, and your mind is quickly shaken out of its grogginess.\n\n\nHow do you react?\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Remain silent and passive", "result": "You slump down, defeated. Fighting back isn't going to help your predicament; you might as well accept it as painlessly as possible. You hear the cackle of your captors, a sound akin to the laughter-like call of Hyneas from the Zebra lands.\n\n\nSuddenly, you feel something grab your back legs. Filthy, ragged claws rake the flesh just above your fetlocks as a Vargur, eyes alight with malice and hunger, pulls you towards him.\n\n\n\"Come to me, mule,\" he snarls, \"I'm sure just a taste won't hurt you...much!\"\n\n\nInstinctively, your horn flares up with an aura of silver telekinetic energy, but it quickly fizzles out; the cold iron bars prevent any magic, especially offensive magic, from being used by anyone inside the cage.\n\n\nAs you prepare for the worst, suddenly, you feel the pulling stop. The Vargur is still holding your legs, but he is frozen in place, an aura of dark blue magic surrounding him. You glance around, and realise this has happened to every Vargur around you; as such, the cart is no longer being pulled. If you strain your ears, you swear you can hear a soft, beautiful song mingled with the mournful howl of the wind.\n\n\n\"Someone's far from home,\" comes a soft, female voice. You look to your right, and see a single, pink unicorn standing there, in the darkness. Her mane is black with a few pink stripes in odd places, and it is perfectly straight, dropping down towards the floor. As is common in Unicorns, though by no means ubiquitous, the aura is the same colour as her eyes; dark blue.\n\n\n\"I'm guessing the Vargur slave mines aren't your chosen holiday destination?\" She says, in the manner of one discussing the weather, \"They certainly wouldn't be mine. Not exactly the most charming of places, but I've seen many that are worse.\"\n\n\n\"Can you get me out of here?\" You plead.\n\n\n\"Oh, you mean break you out of this rusty thing? Of course I can,\" she says.\n\n\n\"And what do you want in return?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, just a small thing,\" she says, brightly, \"I'll need you to do something simple; buy me something very specific. I'll provide you with all the necessary money, of course, but after that, consider your debt paid.\"\n\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Refuse the deal", "result": "The mysterious Unicorn shrugs.\n\n\n\"No matter,\" she says, \"I'll find someone else. There are plenty of helpless prisoners trapped around here.\"\n\n\nAfter a hellish journey, you finally reach the entrance of the Vargur Mines. A bottomless hole with a path leading to nothing but darkness.\n\n\n\"Look, mule,\" says one of the Vargur, \"This is fate that awaits all those who try to escape.\"\n\n\nThe crucifixes on the start of the path are decorated in the bodies of unicorns and many other innocent creatures, all hanging there, swaying in the wind.\n\n\nYou are pulled down into the abyss below, the sobs and screams of the slaves mixed in with the laughter and whip-cracking of their Vargur masters.\n\n\nYou don't last long in the mines. You manage to extract around 40-50 glittering crystals and gems before collapsing from the exhaustion and the beatings. As you expire in your sleep, you dream of that unicorn who you rejected months ago. The last words you hear, with the same casual tone as before, are \"Looks like you probably should have taken that deal, right?\"", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Accept the deal", "result": "You desperately accept. The unicorn nods, and with a flash of light, the she vanishes. The Vargur holding you is freed, and for a moment you think he is about to eat you, but you look closer and see a huge gash surrounded by a dark blue glow, all the way down his chest. He collapses, and falls to the floor, yelping and screaming, unsuccessfully trying to stem the tide gushing from his body...\n\n\nYour surroundings disappear. You reappear in an empty City square, surrounded by tall, dark buidings. You're at the Capital of the Old Unicorn Lands; where you always wanted to be.\n\n\nIt began as a whispered legend when you were a foal; the largest structure on the planet that was the envy and desire even of the very Sun and the Moon. You never quite believed it, so to see it here is breathtaking to say the least.\n\n\n\"Well, with that unpleaseantness out of the way,\" says the melodious voice of your Mysterious Saviour, \"It's about time I introduced myself; my name is Eris Gleam.\"\n\n\n\"Well,\" you say, carefully, \"I'm grateful that you rescued me-\"\n\n\"Ah, well that brings us to your part of our arrangement,\" interrupts Eris. She produces a sack of gold coins, out of thin air, \"Take these, and go into the Alchemy Shop named \"Potions and Powders\". There you must ask for \"Item number 87\"-you will find the gold I gave you is quite enough to cover it, and I've even provided a little extra just for you, as thanks for your help. I can't get it myself; my powers far exceed anyone elses, and they scare the other unicorns. They call me a \"Witch\", and if I ever went near them they'd probably tie me up and sell me.\"\n\n\nYou take the gold pouch, and she smiles.\n\n\n\"Go on now,\" she says. Her smile does not vanish, but her voice suddenly takes on a chillier tone, \"Oh, and please don't think about running away with the money when I'm not looking. I would hate it I had to teleport you back to where you came from...\".\n\n\nYou tentatively enter the shop. The shelves are stacked high with ancient artefacts; a skull with glowing green eyes stares down at you, following your every action. Potions bubble and froth, some of them making sounds that resemble soft cries for help. You speed up just a bit, and get to the counter in the centre of the room.\n\n\nAn old, wizened grey unicorn alchemist sits on the counter, seemingly asleep, but wakes up the moment you get near him.\n\n\n\"What do you want?\" he ask, with a bored tone.\n\n\n\"I was told to order \"Item 87\", \" You say, and toss the pouch to the alchemist. He looks intrigued, and counts out 20 coins, before returning a single gold coin to you.\n\n\n\"This way,\" he says, taking keys from under his desk.\n\n\nHe leads you down a corridor to a massive, metal door at the end. He inserts a great black key into the lock, and opens it with a creak. He levitates a glass box containing two vials of powers. One vial contains a powder white as snow; the other, as black as volcanic ash.\n\n\n\"Now,\" says the alchemist, \"The order instructions say that anyone who purchases this must inhale one of these two powders.\"\n\n\"W-what?\" you ask. You never agreed to inhaling stange dust!\n\n\n\"I didn't write the rules,\" explains the alchemist, \"But the order clearly states that, if you want it, you have to take one or the other. Don't know why, don't care, but do you want the box or not?\"\n\n\nYou gulp. You don't want to take these strange substances,which are very likely illegal, but you don't want to go back to the Vargur jail cell either. You take a closer look at the vials; the black one is labelled \"Ashes of the future\", and the white is labelled \"Sugar of the past\". Which do you take?", "action_results": [{"action": "Ashes of the future", "result": "You point to the black dust, and the alchemist offers it to you. You uncork the vial and place as small a sample as you can on your hoof, before placing the hoof under your snout and inhaling the meagre substance.\n\n\nFor a moment, nothing feels different. Then, the world starts shaking, and you look down to realise it's not the world, but your legs. You collapse onto the floor, and hear the alchemist laugh. Your vision is filled with darkness, and your eyes begin to roll back...\n\n\nYou are in the fields that the Vargur dragged you across in their cart. You take a hoofstep forward, and the ground and grass begins to ripple, and if you had disturbed a still pool. The ripple becomes a wave, and the whole hill lurches forward. You look into the sky; it is filled with whales, one of them suddenly turning into a bowl of flowers, before hitting the ground and smashing.The pot oozes with blood as the flowers wilt and die.\n\n\nA low, deep, vibrating sound fills the air. At first, you think it may be a growl, but you quickly realise it is a chuckle...\n\n\nThe alchemist's shop comes back into view. Your head is still on the floor, in a pool of your own saliva and sweat, and you're still trembling. You wait a few minutes, before getting back on your more or less stable legs.\n\n\nThe alchemist grins.\n\n\n\"Well, looks like the box is yours!\" he says, handing it to you, then trots back to his desk.\n\n\nYou realise you have one gold coin left, and that this is likely the only shop open. Do you wish to buy something or leave the shop?\n\n\nAs you make your decision, you look around, and see the options you have for one gold coin:\n\n\n \n\n-A Bezor of the Glatisunt- taking this stone will cure you of any toxin or illness.\n\n\n-One dose of 'Essence of the River' - this potion will allow you to calm even the most savage of beasts", "action_results": [{"action": "Buy nothing", "result": "You trust nothing of this place, and charge out of the door without even a goodbye.\n\n\nEris is waiting for you, a look of concern on your face.\n\n\n\"Are you alright?\" she asks, \"Did something happen?\" and you tell her of what happened.\n\n\nWhen you finish your story, she looks aghast, and you feel her magic caress away the saliva on your face.\n\n\n\"What an awful thing to do!\" she gasps, \"He wanted to see the effects of the dust, so he tested it on you, and as if that wasn't enough, he actually told you that he wouldn't let you buy it otherwise? I would never have asked you to do this had I known! Those visions can drive folk to madness...do you want to talk about it? If you tell me what you saw, I might be able to help.\"\n\n\nYou explain the vision, and Eris' face morphs from sympathetic to terrified.\n\n\n\"The dust acts as a warning,\" says Eris, \"A warning of things to come. What you saw was my greatest terror...the Unravelling is coming.\"\n\n\n\"The Unravelling?\" you ask, but Eris is no longer looking at you. She mutters somthing under her breath, to the tune of a nursery rhyme:\n\n\n\"Do not seek the edges of the world, for fragile is its binding,\n\n\nBut if you grab hold of it and pull, you shall see reality unwinding.\"\n\n\n\"What does it mean?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"The universe is set up with rules,\" explains Eris, \"There's a reason why, for example, we don't randomly float into the sky, or why you can't havea square circle. These rules can't be broken, and so the world functions as it should. The Unravelling, however, changes that. It is said that something or someone will cause an event that will suspend all known laws of reality, and the universe will be plunged into a state worse than non-existence; a world where nothing can be known for certain, and where reality is reduced to a meaningless sea of nonsense.\"\n\n\n\"How can you stop it?\" you ask, the blood thunders through your chest and the sound seems loud as a thunderstorm in the silent City night.\n\n\nEris looks at you, sadly.\n\n\n\"I know of a way,\" she says, \"But I can't do it alone.\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\" You ask, \"You have powers greater than anyone I've ever met, greater than anything I've even thought possible.\"\n\nEris smiles sadly.\n\n\n\"Oh, I'm not that special,\" she says, but she still sounds happy at your statement, \"And power isn't the answer to everything. If I tried out my plan, many of the unicorns involved would likely try to kill me, and I would be forced to defend myself. And there's nothing in this world I would want to do less than hurt other Ponies. No, if I am to do this, I would need the help of another unicorn, brave and kind. You no longer owe me anything, so you are free to do as you will.\" She looks down at the ground, and her bottom lip wobbles a little, \"It was nice to have met you,\" she sounds unusally subdued and quiet, \"Well, goodbye, my friend.\" And she turns to go.\n\n\nYou think of the vision you saw in the shop. Of how the world will descend into nonsense if you don't help. Then, almost outside your own volition, you hear your voice say\n\n\n\"I'll do it.\"\n\n\nShe turns around looks at you, both surprised and proud.\n\n\n\"You'll help me?\" she says, galloping towards you and beaming, \"That's wonderful!\" She rumages around in her bag, and pulls out a small, grey gem that reflects you and Eris, but nothing else.\n\n\n\"Do you know what this is?\" she asks.", "action_results": [{"action": "No", "result": "\"This,\" Eris explains, \"Is what is known as a 'Keystone of Reality', or more technically a \"Quantized Time Crystal\". After much searching of ancient libraries and museums, I managed to aquire it. It has the ability to remain in a perfect and repeating state, and when fully powered, it will be powerful enough to reverse any magic or even damage done to the laws of the universe.\"\n\n\n\"And how does one power it?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"That's the problem,\" admits Eris, \"There's only one known way to power it; a pathway through the Snow and Ice of the Northern Mountains is watched over by a set of guardians. Approaching the areas these guardians live, then talking with anyone who lives there, will allow you to power the Keystone, for the Keystone is powered by virtue, and the guardians are some of the most virtuous beings around. I'd do it myself, but they would recognise my power immediately and I fear they might kill me, merely because they think that no being should be this magically attuned.\"\n\n\n\"Alright,\" you say, \"I'll do it.\"\n\n\n\"I'll teleport you when you're ready,\" says Eris, with a warm smile.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ready...", "result": "Just as Eris is about to cast her spell, there is a movement in the corner of your vision.\n\n\n\"Spare change?\" A ragged unicorn, with clothing barely more than rags, hobbles up to you. His horn is bent, and he can barely use the tiny amount of magic he has left to hold up the cup he is holding.\n\n\n\"Leave us,\" says Eris, quietly. The unicorn pays no heed, and trots up to you.\n\n\n\"Please, I have kids, the Wars left me a cripple...\"\n\n\n\"I don't have anything-\" you begin, but the Unicorn doesn't back down.\n\n\n\"You have!\" he cries, \"You have!\" He is mere centimeters away from your face. Suddenly, he stops, and collapses to the floor. He begins trembling, his eyes shut, tears streaming down his face. You look closely and see his head encased in a dark blue glow. Eris' magic.\n\n\n\"Now,\" she says, her voice trembling, \"Begone. Or I will do inflict upon you things that will make the visions you see right now look like paradise in comparison.\" The Unicorn backs away into the darkness, whimpering. You look at Eris' face, an see a strange glint in her eye. But you suddenly realise that must have been the light of the full moon, for when you take a closer look, you see her look truly distraught. \n\n\n\"I hate myself, sometimes,\" she says, bitterly, \"But we can't allow ourselves to be slowed down right now. And,\" her voice quietens, \"I was worried you were in danger.\" Suddenly, her horn glows , and both of you are enveloped by a blue flash.\n\n\nThe City vanishes, and is replaced by a freezing cold mountain path. Snow blankets the ground and flakes fall through the air. You shiver at the intense temperature. Suddenly, the pink and black mane of Eris pops into view, and she is wearing a huge, thick coat.\n\n\n\"Sorry,\" she says, \"Should have given you something to keep warm, huh?\"\n\n\nA dark blue aura surrounds you, and it is like you have been suddenly placed into a warm bath. A warm jacket, lined with the softest velvet, appears on you, and with that, Eris removes her magic.\n\n\n\"Better?\"\n\n\nYou nod, gratefully.\n\n\n\"Walk with me until we reach the first Cave,\" says Eris, \"I think we have time for a short conversation.\"\n\n\nYou may ask Eris about a single topic. What do you ask?", "action_results": [{"action": "Ask her nothing", "result": "After a long walk, you reach the path leading towards first cave. \n\n\n\"You must go forward alone,\" Eris says, \"Don't worry; I'll teleport to the end, and I'll be waiting for you. I have every confidence that you will succeed.\" She disappears in a flash.\n\n\nYou continue up the path, but you find it difficult to see anything through the snow. You carry on forwards, hoping that you did not miss the path. The warmth of your coat certainly helps with the blizzard, though your face and hooves are extremely cold. Using a tiny bit of your magic, you keep them warm; it feels as if a candle is being held near your face. Hypothetically, you could try and use magic to keep yourself much warmer, but using your magic on living things is always more difficult than on inanimate objects; keeping yourself even somewhat warm for more than a few seconds without losing your powers altogether would be a task even the highest level Unicorns would struggle with, though they might be able to pull off. You are most certainly not the highest level Unicorn.\n\n\nSoon, you see a cave up ahead. The cave lies on the other side of a wide gap, and at the bottom, an icy-blue river.\n\n\nIn the cave, you see a dark brown Unicorn stallion, apparently awaiting your arrival. You need to find a way across to continue going on the path.\n\n\n\"Jump across the gap!\" He cries, \"Don't worry, I'll use my magic to catch you! Just jump!\"\n\n\nWhat do you do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Don't jump", "result": "You don't trust the stallion to keep his word.\n\n\n\"Who exactly are you?\" You ask, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\nThe unicorn smiles.\n\n\n\"Why, I am the \"Guardian of Truth\" of course! Which mean I truly guard whatever treasure you have come seeking, whether it be gold or jewels!\"\n\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. You aren't convinced this slippery Unicorn is the Guardian of The Truth. In fact, you heavily suspect that what remains the real Guardian Of Truth is several hundred metres below you...\n\n\nWhat do you do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell him that you came here in order to power a gem and save the world", "result": "The stallion stops for a moment.\n\n\n\u201cYou told the truth?\u201d Asks the stallion, \u201cYou\u2019re taking a huge risk, especially since you know you can\u2019t trust me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re not trustworthy doesn\u2019t mean I should follow your example,\u201d you retort, \u201cLook where that has helped you end up; stuck in a Cave.\"\n\n\nThe stallion pauses for a moment.\n\n\n\"Why should I bother to help you?\" he says, doubtfully, \"I'll just end up stuck here forever, either way.\"\n\n\n\"If you killed the Guardian of Truth, maybe the role passes down on to you,\" you say, \"Lying doesn't seem to have helped you out, maybe telling the truth will \"break the curse\" and free you.\"\n\n\"Seems unlikely...\" says the stallion,\n\n\n\"Might as well try?\" you plead, \"No time like the present!\"\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me up here, there\u2019s no way back.

Look where I ended up.\u201d\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure whether you believe him, but you give him the benefit of the doubt. You don\u2019t really have any other choice.\n\n\n \n\nAfter you have left, a rumbling sounds from above the cave entrance. A boulder tumbles down, and is caught in mid-air by a magic, light blue aura. The brown stallion places the boulder over the gap, and tentatively trots across, free at last.

The purple mare holds a huge, white beast on the end of a chain. It is an ape-like, bipedal creature known as a 'Yeti' and Its mouth is filled with blood, and you catch a glimpse of a unicorn horn sticking out of its teeth.

That was the day that ruined my life, and the reason I left the company of others forever and hoped to find answers here. Yet the vines were too clever even for me. The memory of me losing my horn was brought back, but instead of mocking me, the other Unicorns sympathised with me. They told me that losing my horn didn't make me worth any less, and they even all got together to buy me a hat that would disguise the loss of my horn. And Midnight, the pretty mare I had been too shy to talk to, spoke to me and told me how she always had really liked me.

The laws of logic, too, were set out in this way; married bachelors cannot exist, and nor can a four sided triangle exist.\n\n\n \n\nThese rules were kept in place by objects known as \"Keystones\", or \"Time Crystals\" ; gemstones arranged in such a perfect order that they could remain in their forms forever, outlasting even matter and energy itself, therefore allowing the rules that make up the universe to last eternally.
