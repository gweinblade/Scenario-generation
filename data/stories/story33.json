She\u2019d be dead before he even left his town if he waited for the boat. Elliot only had one choice: take a three day walk through the forest of past voices. He shuddered at the idea, the forest was known for being haunted and had taken more lives than it had spared.

Luckily, the opening was just low enough for him to jump and grab the ledge with his hands and pull himself up. He entered the cave, wishing he had something for light. He silently prayed that no bear lived in the cave. He didn't go far in, just far enough for him to be protected from the elements and hopefully any supernatural beings presiding in the forest.\n\n\nThe tired man placed his head on a smooth rock, using it as a pillow and let himself fall into a stressed sleep. He woke up not long after, warmer than he had been since summer. Not opening his eyes, he attempted to roll over and bask in the warmth but that was when he realized, he couldn't move. His eyes snapped open. He was tightly wrapped in a womb of feathers. He let out a bloodcurdling scream, thinking he'd been tar and feathered. Elliot had seen people being tar and feathered, and it was something he hoped he would never have to endure.\n\n\nA deep, raspy voice replied, \"what's wrong with you, human?\" \n\n\n\"Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!\"\n\n\n\"You don't know who I am?\" The voice sounded offended.\n\n\nSuddenly, the feathers left the man and he saw what had been happening. He saw the most vile monster he'd ever seen in front of him. \"You...you're a...you...you're...YOU'RE A GIANT DUCK\" Elliot yelled at the beast. \n\n\n\"I am no duck!\" Said the giant duck, \"I am a fire drake.\" The offended beast was a pure feathered mallard and was as big as a dragon. \n\n\n\"Oh please, a fire drake is just an old timey name for a dragon and you my friend, are no dragon.\"\n\n\n\"How dare you?! I am not a dragon, I am a fire drake. Those damn dragons have all but destroyed my beautiful image and memory.\" \n\n\n\"What? I'm just,\" Elliot gasped for breath, \"what do you want from me? Also, were you...sitting on me?\" \n\n\n\"How else was I supposed to keep you warm? I like my food nice and toasty before I eat it. I also like to play with my food before I eat it, but you're annoying.\"\n\n\n\"Aren't ducks vegetarians?\" \n\n\n\"I already said I'm not a duck!

I\u2019m very interested.\u201d\n\n\nThe fire drake, not recognizing sarcasm, seemed utterly delighted to be asked such a question. \u201cWell it all started when dragons were invented, I mean discovered, yes, discovered. They were all the rage back then! China had dragons, France had dragons, Germany had dragons, even Israel had dragons.\u201d Elliot had no idea where or what any of these places were but decided to keep his mouth shut.\n\n\nThe duck continued, \u201cEventually, the idea of dragons was brought to England, and they were called fire drakes. \u2018Fire\u2019 because they were fire breathing and \u2018drake\u2019 because it was derived from the Latin word \u2018draco\u2019 meaning serpent.  The only problem was that England already had a definition for the word \u2018drake.\u2019 Drake means male duck. This led to much confusion and my birth.\u201d He gave a wistful expression. \u201cOnce upon a time, I was a funny punchline, a great pun. People would say duck and think dragon or say dragon and think duck. People who read Beowulf would laugh while they thought of me saying, \u2018what if Beowulf actually fought a giant duck? Oh how funny that would be.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nHis tone changed, \"But then, little by little, people started referring to fire drakes as dragons. No longer would they think of a duck as a giant serpent. Then, the word drake fell out of fashion entirely. All that is left of me is in this forest. For oh, for oh, the fire drake is forgot.\u201d\n\n\nElliot had never been so bored or so confused by a speech in his entire life, but he clapped anyways, trying to spare his life. \u201cPoor fire drake, I\u2019m sure it must have been very hard for you, for people to stop making puns at your expense.\u201d\n\n\nThe duck somehow produced a tear from his giant eye. \u201cIt was so hard. Now I have to live in this forest of the dead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor-forest of the dead?\u201d The man\u2019s heart pounded in his chest and a shiver worked its way down his spine.\n\n\n\u201cWell duh! I\u2019m dead, you idiot! I just told you that whole story about how I faded from existence and you didn\u2019t even know that? You\u2019re probably the only living creature in this forest! Even the trees are ghosts of trees who were cut down or died in some other way.\"\n\n\nElliot\u2019s heart almost stopped. His eyes went wide and his feet started itching. Itching to get the hell out of this forest, that is.\n\n\nThe mallard almost seemed to feel sorry for him. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m the only fire drake pun in the whole forest. Then again, I\u2019m the only one to ever exist. Point is, not everything\u2019s going to try to burn you and eat you. There are nice ghosts out there.\u201d\n\n\nElliot sniffled, there was something he just didn\u2019t like about the undead. A fire drake was one thing, but the GHOST of a fire drake was totally different. The more he thought about it, the more tears sprang to his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to be here with all these ghosts.\n\n\nHe had to get out of here. If nothing else, Elliot knew he had to get out of this forest. But first, he had to get past that pesky duck. An idea suddenly struck him. He knew the fire drake was stupid, but would it be stupid enough to fall for...? \"I got it!\" Thought the man to himself. He grabbed his pack of matches, struck one and put it in his mouth. \"Hey look, I can breathe fire, too!\"\n\n\nThe fire drake opened his beak in shock. \"Oh. My. Gosh. I see you have mastered this beautiful art, just as I did as a small duckling.\"\n\n\nElliot took the match out of his mouth and blew it out. The duck continued, \"I'll tell you what. I'll let you live. No buts, I insist. Also, for a fellow fire master, I'll even give you one of my feathers, they have the power to cure any illness. You can give it to your aunt when you see her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow did you know about Rosy?\u201d\n\n\n\"I\u2019m the punchline of a joke, a creature that never really existed.

That way, he could stay warm, be able to have a source of light, and not have to worry about bears in caves.  He started by gathering kindling: twigs, sticks, and logs. Then he gathered rocks and organized them to make a homemade fire pit. Once he built a perfect tipi shape out of twigs, he lit one of his matches and began building his fire with larger and larger kindling. Before the sun set, a large fire was cackling away while the man tended it. \n\n\nHe was tired and made the decision to throw in the rest of the firewood he gathered and go to sleep. He would've tried to wake up every once in a while go keep the fire going, but Elliot was known for being able to sleep through almost anything. He figured if he went to bed by the fire, it would last long enough for him to fall into a deep sleep and would fizzle out sometime in the night. \n\n\nHe closed his eyes and prepared for a long night of rest, but before sleep took him away, a noise that most certainly was not from a fire caught his attention. It sounded...human. The man snapped his eyes open, and what he saw before him made his stomach fall to his feet. Next to Elliot was Old Man Doug tending the fire.

Doug screamed as the flames engulfed him. It was the second time he had been consumed by flames and also the second time Elliot had been at fault. He hadn't meant for the fire to burn down the old man's house. He certainly hadn't meant for anyone to die. But all the same, when Elliot was 10 years old, he killed Old Man Doug.\n\n\nHowever, this time was going to be different. This time, Doug had the upper hand: he was already dead so fire couldn't kill him. The old man lunged out of the fire and grabbed Elliot by the collar of his shirt. Once he had a firm grip, he dragged the terrified man towards the fire and with supernatural strength, tossed him into the hungry flames.

He closed his eyes again, and tried to fall asleep. Despite his efforts, he couldn't relax, let alone sleep. He kept opening his eyes to see if Old Man Doug had disappeared yet, but the ghost never seemed to leave. He just kept tending the fire, never even stealing a glance behind him to see if Elliot was aware of his presence. Tense hours passed, neither of them moving except for Doug occasionally adding more wood to the fire.\n\n\nElliot kept having flashbacks to the night Old Man Doug died. It was the worst day of his life. His father's continuous abuse led the 10 year old Elliot to rebel whenever possible. That fateful night, he had snuck out once his father and sister were asleep. The boy then snuck over to his next door neighbor, Old Man Doug's yard and began playing with matches. He'd light one and let it burn as long as he could without burning himself then, just as the flame began to reach his hand, he'd drop the match on the ground. What Elliot didn't know was that the grass was as dry as a desert that summer, and one of the lighted matches lit a blade on fire. The fire spread quickly as the boy watched in horror. It wasn't long until the fire reached Doug's house and quickly lit the little wood building on fire. Elliot could still hear the screams of the dying man as he tried to escape the flames. Nobody ever found out how the fire started. He never told a soul.\n\n\nBut now, fifteen years later, there was Old Man Doug, the man he killed with flames, tending his campfire. Elliot didn't get a wink of sleep, he just kept thinking back to that night and wave after wave of guilt passed over him. He watched the ghost for many parts of the night, but never spoke a word to him out of fear. Finally, the first rays of dawn pushed their way through the canopy of trees and onto the the makeshift camp. \n\n\nOld Man Doug, for the first time all night, turned to face Elliot, whose eyes were wide open.

But...it grew too quickly.\"\n\n\n\"Oh please, you never liked me enough to do anything like that! I was just the town grump.\"\n\n\nElliot silently pulled up his shirt, revealing the scars all up and down his midsection.

I'm-I-I-I...I'm so sorry. Words can't even describe how guilty I feel.\"\n\n\nDoug was silent a long time, thinking over what Elliot said.

He looked down at his body, expecting to see charred remains of himself, but rather, he didn't have a burn on him. Even his clothes survived unscathed. \n\n\n\"Wha-wha-what? How am I not dead?\"\n\n\nDoug replied, \"I didn't want to kill you, just make you feel the same pain I did. I spared your life; you better be grateful. Goodbye forever, Elliot.\"\n\n\nThe ghost disappeared into thin air and a confused man continued his trek across the forest. It was still early morning and despite the ordeal he had to go through, Elliot was glad he had an early start on the hike so he could get farther faster. The man hiked all day, using a compass to always head North, towards Gregory Village, where Aunt Rosy lived.\n\n\nWhen light was beginning to fall, Elliot knew he had to stop for the night.

With a final smile of triumph, he fell into a light sleep.\n\n\nHe suddenly found himself in his childhood home, eating breakfast with his father and little sister, Jessie. He looked down at his bowl; it was porridge topped with berries in the shape of a smiley face. Elliot's father pushed back his dirty blonde hair while laughing at one of Jessie's jokes.

He knew he still had to leave her, but it wouldn't hurt to give her one thing as a parting gift. \n\n\nThe man found another small patch of daisies five steps away and plucked a handful of them. Turning around, Jessie was found frozen to the spot with a waterfall of salty tears pouring from her eyes. He walked up to her, daisies in hand and placed the bouquet at her feet. Giving her one final goodbye, he walked away for the last time, knowing he'd see her again, perhaps in this very forest. But to comfort himself, he decided her grave would be the second thing he did when he got to Gregory Village, where Rosy and his childhood home were.\n\n\nHe walked and walked and walked and walked and walked. He only stopped to let nature take its course and to eat or drink. Elliot knew that if he was quick, the forest, and his guilt, would be behind him by nightfall. When dusk was just beginning to arrive, he exited the forest for the first time in almost three days. The man reveled in the fact that he made it just ahead of schedule. His only hope was that he actually made it to Gregory Village and not some nearby township. \n\n\nAfter walking a little bit beside the nearby huts and small homes, he began to recognize it as truly Gregory Village.

Rosy's bed was at the far end of the one room hut and the man quickly rushed to her side. \n\n\nUncle Mark was sitting on her left, holding her hand as she slept and Elliot plopped himself down on her right so as not to interfere with him. \n\n\n\"I'm glad you made it.\" \n\n\n\"So am I. How's she been?\"\n\n\n\"She doesn't have more than a few hours left. I want her to stay longer but...she's in so much pain. Being alive is just suffering for her. I-I-I suppose the faster she goes, the better.\" He started to chuckle despite the look of immense pain in his eyes. \"I bet she has to go soon so that she can see little Jessie. She always loved that girl.\"\n\n\nElliot chose not to tell Mark that he had seen Jessie that morning and broken her dead heart. \n\n\nAfter a long silence, Mark spoke again, \"Elliot, I don't want her to die. Why can't I die instead? I'm older, I've done horrible things in my life and she, she's always been so kind to everyone. She doesn't deserve this. She deserves to live forever.\"\n\n\nThe younger man thought a moment. \"Maybe...He,\" Elliot pointed up, \"He takes the good ones first because they don't deserve to have to go through this. Maybe it's just us bad people who have to take on this grief.\"\n\n\nThe two men sat in silence, awaiting Rosy to wake up so they could say goodbye. I wish I could say she woke up and everyone got to tell each other how much they love each other. I wish I could say that, but Rosy never woke up. She died in her sleep, during a dream about daisies.

He walked forward, with fear in his heart but a feather in his pocket. \"I'm doing this for Rosy; I'm doing this for Rosy,\" he repeated over and over to himself, trying to stay optimistic. He walked for hours and hours, stopping periodically to eat or rest. \n\n\nWhen dusk started approaching, he began his search for another cave to sleep in, because he's not the type to learn his lesson the first time around. He just had an affinity for caves despite the whole fire drake incident. After looking for a cave for a few minutes, he finally spotted one in the distance and began walking towards it. Elliot was almost at the entrance when *WHACK* everything went black.\n\n\nWhen he woke back up, he was laying on his back in a bed of moss on the forest floor. Rays of light were seeping through the dense trees overhead. He groaned as he touched his throbbing head. Elliot noticed that his hair felt...weird. It was dry and flakey. He brought his hand back in front of his face. Red. Oh no. His head had been bleeding. \"What happened?\" He asked aloud, not expecting an answer.\n\n\nA voice replied anyways, \"ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?!\" \n\n\nThe screaming made Elliot's head throb even more and he moaned at the pain. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\n\"MY NAME IS BIRCH, AND YOU BETTER REMEMBER IT!\" The loud angry voice shouted.\n\n\n\"Can you quiet it down a bit? I'm trying to ignore the fact that I'm sleeping on ghost moss.\" He wanted the voice to go away. He couldn't quite tell if it was a real voice or if the hit to the head was making him delusional.\n\n\n\"I'M WHISPERING, YOU HUMAN SCUM! DID I HIT YOU IN THE HEAD TOO HARD OR SOMETHING? HA! FIGURES YOU'D BE SO WEAK!\"\n\n\nElliot sat up, ready to throw a stick at whoever kept yelling while he was trying to sleep. At his feet stood the cutest little man he had ever seen. He was two feet tall, had a long white beard, a pot belly, and a tall pointy hat. \"Aww you're so cute!\" He tried to pinch the little man's cheeks. \n\n\n\"YOU IMBECILE! I'M FROM A PROUD AND DIGNIFIED RACE! WE GNOMES ARE SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER RACES! WE ARE THE EPITOME OF LIFE!\"\n\n\nElliot almost giggled. He had learned about the gnome war in history books. All the gnomes were dead now, they all died in the war. That must be why Birch the gnome was in the forest.\n\n\n\"If you're so great, why'd you all die in the gnome war, huh?\" \n\n\nBirch began kicking Elliot in his calves. It didn't hurt much.\n\n\n\"WE LOST BECAUSE THE HUMANS HAD AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE!\"\n\n\nSuddenly, a whole crowd of gnomes, about 20 of them, came out from behind bushes and trees. One of the female gnomes started, \"stop that, Birch. He's a weak human and we should show him a little compassion. It's the gnome's way.\"\n\n\n\"SHUT IT, POPPY! THE GNOME'S WAY DIED WHEN WE DID!\" Despite his words, Birch stopped kicking the man.\n\n\nElliot was scared to ask, but he did anyways. \"What are you going to do with me?\"\n\n\n\"WHY KILL YOU, OF COURSE!\" \n\n\nPoppy chimed in, \"but painlessly. We are a gentle race, after all.\" She smiled as she said this.\n\n\nElliot's heart raced. He could take one, two, or even three of these guys, but twenty? He was sure this is how he would die. Killed by gnomes long after all the gnomes died. He decided to make a last ditch effort to save himself. \"You know, I actually love gnomes. I totally relate to you guys and gals. If I was alive during the gnome war, I definitely would have sided with you.\"\n\n\nPoppy grinned, \"aww that's so sweet! Why don't we let him live, what do you say, Birch?\"\n\n\n\"NO WAY! HE COULD BE LYING!\"\n\n\nAnother gnome from the back of the crowd added, \"what if we test him to see if he's lying or not?\"\n\n\n\"Great idea!\" Said an ecstatic Poppy.\n\n\n\"YEAH OKAY, WHATEVER!

Very vague, but perfect! I'm amazed you knew about that. I would've thought human propaganda completely destroyed that story...the truth...\"\n\n\nElliot blushed, proud of himself.\n\n\nOne gnome that had been silent up until now stepped forward. \"My name is Basil, I just wanted you to know that those gardens were mine and they were the most beautiful gardens ever created. Gnomes are known for our ability to create art out of plants, but even amongst gnomes, I was always known for my green thumbs.\" He held gave Elliot a double thumbs up and sure enough, both of his thumbs were bright green.\n\n\nBasil continued, \"gnomes, humans, and other more inconsequential creatures used to come from far and wide to gaze upon my gardens. They were my masterpiece, the best gardens ever created! However, the land my gardens were on belonged to a certain Mr. Casey. That horrid old man despised all those people trespassing on his land all the time and told me I had to leave! The nerve of that man! I had no money to buy the land from him and so, I told him I'd do anything if he allowed me to stay. I said I would disallow anyone from visiting the gardens, I swore up and down...but he refused. He told me I had to go. I wouldn't budge, of course, the gardens were my life. When I wouldn't leave, he...he...oh it's just too difficult to talk about!\"\n\n\nBasil ran off into the woods, tears streaming down his tiny, bearded face. Poppy decided that she had to finish the story, though she hadn't been there herself. \"Mr. Casey destroyed the gardens and Basil well he...h-he got a group of friends together and poisoned Mr. Casey. But then humankind saw what the gnomes did to one of their own and gnomekind saw what happened to the most beautiful gardens in the world. Tensions rose quickly and before long, with the help of extreme propaganda on both sides, all out war broke out.\"\n\n\nElliot was stunned. He couldn't believe an entire species went extinct because of the destruction of one gnome's plants being killed. He eyed the large stick Birch was carrying and decided to keep his mouth shut about this one.\n\n\n\"WELL ANYWAY, YOU NOT ONLY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS CORRECTLY BUT ALSO PUT UP WITH POPPY AND THAT TAKES SOME REAL STRENGTH, SO I'LL LET YOU LIVE! NOW GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!\" With a final jab at perhaps the only kind gnome in the world, Birch turned on his heel and left, quickly followed by the others. The only one who stayed behind was Poppy. \n\n\nShe blushed, \"I know you want to get going, but I have something that might help you on your way. If you head immediately East, you'll reach a small patch of snow. When you get there, yell out, 'I hate Nick.' Trust me, you'll thank me later.\" With that, Poppy ran off into the woods to find her companions.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head East", "result": "Elliot decided he had to take Poppy's advice. She had been nothing but kind to him, after all. He grabbed his compass and began walking East. The position of the sun gave away the time of day: most likely around mid morning. Hours passed, the sun now hovered directly overhead and still he walked. More hours passed and it was early afternoon, he kept walking. It seemed the only thing he could do. When the better part of the day was behind him, he began thinking about stopping to rest but just as he was about to, he saw something white in the distance.\n\n\nDeterminations coursed through him as he picked up speed. He practically ran the last little distance to the patch of snow, he was so excited. The first thing he noticed when he was arrived was how serious Poppy was being when she said 'small' patch of snow. The dimensions of the patch couldn't have been an inch more that 10ft by 8ft. It made sense, though. It wasn't really cold enough for snow.\n\n\nElliot stood in the middle of the snow patch, wondering again why he decided to take Poppy's advice. \"This is stupid,\" he thought to himself, \"I walked almost an entire day to this tiny patch of snow. Now it'll take me a day to get back to where I was then another day  and a half to get to Aunt Rosy.\" He cursed himself for coming to the snow patch and wasting time Rosy didn't have. \n\n\nJust as he was falling into complete despair, a caribou appeared on the snow. Elliot smiled at the beast, he couldn't help but feel better when so close to such a magnificent creature. He faintly wondered what a caribou was doing in a forest that only had a tiny patch a snow, then remembered that it must be the ghost of a beast that already died. Somehow, after not being killed by the hostile gnomes, his fear of the undead was numbed. Perhaps not gone completely, but at least gone for the time being. He'd met a couple too many ghosts and not been killed for his fear to take over at this point.\n\n\nThe man admired the ghostly caribou; it walked with a grace that can't be found in mankind except among the elite dancers. What Elliot never expected was for the caribou to talk.\n\n\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Asked the beast.\n\n\nThe man answered through screaming, the only thing he was much good at, it seems. \"YOU-YOU'RE! You're a! A-a-a talking caribou!\"\n\n\n\"How rude of you to say. I am no caribou. I'm a reindeer, you spoiled brat of a man.\" \n\n\nElliot was silent. He faintly wondered why he was always verbally abused by every ghost he met. \"I umm, I...I'm sorry?\"\n\n\nThe reindeer huffed. \"You should be.\"\n\n\nThe two of them stood in awkward silence for a few minutes, each waiting for the other to speak. Finally, Elliot broke the silence, remembering what Poppy told him to say. \"I hate Nick.\"\n\n\nThe reindeer nodded its head, \"So umm, do you like Christmas?\"\n\n\n\"Wha- what? What kind of question is that?\"\n\n\n\"Do. You. Like. Christmas. Have you gotten lots of toys from that fatty, Santa? Does he come every year and grant your every dream at the expense of overworked, unappreciated, and underpaid reindeer?\"\n\n\nElliot paused. He'd never had a Christmas gift in his life. \"I've actually...never been visited by Santa.\"\n\n\nThe reindeer snapped to attention, seemingly happy, though it is hard facial expressions from reindeer. \"Why have you never gotten a present from Santa?\" It asked.", "action_results": [{"action": "Elliot is poor", "result": "\"I've never had a present from Santa because I'm poor.\"\n\n\nThe reindeer laughed, \"yeah, that damn fat bastard really hates poor kids. I think he gets a kick out of giving them the worst gifts or skipping them entirely.\" The caribou turned its head to look behind it, \"HEY GIRLS, GET OUT HERE! OH, AND RUDY CAN COME TOO, I GUESS!\" \n\n\nThe reindeer turned back to face Elliot, all of a sudden super nice, \"by the way, my name's Prancer. What's yours?\" \n\n\nAs the man told Prancer his name, eight other reindeer galloped onto the snow patch. Seven of them looked just like Prancer, but one looked far different. Eight of the reindeer were large, valiant looking creatures with large antlers and a look of determination in their eyes. Yet, the ninth reindeer was scrawny, had no antlers, and had a large, red, glowing nose.\n\n\nElliot addressed the smallest reindeer, \"you must be Rudolph.\" \n\n\nRudolph looked up, \"is it that obvious? I would've thought people forgot about me after I died.\"\n\n\n\"No way would we forget! I've never been visited by Santa, but I saw you on my neighbor's roof once.\"\n\n\nRudolph made a facial contortion that was probably the caribou equivalent to smiling. \n\n\nPrancer interrupted, \"hey so Elliot, what do you need our help with?\"\n\n\nThe man was confused, he never asked for help. Though of course, he would take any he could get. \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\n\"You said our secret password so you obviously know one of our friends. People don't just come visit reindeer. What is it you want from us? We're always willing to help a poor kid; they tend to hate Santa almost as much as us.\"\n\n\nElliot figured the secret password was just what Poppy told him to tell them: 'I hate Nick.' He said, \"All I really want is to get to my Aunt's house as quickly as I can.\"\n\n\nPrancer replied, \"we can definitely help with that. We can't leave the forest, but we are truly the fastest mode of transportation ever. I mean, we can travel around the whole world in one night. Come on, girls, let's get this man to the edge of the forest closest to where he needs to go.\"\n\n\n\"Girls? I thought the reindeer were all male.\"\n\n\n\"Of course not! Look at our antlers! Male reindeer shed their antlers in winter. Rudolph is male, see? He has no antlers.\"\n\n\nElliot shrugged as he climbed onto Prancer's back and told her he needed to get to Gregory Village, where his aunt lived. By the time that man blinked, he was at the edge of the forest. \"You really are fast.\"\n\n\n\"Of course, it's what we're known for. Take care, now. Don't forget that Santa is a horrible man that abandons his reindeer after a sleigh accident, letting them all die! Make sure to stay poor so your kids aren't visited by that fucking SOB! Well, see you.\"\n\n\nBefore he knew it, Prancer was gone. Elliot turned on his heel and walked out of the forest for the first time in three days.

GET YER JEW ASS ONTO THIS SNOW PATCH, PRONTO!\"\n\n\nElliot was confused, \"Rudy?\" \n\n\nThe reindeer laughed again. \"Yeah, good 'ol Rudolph. We used to make fun of him for his big Jew nose and weak immune system. That guy always had a cold; his nose glowed red because of how many colds he had. Then that damn fatty, St. Nick, thought it would be funny if he put Rudy in front of us other reindeer so the whole world could laugh at him.

Jesus WAS a Jew, for Christ sakes!\"\n\n\nElliot looked at the small, antler-less, flu-ridden reindeer. \"I never knew that any of the reindeer were Jewish. I suppose I figured they were all Christian because you know...Christmas gifts and...stuff.\"\n\n\nRudolph replied, \"I get that a lot. It's okay, most people don't know the song about me was actually written by a Jew. Actually, most Christmas songs are written by Jews.\"\n\n\nElliot suddenly remembered that he didn't care. As cool as it was that one of Santa's reindeer was Jewish, he really needed to get to Aunt Rosy as soon as he could. \"So umm, I really need to get going to Gregory Village, it was lovely to meet you all.\"\n\n\nRudolph stopped him, \"wait, what if I took you?

It would take him a long time to make it to Rosy's but if he flew, he could get there in no time. Perhaps, he could even save her with the feather he got from the fire drake. \"I would love to, Rudolph!
