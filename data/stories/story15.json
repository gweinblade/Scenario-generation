The story won't make any sense at all if you don't read the first one.

Please rate and comment about the positive and negative things you find after reading the story, so I could create a better part 3!\n\nPart 2 is a little bit inclined towards choosing your own decisions. In the first part you would choose a decision and it wouldn't make much difference, and I tried to change that here in part 2. Though the story is still linear, with only one ending, the choices you make would affect the story more.

From someone else's sight, my body would've looked like a meteor hurtling towards the ocean.\n\nAbout six months ago, I was just a confused mortal. I didn't even know the purpose in my existance much less how to save mortal lives that are important to me. \n\nNow, I'm not a mere mortal anymore. I'm a God.\n\nI'm Gaius, the unknown God. My own father, Zeus, granted me powers in unheard of portions so that I was able to kill his enemies for him. Now, I know nothing else and follow nothing else except one purpose for my life: to avenge my mother, my home, and kill my father Zeus, Lord of the Skies and King of the Gods. He has given me everything that I wanted and has taken from me everything that I had. With all the power in the world and nothing else left for you, what would you have done?\n\nI spent a full month recovering from my battle with Typhon before setting off on my current journey. During those times, I wondered how to kill a God, possibly the most powerful God out of them all. I found the answer, hence my current descent towards the earth at inhuman speeds.\n\nI hardly felt the opposite force when my falling body hit the salty waters in the ocean. Though a normal human would've died in the collision, my speed didn't even slow down after the impact.\n\nAs I went deeper, the colors of the water turned to a darker shade of blue until I can hardly see anything. Then, after minutes of blind descent, I swam through black waters, through nothing.\n\nThough blind by the darkness of the deep, I felt the ground below me and slowed down my speed. Where I'm at is not underwater at all; it's like an entirely new place. I stood on a dark surface of a rock floor.\n\nIn front of me loomed a dark hole on the ground. The hole was an even darker shade of black which permitted my eyes to see it even when one wouldn't expect anything to be darker than its immediate surroundings.\n\nIn front of me was the bottomless pit of Tartarus.", "action_results": [{"action": "What are you waiting for? Dive right in!", "result": "Tartarus was dark. Even with my newfound powers, I actually felt a little hesitant \"swimming\" through it. Now, to be more precise, Tartarus is not like land on earth nor water in the ocean. In this place, darkness is an actual thing you can touch, like swimming through something solid.\n\nI feel the power that is so old and so ancient, I shuddered to think who or what could be the source of it.\n\nHere it comes, I'm losing it. Everyone, even the Gods, are afraid to even set foot in Tartarus because it's basically the Prison of the Gods. This is the place where the most powerful and the most evil villains in Greek history are kept. I knew one wrong move and it wouldn't even matter if I'm a God. . . I will die.\n\nI concentrated. I thought of my mother, dying in my arms. I thought of King Percix, whose body probably disintegrated along with the others in my village. I thought of the moment I told Zeus that I accept whatever sacrifice he asks. I collected all my anger and all my fear, and used it to create a wall of thirst and determination in my mind. With it, I was able to push through.\n\nWith eyes closed, I swam through, knowing that opening them wouldn't even matter. I concentrated on one name inside my head, the one name that I was seeking for in the first place. That's when I felt a pulling force leading me towards a place with dim light.\n\nI followed the force, obediently, and I hated every second of it. Here I am, with almost unlimited powers, and yet I'm still not the one in control.\n\nMy eyes had to adjust to the weak light that swallowed up the darkness. When my vision cleared, I was standing at a prison cell. There are no source of light anywhere. The pale light comes from the bronze walls that enclosed the cell. Looking up, I found out that the ceiling is too high to be seen. There's nothing else in the room except for the chained figure in front of me.\n\nWith chains as thick as a whale's body, a giant, hunched-over humanoid figure stood in front of me. I've met Gods before, and this one was only slightly different. His presence sends out an old aura; an aura that was probably as ancient as the creation of the world.\n\nI tried to unsheathe my sword, which slung sheathed along my back, but I was forced to stop. A force was preventing me from moving. It was like time was being controlled to do someone's bidding. After some struggles, I came to find out that the force is not as solid as one would think. Imagine a group of men trying to hold your body down instead of invisible chains totally binding you from moving. You can fight the force, the changing with the time.\n\nI wasn't as nearly surprised because it would make sense.

In one fluid motion, my sword was pointed at Kronos.\n\n\"You will answer my question, Kronos, or suffer the same fate as your brother, Typhon,\" I said staring at Kronos intently and studying him, in case I had no choice but to beat the answer out of him. He looked pathetic compared to Typhon. I would guess it's because Kronos was supposedly dismembered before being locked away here in Tartarus.\n\nI came to Tartarus to seek the help of Kronos on how to defeat the Gods. Who else would know more than Zeus's own father about killing his own son; the son who overthrew his own father to become the King of the World, sliced him to pieces, and locked him up here. I figured I have a good chance with completing this task easily because Zeus and Kronos's relationship is as good as me and my own father's.\n\n\"How can I defeat your son, Zeus?\" I asked.\n\nThe figure didn't move a muscle.", "action_results": [{"action": "Slash him with my sword", "result": "I didn't expect the situation to turn out like this but I had no choice. As fast as a lightning bolt, I climbed up Krono's body, slashing at every bit of flesh that wasn't already covered in wounds. I hacked and slashed, down his legs, then up his shoulder, waiting for a response from him.\n\nWithin minutes, Ichor, the golden blood of immortals, glistened and gushed out of all the wounds that scattered across Kronos's body. Though there was still no movement that escaped from the titan, I sensed a faint sound that is coming out of his lips.\n\nA low whimper. The powerful titan is quietly crying in pain.\n\nI almost felt bad but suddenly the low whimper turned to a loud, vicious growl. \"Curse you, son of Zeus! You have successfully killed my brother and now you're here adding to my endless torment,\" Kronos said, with voice that probably sounded really horrifying before but is now reduced to nothing short of a weakened moan.\n\nAll the pity that I felt for the titan turned to disgust and embarassment. \"I can't believe Zeus has broken you!\" I scolded, \"In the old stories, you would device ingenious plans to try and get revenge from your son. Now, I'm here asking for your aid so that I can defeat that very same son and you do nothing but cry and whine.\" I ended my speech with a quick stab at his leg.\n\nKronos howled in pain.\n\nI felt the same forces that I felt earlier trying to disable my movements again, but I broke through them like they're nothing. I concentrated then shot a powerful lightning bolt from my fingers which hit the titan square in the chest. This was the last that he would take from me.\n\n\"Stop this madness! I'll tell you what you need to know,\" Kronos pleaded, \"Just stop hurting me!\"\n\nI obeyed and stopped, waiting for the answer I've been longing for.\n\n\"Consider yourself lucky that these chains bind me and weaken my powers. If it weren't for them, you would be dead right now,\" Kronos sighed.\n\nFor a moment, I felt curious and somewhat tempted to release him from his shackles. Surely, he couldn't be more powerful than Typhon and I handled Typhon easily. Then, I imagined the time control ability he had and blew it up ten times stronger. I saw myself standing like a statue while Kronos prepared to strike; his ability could give him a little edge when he's unleashed.\n\nI striked him again, with a sinister smile on my face. \"Do not speak unless you speak of the answer I want. Refuse to tell me the answer and I would cut off your tounge so you will never speak again,\" I said.\n\nGritting his teeth, he said, \"There's a very rare creature called the Ophiotaurus. They say that killing it and burning its entrails would give its killer the power to kill the Gods. I have no further knowledge about it but the moment I break free, hunting the Ophiotaurus would be the first thing I'd do.\"\n\nI looked back towards the dark door I came from and started walking. I didn't listen to Kronos while he said, \"Alone. . . you will. . . not. . .\" the rest of his words were drowned out when darkness swallowed my form again. Then I made my way back to the surface.", "action_results": [{"action": "Hunt for the Ophiotaurus", "result": "The wind felt good on my skin as I took in my first breath of fresh air in a little while. I hovered about ten feet above the sea, and now wonders where to go now that I'm stuck in this crossroad.\n\nI have never heard of the Ophiotaurus in my life. My mother would tell me all the stories about the Greek Gods, and the heroes, and the monsters, but she never mentioned anything about a monster possessing the powers enough to defeat the Gods. And according to Kronos, I have to find a way to kill this all-powerful Ophiotaurus and sacrifice it to gain the power.\n\nIn my head, I couldn't even picture anything that could have that power. To capture this beast, I will need some help.\n\nIf this beast has the power to kill Gods, me alone, me a God, might not have a chance. I need to find the strongest warrior in the land to help me tame the elusive beast.\n\nAnother problem popped in my head. Kronos didn't know where I could start looking for the monster. I remembered Chiron teaching me all I need to know about hunting even the monsters that no man would look for. But, one would think, the best of all the hunters would have looked for the Ophiotaurus already and no one found it. In this problem, I would need another person.\n\nI would have to find the greatest hunter in these lands and convince him or her to help me. I realized that I wouldn't be able to get my revenge without the help of others.\n\nWho should I look for first?", "action_results": [{"action": "Without the hunter, I would never even find the Ophiotaurus. Find the greatest hunter in these lands!", "result": "A couple months have passed since my journey to Tartarus, and now I went down on all fours once again trying to see the tracks of the monster that I'm hunting. There were scattered feathers, too, which means this could be the one that I need.\n\nI asked for information from a nearby town about my hunter right after I went out from Tartarus. They told of a hunter so powerful, sometimes one might mistake her for the Goddess of the Hunt herself, Artemis. She hunts in these parts of the forest but not many has seen her at all. I figured hunting the most powerful monsters in the forest might lead me to her, eventually. And, that I did.\n\nThe forest ceiling didn't allow much sunlight to stream through it so the forest looked dark. Everywhere I turned there were shrubbery and plantlife. The place was quiet except for the soft breeze and the occasional insect calling out to each other. I inhaled the fresh wildlife air and was immediately filled with memories of training under Chiron, the centaur.\n\nMany times, he would thrust me inside an unfamiliar forest with nothing except the cloth in my back and tells me to survive off nature. He would leave me there for a full month at most and when he comes back, we continued to train, never stopping. The forest floor felt vaguely familiar in my feet, partly because I've probably stepped on forest floors longer than the floors of my own home.\n\nConcentrating back to what I was doing, I saw tracks that led northwards and followed them. Following the tracks, I saw some footprints but not human footprints. The footprints are not different from a bird's.\n\nSuddenly, I heard some faint rustling to my left. This noise could've been anything but the fact that whatever made it tried to hide it, held my attention. I can tell because Chiron had taught me how to hide my own noises inside a forest. Maybe another form of monster is hunting this same monster I'm hunting. . . Or if my luck improves, maybe it's the hunter that I'm looking for.\n\nI pretended not to hear the rustling so as not to startle whatever it is that's out there and continued following the tracks under me. The tracks led me to a small river where the ugliest creature I've ever seen drank.\n\nIt was a bird which had a human head, a lady's head. The harpy stood at just about the same height as me. From where I was hiding, I guessed it had a wingspan of just the same length as its height. It drank carefully from the river. I sensed its natural alertness as it made no noise and seemed to listen to every other noise in the forest.\n\nBewildered by what I was seeing, I didn't notice another figure sneaking her way beside me. I almost jumped but she held me down and put a hand over my mouth.\n\n\"Don't make any noise,\" she whispered, \"This might be my only chance of catching this thing.\"\n\nShe had bright green eyes that jumped out off her dark tanned skin. Her eyes never left the harpy as if she's trying to subdue it by sheer willpower. Her brown hair was parted from her face almost concealing a long bow and a quiver full of arrows that hung across her back. She wore dirty green clothing like she's been inside a forest her whole life.\n\nCarefully and silently, she started to grab her bow. She succeeded in making no noise then she started notching an arrow and aiming right at the harpy.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, a twig broke underneath my feet. With the silence of the forest, it sounded like thunder.\n\nStartled, the harpy looked right at our direction and prepared to take flight.\n\nThe brown-haired girl let loose her arrow but the harpy was already in the air. The arrow stuck to the bird's leg and the harpy let out a painful squawk. Looking more closely, I saw a thin string attached to the arrow. She hooked onto the harpy.\n\n\"Curse you,\" she yelled at me. The string tugged and then dragged her off her feet in the air. They continued to rise towards the sunlit skies.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fly after her!", "result": "I took a deep breath and shot myself up towards the fleeing harpy and its \"hunter.\" The brown-haired girl is now almost at the top of her string, within an arm's distance away from the harpy's body.

I got on its back and held on for dear life. It tried to bite my skin but my godly powers prevented her from making any wounds.\n\nWith me holding down its wings, our flight eased up. Seizing the opportunity, the hunter girl stabbed at the harpy multiple times. Dark red fountains gushed out from where she stabbed.\n\nWhen I felt no more movements coming from the harpy, I let go. Then, I realized my mistake.\n\nThe fight became so insane that I didn't notice we were about 50 feet in the air. When I let go of the dead monster, the hunter girl screamed as she fell with the corpse.\n\nWith a groan, I shot towards her flailing body and managed to catch her.

She stood up and dusted herself off. \"You're welcome? If it hadn't been for you, I could've killed the beast without being 50 feet in the air!\" she exclaimed with a clearly angered voice.\n\nI was going to argue but then she looked for the corpse and then made towards it. Trying to hide my anger, I followed her.\n\n\"Why were you hunting the harpy anyway?\" she asked me without looking up from skinning the corpse.\n\n\"Who said I was trying to kill it?\" I answered with a question, which was very unlike me, \"Maybe, I was just trying to get close to it.\"\n\nI knelt right by her and watched what she was doing. She skinned the harpy expertly and within seconds had the pelt ready for tinning. I asked her why she was hunting the same monster and scolded myself for the stupidity of the question. She told me she was hungry and needed something to sell for food, gesturing for the harpy pelt.\n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked.\n\n\"My mother called me Saria,\" she said, hesitantly.\n\nI felt a great burden being lifted off my shoulders. It was her. Saria, the legendary huntress who hunts the monster no man would dare hunt.\n\n\"Well, Saria, seeing your prowess in battle, first hand, would you care to help me in my quest?\" I asked her, unknowingly extending my hand towards her.\n\n\"What quest?\" she asked.\n\nI told her about my quest to hunt the Ophiotaurus.

It didn't sold much partly because Saria was a terrible haggler. Everytime one of our potential customers tried to haggle low, she would take out her knife and place it by the customer's throat. She was lucky I was there to stop her from killing almost everyone. Then I wondered, how did she survived living off hunting without me?\n\nThought it didn't sold much, she was able to buy a good amount of food. Hesitantly, she allowed me to have some while we made our way out of the village.\n\n\"First of all, I want to thank you,\" I said, munching on an apple, \"For joining me on my quest.\"\n\n\"It's been a long time since I've been with people,\" she answered, not looking at me, \"Mostly, because they're boring. But, because you have a quest in mind, I hope going along with you won't be as boring. Your quest won't be boring will it?\"\n\nA low chuckle escaped my mouth. If she only knew. . .\n\n\"Before we could go on, we need another sword to help out. And, when I say sword, I don't mean just any warrior. I mean the greatest warrior there is.

There's a village named Tedgora, just two days walk from here, where a young warrior was said to be unbeatable in combat.\"\n\n\"An unbeatable warrior?\" I asked, \"Maybe I should give sparring with him a try.\" The thought of the most powerful fighter in the lands intrigued me, mostly because I want to find out how I would compare to him.\n\n\"They said that he bathe in the River Styx and bear the Curse of Achilles,\" she continued, \"And, he's a demigod. Maybe you know his father, the God of War, Ares.\"\n\nShe looked at me and then a flash of surprise crossed her face. Then, I realized I was grinning like a mad man. I can't help myself.

I flew about 20 feet upwards and, after making sure Saria was also safely above the ground, I hurled myself towards the village and the monster. It felt good to fly, feeling the winds buffeting my face.\n\nLooking back, I saw Saria already aiming an arrow straight at the giant dog. She fired and hit one of the monster's face in the nose.\n\nI gave her the signal, and threw her towards the tall walls of the village. Being a hunter, she expertly landed on her feet. She notched three arrows at once then fired at the giant dog again, this time hitting it by the other nose.\n\nEnraged, the dog started running towards Saria, whose too busy trying to notch arrows on her bow.\n\nFocusing on the winds, I blasted across the sky and hit the dog right between its heads. The mid-air tackle sent it flying about ten feet backwards.\n\nIt didn't took long to recover though and was back on its feet in no time. Slowly then gaining more speed, it started to run towards us again.\n\nAn arrow sprouted from one of its four eyes, effectively blinding it and slowing it for a moment.\n\nThen, suddenly, the dog stopped and roared in pain. It turned around and I saw why. Its tail was replaced by a cleanly-cut, bloody stub that sprouted behind it. I guessed, it was looking for the one responsible and turned its attention away from us.\n\nI was about to hurl a lightning bolt at it when a voice yelled, \"WHO ARE YOU?\"\n\nI looked around and saw a well-muscled young man clad in leather armor below me. He was about the same age as me though he looked a lot taller and darker. In his hands was the biggest two-handed sword I have ever seen.\n\nAs I reach the ground, he ran towards me and said, \"I would really appreciate it if you would help me vanquish this monstrosity away from my town.\"\n\nWith a nod, we faced the monster whose now standing right in front of us.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Two-Headed Dog", "result": "I started concentrating at the winds while the warrior charged at it.

The dog was completely disabled of any kind of movement or chances to counterattack.\n\nThe warrior wielded his giant sword like I wield a small stick.

Probably the most powerful fishermen and hunters have already worked together to catch the Ophiotaurus. This just proves how difficulty the task could become. But, a small combination of powers between a God, the most powerful demigod, and the most powerful hunter might have a better chance of succeeding.

Now in plain sight, I was able to see the scales of the serpent body glistening in the moonlight. The whole length of the monster traversed the whole beach. The waves rocked the dead body back and forth like it was still trying to get back in the ocean.\n\n\"Maybe you should have something to eat first,\" Anasimos advised, pushing towards me an uneaten cooked rabbit.\n\n\"Make the fire bigger!\" I ordered, my voice sounded stern with a slight exhaustion that was carefully hidden.\n\nI made my way towards the corpse and pulled out my sword. With it, I sliced open the Ophiotaurus's corpse and took out the insides. Blood covered my hand and the air stunk of decaying flesh.\n\nThe campfire was turned into a sacrificial fire which burned a bigger flame. With a silent gasp, I threw the innards into the scorching fire.\n\nI waited for something to happen. Nothing did.\n\n...\n\n...\n\nA full half hour passed and still nothing happened.\n\nEnraged, I felt my anger being passed on to the skies and the clouds started turning dark gray. In minutes, a series of tornadoes were dancing around the beach. The sea water was swept up by the tornadoes and created salty rain that hurts when it hits your eyes. Amazingly, the sacrificial flame didn't extinguish under the heavy rain.\n\n\"STOP IT!\" Saria yelled over the screaming winds, \"STOP IT, GAIUS, PLEASE!\"\n\nHer voice seemed to calm me down a bit. The tornadoes subsided and the rain stopped but the clouds remained gray.\n\n\"Don't you realize what happened?\" I asked Saria, with anger in my voice, anger that didn't apply to her. \"Kronos has lied to me! I don't feel any different, do you? I should have the power to kill all the Gods but I do not feel anything! Kronos-\"\n\n\"Kronos? The Titan of Time?\" Anasimos interrupted, \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nWith heavy hesitation, I told them my story. I told them about my journey to kill Typhon in the name of my father. I told them about me becoming a God. I had tears in my eyes, as I told them walking and seeing Mene and my Mother killed.I told them about my oath to avenge my mother from Zeus. I told them about my journey to Tartarus and my conversation with Kronos. I told them how I've been using them all along.\n\nThey were silent the whole time. After I told my tale, Saria and Anasimos wouldn't meet my eyes. I couldn't blame them, if I were in their position, I'd kill the lying traitor right on the spot.\n\nAnasimos broke the silence, \"So, you do not intend to train me at all? Master?\" He had a smile on his face. \"My Master has been wronged by the Lord of the Gods. I think it's time we make our way to Olympus.\" He held out his hand towards me.\n\nSpeechless, I took it and even gave him a hug. A smile filled with gratitude and thank spread across my face. Then, it disappeared as fast as it came as I saw Saria, still looking down towards the campfire.\n\nI approached her and was surprised to find no words coming out from my mouth.\n\n\"I-I'm--\" I stuttered. I scolded myself silently, what happened to the natural speaker trait that I inherited from Zeus? What's happening to me?\n\nSaria saved me from myself. Her brown hair looked blood red with the brightness of the flames. The green eyes that always seemed to paralyze me looked full of grief. She sniffed back a tear and said, \"Did you really kill Typhon without me?\" The brightest smile I've ever seen showed in her face.\n\nWe shook hands and I couldn't help but notice the silly grin that wouldn't leave my mouth. Stop it!\n\n\"The Gods have done me wrong, I know it, and both of you know it,\" I said, \"But the Gods are eternally more powerful than the Ophiotaurus. They have wronged me, not you. I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if you get killed because of me. This quest is suicide.\"\n\nSaria cracked her neck. \"Well, then you'll probably need us Lord Gaius. A God needs help sometimes, too.\"\n\nWith that, our conversation was over. I thought, maybe the hunt for the Ophiotaurus wasn't as much of a disappointment after all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time for revenge.

Her brown hair danced with the winds but she looked fine like she's entering heaven. Anasimos, on the other hand, had a face of a scared dog. He's looking only at the rocky ground as if making sure that it's not going to disappear right under him.\n\nWe were almost at the peak but the Palace of the Gods were still nowhere to be seen.\n\nDiscouraged and frustrated, I yelled, \"ZEUS! WHERE ARE YOU? FACE ME AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR CRIMES!\" The words echoed off the distance.\n\n\"He shall not have to deal with your arrogance, Gaius!\" a lady's voice said.\n\nA girl clothed in a golden dress and a golden battle helmet walked out from a clutter of rocks. Her black hair was straightly combed and in her left shoulder stood a white owl resting. A long double-edged sword rested in her right arm and a huge round shield slung across her back. Her eyes resonated with knowledge, knowledge about everything about me, knowledge about everything that I wouldn't want her to know about.\n\nThe three of us stopped. I drew my sword and stood between her and my friends.\n\n\"This does not concern you, Athena!\" I said, with a voice full of contempt. \"Do not make me kill you!\"\n\nThis was it.

The mere Goddess of Knowledge shall not stop me.\n\n\"My dear son, do you think waging war and threatening to kill my good King Zeus would allow me to let you live?\" Athena said, lifting her sword making the white owl fly away from her arms. \"You don't realize what you are doing, as usual. Gaius, if, by some sort of miracle, you do kill my Lord Zeus, do you know what would happen to your world? No, it would suffer, it would die. A world without a King is bound to fall. By killing Zeus, you will be killing the world!\"\n\nHer words didn't even mean anything to me. For every syllable she uttered, the flames of my fury strengthened. Drawing powers from the clouds, I charged her.\n\n\"FOOL! YOU WILL DARE CHALLENGE ME? THE GODDESS OF WAR?\" Athena yelled in rage.

And, as tradition, every half-human, half-gods are supposed to be powerful in combat.\n\nI stood at the center of the town, drawing some attention to myself. I concentrated knowing that if this warrior was powerful enough, I would be able to sense him. The winds smelled of produce that's almost ripe, which brings back bad memories.\n\nAlmost a minute passed, and then I felt him.\n\nThe powerful aura was coming from the direction of the blacksmith. Looking there, I saw a young man, probably the same age as me, working on a sword. In one look, I could tell he was a warrior. What gave it away? Maybe, it was the two-handed sword strapped to his back with a length almost the same height as him. Or maybe it was the familiar aura that I feel whenever something powerful stands by me. You choose.\n\nI approached the man and said, \"I've never seen a sword like that before. Did you make it?\"\n\n\"You've never seen someone make a sword before? Yes, I made it, it only took me about half an hour to get it to its current state,\" he said, holding up the sword he was working on, which glowed a shade of orange and yellow.\n\nI had to suppress a smile for the misunderstanding because his voice sounded like he would kill me if I smiled. His words had a careful yet arrogant tone to it, much like mine's if I'm talking to strangers. I felt a connection with this boy already.\n\n\"I meant that giant bronze weapon strapped to your back,\" I said, pointing at his sword.\n\nA flash of irritation spread through his face, \"Do you think I'm an idiot? Of course, I knew you were talking about this sword. My father, Ares, gave it to me when I completed my training with him.\"\n\n\"You trained with the God of War himself?\" I asked, hoping to get the reaction I wanted, \"Did you defeat him?\"\n\nThe reaction was right on the mark. His face turned redder than the fires behind him and I could swear I saw smoke billowing from his nostrils. \"I'm busy! Get away already before I use this sword to make you go away,\" he said, threateningly.\n\n\"Maybe that's exactly what I want you to do,\" I said, pulling out my sword and pointing it straight at him, \"If what you say is true then I would expect you're strong. My name is Gaius, an adventurer, and I need your help for my quest.\" I said the words loud enough so that people around the town would hear.\n\nRealizing I cornered him, the blacksmith had no choice but to stop his work and hope his reputation won't get anymore damaged.", "action_results": [{"action": "Step into the center of the town", "result": "\"That's a dirty trick you played there, son of Zeus,\" he said, brandishing the giant sword that he held with surprising ease.\n\n\"I'm guessing you felt my presence long before I felt yours,\" I said, quite amazed, \"How about we introduce ourselves before we kill each other?\"\n\nWithout waiting for anything, he said, \"My name is Anasimos, son of Ares and bearer of the Curse of Achilles!\" pointing his giant sword at me, \"My Apodosi and I will tear you to shreds and teach you a lesson your father never knew.\"\n\nI smiled. A giant sword named yield is not something to be serious about. Furthermore, he bathe in the River Styx which makes him almost indestructible. I would enjoy this fight.\n\nThen, I stopped the crazy man's attitude and became serious again. \"My name is Gaius, son of the Lord Zeus and slayer of the mighty Typhon!\" I shouted. The skies started turning dark and terrifying. I hoped to see even a small look of worry in Anasimos's face, but was surprised to see nothing. This man has seen things a lot more sinister than me.

In a blink of an eye, Anasimos delivered a painful elbow on my gut and has his giant sword pointed at my face.\n\nHe's fast for an average mortal but he has to know that I'm not just an average mortal. I flipped my body backwards and kicked his sword away from my face. Using the momentum of the flip, I hurled straight at him with my sword pointing right at his chest.\n\nI could tell he was a little surprised at my sudden burst of speed but it didn't stop him from reacting correctly. Proving he's one of the rare warrior who never flinch, Anasimos sidestepped my attack with great ease.\n\nNow that I had my back turned, Anasimos seized the opportunity and tried to slash me. I could just feel all the anger and the hate being welled up in the strike.\n\nQuick as a lightning, I blocked his attack. He staggered with my inhuman strength. Finally, a flash of surprise and fear showed in his face. I was smiling again, I noticed. This fight is turning to be one of the hardest I've fought on for a long time.\n\nMustering all my strength, I placed a powerful kick right on his chest. He didn't have time to react and was sent flying about ten feet in the other direction.\n\nI was surprised to see what happened next. It wasn't the fact that Anasimos stood back up like nothing.

And with that, the glow engulfed his whole body. Now, it looked like flames are eating away on his limbs, like he was burning alive. But, I knew the truth. He has developed enough anger and hate towards me that his most powerful ally, fury, has made itself physically seen. A fury that's so strong you could see it with your naked eyes.\n\nI was facing a different opponent. An opponent that has its sights on killing not just winning.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, the blood-red figure was in front of me. I had no time to react as he hit me with the blunt of his sword, sending me soaring upwards to the sky.\n\nThe clouds seemed to revitalize me as I step in my domain, the sky. I willed the winds to help me float, an ability that now seemed like second nature to me.\n\nAfter being healed of fatigue and damage from the fight, I controlled the winds to take me lower. I hovered above the ground in a height slightly above Anasimos's reach.\n\n\"What they say is true,\" I called to Anasimos, \"You are the most powerful warrior in the lands. Now, this fight has clearly gotten out of hand. We shall stop and prevent putting these innocent people in harm's way.\" Pictures of fleeing villagers scattered about as I see the whole village from up here. \"Let's not do anything rash now!\" I said.\n\nWith my luck, I thought, Anasimos would be so consumed with anger that he won't even understand what I'm saying, much more, obey them. And, that's exactly what happened.\n\nThe glowing figure that was once Anasimos roared so loud I bet Kronos heard it down in Tartarus. He then leaped out off the ground and left a crater where he once stood. The leap closed the distance between me and him in mere seconds.\n\nHe gave me no choice, I thought.

She knelt and attended to his wounds. I saw a trickle of tear drops streaming down her face. I felt bad.\n\n\"Help me bring him inside the house,\" she said to me, \"He's still alive, do not worry.\"\n\nI was about to argue that he went crazy on me but decided to keep my mouth closed.

She cooked food like how my own mother used to.\n\nI was enjoying my stay at this paradise when of course the inevitable end of it all comes.\n\nWhen Anasimos woke, he didn't saw me the way his mother did. He grabbed his sword and pointed it straight at me. Meanwhile, I stood there with my hands up, weaponless.\n\nI was already checking the million fighting tactics that Chiron drilled into my head, when Anasimos did the unexpected. He lowered his Apodosi, looked down, and knelt before me.\n\n\"Please, you must teach me how to fight like that,\" he said, with a voice still hoarse with fatigue, \"You say I'm the greatest warrior in the lands, yet you beat me like I was nothing. My father and I had dueled 57 times and I lost to him in all of them. Teach me, Master Gaius! Teach me, so the next time I faced my father, he shall be the one begging for mercy.\"\n\nI was taken back by the sudden change of heart. Then, I realized this is just what I needed. If I promise to train Anasimos, I will surely be able to get him to follow me.\n\n\"Fine, I will pass on to you what I know,\" I said, confidently knowing that this relationship would benefit me a lot more than him.\n\n\"Thank you, Master!\" he exclaimed.

The forest was a sight to behold.\n\nNaturally, I steeled my senses. A forest with this beauty could only mean one thing: a trap. I expected a monster that can put on a disguise or something that is entire invisible.\n\nBut, what we look for might be a little bit more dangerous than a monster.\n\nIt's been a few months since Anasimos and I left Tedgora. I thought I would have to ask around nearby villages for the whereabouts of my hunter but all I had to do was ask the young warrior.\n\n\"There are rumors about an incredible hunter who hunts monsters, no man would even dare hunt,\" he said, \"They said that this hunter's so good, no one is better except only Lady Artemis herself.\"\n\nWith that in mind, obviously, we hunt for the monsters that no man would hunt, and hope that we run into the elusive hunter.

The thought only made me doubt my surroundings more so I banished it from my head.\n\nRemembering all the hunting training that I went through with Chiron, I surveyed the ground for tracks. I had to walk about ten more steps until I found them. Faint tracks leading to the north. They weren't from humans beings, I was sure.\n\nSuddenly, a loud, feminine shout echoed through the forest. \"HELP!\" the voice yelled, \"THE LION'S OVER HERE!\"\n\nI looked up and barely saw the source of the shouts, a figure with long brown hair running northwards. She was wearing a hunter's garment, a long bow slung across her back along with a full quiver of arrows.

If the stories from the nearby villages were right, this monster is strong. Even the mighty Hercules had a difficult time killing one of them. This made the monster so terrifying that no sane man would try to hunt it.\n\nAnasimos and I had an agreement to face this monster at the same time so as not to put ourselves in more danger than we are already in.

The rocky ceiling was just an average height, about ten feet above my head. The rock formation opened up in one part of the cave roof which let in a stream of bright light in the middle of the dark cave.\n\nAs if by tradition, the light illuminated the girl in the hunter's garment who shouted for help. She was kneeling on the largest rock in the cave and she seemed to be sobbing. Her brown hair along with her body shook in time with the gasps of air.\n\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?\" I asked Anasimos in whispers, \"The cave seems clear yet you wait here doing nothing while a damsel in distress is over there crying to herself.\" I scolded him like this lesson should be obvious to him but I thought what would Chiron say?\n\nHe would say it's a trap, but then again, Chiron saw everything as a trap. Once, Chiron and I went to a nearby village to get some food. A little kid, suddenly, offered him a slice of bread that the kid was eating. I had never seen Chiron so scared in my life. He froze and I had to take the bread and then give it to my master. He finally unfroze and said It could've been a trap.

The roar that came out from her wasn't human in any way.\n\nConfused, I searched where the loud warning came from. I looked back towards the entrance of the cave and saw an amazing sight.\n\nAnother girl was standing there casting a huge shadow over my face. She looked almost identical to the monster behind me but she was clearly a mortal, probably the same age as me. Her long brown hair was parted away from her face and her green eyes focused on the monster behind me.

Who else would be stupid enough to be caught into such an obvious trap?\"\n\nI didn't have time to become annoyed by the insult because the lion appeared to mimic a cat's actions when its about to pounce.

I figured he was a retired soldier and seeing the way he stood, I doubt he was really going to attack me.\n\nI held up my hand before he gets any ideas. \"Do you know where I can search for the real warrior that I'm looking for?\" I asked the man, with utmost seriousness in my voice.\n\nThe man dropped his stance and sagged his shoulders. I knew the promise of wealth to anyone is really promising but a great warrior wouldn't do anything just to gain money. The man shifted from toe to toe then said, \"In the village, Tedgora, east of here, there's a man. . . \"\n\nI didn't hear the rest because I was already out the door, heading east.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Throw a lightning bolt at him", "result": "I concentrated and looked for the heavenly powers that are inside me. I pointed two fingers at Kronos and from them shot off a lightning bolt straight at his chest. To my surprise, the bolt didn't even seem to faze him though the air parted at the ferocity of the released power.\n\nThis lack of reaction annoyed me so I fired off nine more lightning bolts at Kronos. After the ninth bolt, I felt for my energy and was surprised to find out that it's not there. My breath started to come out in gasps. Looking at Kronos, I was a little glad to see that at least I did cause some damage.\n\nGolden ichor, the blood of the immortals, gushed out of the wounds that I caused.\n\n\"Speak, Titan!\" I yelled.\n\nA dark laughter echoed through the bronze cage. \"My body is used to getting hit by lightning bolts,\" he said, \"And with weak lightning bolts like that, there's no way you will defeat my son!\"\n\nObviously, I was annoyed. This titan has bronze shackles around his arms and he dares insult me? I turned my anger into concentration. Then as fast as a lightning bolt, I climbed up Krono's body, slashing at every bit of flesh that wasn't already covered in wounds. I hacked and slashed, down his legs, then up his shoulder, waiting for a different response from him.\n\nKronos howled in pain. I had to suppress a dark smile from showing on my lips.\n\nI felt the same forces that I felt earlier trying to disable my movements again, but I broke through them like they're nothing. I concentrated then shot a powerful lightning bolt from my fingers which hit the titan square in the chest. This was the last that he would take from me.\n\n\"Stop this madness! I'll tell you what you need to know,\" Kronos pleaded, \"Just stop hurting me!\"\n\nI obeyed and stopped, waiting for the answer I've been longing for.\n\n\"Consider yourself lucky that these chains bind me and weaken my powers. If it weren't for them, you would be dead right now,\" Kronos sighed.\n\nFor a moment, I felt curious and somewhat tempted to release him from his shackles. Surely, he couldn't be more powerful than Typhon and I handled Typhon easily. Then, I imagined the time control ability he had and blew it up ten times stronger. I saw myself standing like a statue while Kronos prepared to strike; his ability could give him a little edge when he's unleashed.\n\nI striked him again, with a sinister smile on my face. \"Do not speak unless you speak of the answer I want. Refuse to tell me the answer and I would cut off your tounge so you will never speak again,\" I said.\n\nGritting his teeth, he said, \"There's a very rare creature called the Ophiotaurus. They say that killing it and burning its entrails would give its killer the power to kill the Gods. I have no further knowledge about it but the moment I break free, hunting the Ophiotaurus would be the first thing I'd do.\"\n\nI looked back towards the dark door I came from and started walking.

The same force earlier stopped me in mid-stride. His face looked powerful and dangerous yet it also looked old and frail. He stands with his eyes closed almost like he's meditating or sleeping while standing.\n\nI convinced myself that there is no reason to take out my weapon or act aggressively because I knew for a fact that we're on the same side.\n\n\"Kronos, the all-mighty Lord of Time, I've come to ask you a question you would surely know the answer to,\" I said, trying hard not to add malice or sarcasm in my words, \"What is the best way to defeat your son, Zeus?\"\n\nAt the sound of the compliment, Kronos opened his eyes and looked at me. There was nothing in them, only blackness, like the darkness has swallowed his eyes, too. \"You thought that you would just walk in here and ask for that secret?\" Kronos said with a voice that might've been powerful before, but right now sounds weak and defeated, \"You thought I would give you the answer that easily?\"\n\nAnswer:", "action_results": [{"action": "Yes, you hate Zeus as much as I do", "result": "\"Maybe you didn't know before, but your son has wronged the both of us,\" I said, \"You thirst for revenge as much as I do.\" It would make sense. In the old legends, Zeus overthrew Kronos for the throne in the heavens and sliced him up. The sky god then shackled the dismembered Kronos here at Tartarus. If I was him, I would use all my time in here plotting for revenge.\n\n\"Surely with all the time you spent down here, you already deviced a plan for revenge!\" I said, unsure where the sudden certainty that filled my voice came from.\n\nKronos smiled, but there was no joy nor happiness in them, only pain.\n\n\"You want to kill my son?\" he asked, \"Well the best weapon to do it is right here chained up. Free me and together we will defeat Zeus and take back my Kingdom!\"\n\nI pondered the severity of this choice. Freeing Kronos would be a great help if I was to kill Zeus. But, I thought, what would he do if I do give him the throne in Olympus? I have no desire to sit on the throne myself because surely I am powerful but I am not a leader. I remembered the legends of the Golden Age of Greece; when Titans ruled the lands. When humans never have to suffer death. No one has to suffer losing people they love.\n\n\"Are you brave or strong enough to even break my chains?\" Kronos asked, ending my thinking, \"We shall see Olympus destroyed with you and me in the middle of the flames!\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Break the chains and unleash Kronos!", "result": "\"You better not make me regret this,\" I said. I mustered all the powers within me and broke the chains that imprisoned the titan.\n\nThe bronze chains hit the ground with a loud boom. Kronos didn't move at first. Then, his face changed. He looked dark and sinister, I thought again why I freed him in the first place. The promise of a better world and no one dying, but how can I forget that with Olympus destroyed, all the world as I know it would be destroyed and changed also.\n\nI steeled myself preparing to correct the huge mistake that I just made. The sword in my hand felt heavy and I feel my chest pumping in fear that was not showing at all in my face. I decided to charge the titan. I took a step and suddenly time started slowing down and finally stopping everything. I tried to break through the force like before but it's much more stronger now.\n\nI stood there paralyzed while Kronos straightened his stance. From down here, I could tell that Typhon was taller and much scarier, physically. The difference is that Kronos now wields his signature scythe; the very scythe that was used by Zeus to kill him. It stands at twent feet tall almost as tall as Kronos who stands at probably twice that height. There was an aura of ancient bloodthirst and determination that surrounded Kronos.\n\n\"One touch from the blade of this scythe and your soul will be severed from your body,\" Kronos bragged, lifting up his weapon.\n\nI tried to break free from the force with all my might but it wouldn't budge. In fear, I was forced to step back. To my surprise, I found it easier to step back from the Titan. I had a ridiculous theory.\n\nUsing all my willpower, I was able to back up fast enough to dodge Kronos's strike. With the scythe only inches away from my body, I felt my soul being tugged towards it, which didn't help me at all.\n\nKronos's power over time weakens the farther away from him I get. I imagined a sort of magical field surrounding Kronos's body that would paralyze anyone who would cross it. Outside his magical field, I was able to move around and think of a way to stop him.", "action_results": [{"action": "Look around the room", "result": "I tried my best not to get close to Kronos. There must be something I could do to stop this monster. My eyes scanned the empty room and was attracted by a dim shine coming from something. That could work!\n\n\nI made my way to the thing, careful not to get in Kronos's magic field. It's bronze color made it almost invisible on the bronze floor but because I knew it was there I wasn't fooled.\n\n\nI knew that this idea would be my death if it fails but at the top of my lungs I shouted, \"Kronos! I can see that you've gotten slower over the years! Would you like to take a reprieve?\"\n\n\nKronos's reaction surprised me, but I was ready for it. He smiled the same evil smile and apparently bent the time around him to make him almost appear out of thin air in front of me.\n\n\n\"I can be as fast or as slow as I want,\" he said, lifting his scythe once again getting ready to strike me down, \"Why would I rush through killing you when I can enjoy it as long as I can?\"\n\n\nI started to feel time being bent around me again, slowing my movements. But, this time I was a little faster than time. As Kronos lowered his weapon for the kill, I picked up the chains that used to bind him from the ground and tied his arm with it.\n\n\nThe enchanted bronze drained his power once again and made Kronos drop his scythe. I felt the magical field starting to weaken again and I used my speed to fasten the other chain around his other arm.\n\n\n\"NO!\" was the only word Kronos could shout as I tied the chains back to the ground and imprison the mighty Lord of Time once again. My breath came in gasps. I didn't notice how much energy it took me to work around Kronos's ability to bend time until the fight was done.

I noticed that after the battle, Kronos's scythe dropped to the ground right by him. Thankfully, the hilt doesn't have the same curse that its blade has, of reaping the soul of anyone who touches it, so it was alright for me to wield the scythe. Maybe I could use this to my advantage.\n\n\nI slashed at the weakened Kronos. The slash took a huge chunk off of his thigh and when I say \"took it\", I was not exaggerating. The blade \"ate\" at Kronos's flesh completely devouring the missing part of Kronos's legs.\n\n\nKronos howled in pain then seemed to chuckle from his current situation. \"Another God using my own weapon against me,\" he whispered almost to himself.\n\n\nI gave him another hit, this time only with the blunt of the scythe. I knew I won't get any answers from Kronos if he passed out from being \"eaten\" by his own weapon. The hit closed his mouth for him.\n\n\n\"You will not speak,\" I told the titan, \"Unless you speak of another way to defeat Zeus.\" I knew it would've been pleasurable to torture him but I refuse to become like my father.\n\n\nThe titan kept quiet.\n\n\nI feinted another strike and that broke him. \"Enough! Stop this madness! I'll tell you what you need to know!\" he shouted, \"There's a rare beast which, if stories are right, would give anyone the power to kill the Gods.\"\n\n\nA beast with enough power to defeat all the Gods? I shuddered at the thought of something having that kind of power.\n\n\n\"What is it called?\" I asked, \"How do I find it?\"\n\n\n\"They called it the Ophiotaurus. They said if you sacrifice its entrails, it would grant you unlimited power,\" Kronos answered obediently, \"But, like I told you, the Ophiotaurus is rare, I do not know where you can find it.\"\n\n\nFinally, we're done. I dropped the scythe and walked towards the door.

You have successfully killed my brother and now you're here adding to my endless torment,\" Kronos said, with voice that probably sounded really horrifying before but is now reduced to nothing short of a weakened moan.\n\nAll the pity that I felt for the titan turned to disgust and embarassment. \"I can't believe Zeus has broken you!\" I scolded, \"In the old stories, you would device ingenious plans to try and get revenge from your son.
