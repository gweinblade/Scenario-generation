But I was happy.\n\n\nMy wife's name was Jeonna. Jeonna and I were very happy together, we lived on a small house. Jeonna sold the boquets she made with wildflowers that grew around the mountain and I did whatever odd jobs came up around town. We lived off of these funds and we knew we could never get rich off of what we did but... We were happy. That was enough.\n\n\nJeonna had two children late one Spring, twins. A healthy son, a son I was proud of to call my son. And a daughter, a daughter that I loved with all my might. While our son was unusually strong for a child, our daughter grew weaker by the day. The doctor said she wouldn't last long.\n\n\nJeonna and I didn't believe him.\n\n\nJeonna came up with the names for our son and daughter through an ancient language that her mother had taught her. Ari was the name of our daughter, it meant 'life', and Hitari was the name of our son, it mean 'protector of life'. Jeonna was happy staying behind and only gathering the flowers that were near our house. She wove a basket for Ari and Hitari to ride in so that they could go with her. She believed that nothing would harm our family.\n\n\nI was cautious of what the doctor had said. \n\n\nEven though I didn't believe him. I knew that he had seen children like Ari die before. So I was worried, I was careful, but I didn't believe him.\n\n\nAri fell ill when she was two, right when Jeonna and I were beginning to be convinced the doctor was wrong, our fears came crashing back onto us. Ari grew weaker day by day until she became too weak to feed. Jeonna would cry herself to sleep at night, when she slept that was. Most nights she was too scared to fall asleep to the possibility that she might wake up, and Ari would be dead.\n\n\nHitari caught the cold as well.\n\n\nI wasn't surprised, really, the two of them shared everything. They had the same emerald eyes and golden blond hair. They both opened their eyes at the same time, fell asleep at the same time, and fed at the same time. One couldn't sleep without the other and if they were separated for too long they would start wailing for the other. Personality wise they were almost polar opposites, Hitari was calm and intelligent from the start. Already having small, child-like conversations before he was even a year old. He learned to walk almost as quickly as well, he was physically very strong. Ari got the hang of talking when she was about 16 months old, but she started walking at the very same time. Ari was weak, but she made up for it in the capacity of what she could learn. And she never forgot anything, ever.\n\n\nJeonna was worried even more so, even though I told her it was only natural. Then, it happened one day.\n\n\nAri and Hitari disappeared.\n\n\nJeonna and I didn't know where they could have gone. We searched everywhere, woke up the entire village and sent out a search party to look for them. The village elder found them by the lake outside of the village. Hitari's hand was interlocked with Ari's. Ari was being gently brushed by the water's edge of the lake. Hitari was gripping her as hard as his little hand could manage, he was out of the water's reach. Neither of them had the fever anymore.\n\n\nThe lake was said to be the portal to the Spirit's World that spirits went through when they died.\n\n\nThe village elder proclaimed that Hitari must have pulled Ari away from the spirits, thereby saving her and giving her more time in the world. Jeonna and I were overjoyed, no matter how ridiculous the reason they ended up there. Neither of us really believed the elder, it's only now that I look back on that day and wonder if he may have been onto something then. Life went peacefully and Hitari and Ari grew up wonderfully.\n\n\nThey were six when the next tragic event happened.", "action_results": [{"action": "Jeonna was killed by the King's men.", "result": "I could not believe what had happened.\n\n\nOur 'glorious' King killed Jeonna, my lovely Jeonna.\n\n\nA neighboring kingdom came to raid our village, the King's men charged in to help our village. Jeonna and I were overjoyed, we would be safe. Jeonna and I took Ari and Hitari up to the attic to protect them from the battle that raged outside. We all huddled in the damp, dark attic, scared but hopeful. Frightened but faithful that our 'brave' King would take down the bandits.\n\n\n\"Momma? What are those noises?\" Ari asked Jeonna with wide, scared eyes. Jeonna wasn't sure how to explain it, neither was I. My daughter was too innocent to be exposed to the evils of the world. Hitari slung his arm around Ari.\n\n\n\"Don't worry Ari, it's just nasty monsters trying to raid the village. And they're coming to get you~!\" He teased, Ari pushed him away and protested lightly, but a new light came into her eyes.\n\n\n\"Like the one's in my closet! Hitari! Do you think you can scare these monsters away too?\" She asked happily. Monster's in my daughter's closet? She always did have a wild imagination, but why didn't she come to her parents for protection as most little girls did? I suppose Hitari must have played that role for her at this time. Perhaps it was wrong about me but I was jealous of my son. Jealous that he got to share in the childhood memories of Ari when I should have been there as well. Hitari laughed and smiled,\n\n\n\"I can't but some others are scaring them away right now! That's the monster's cries of fear!\" He explained, referring to the yells and screams outside. Ari laughed quietly.\n\n\n\"Monster's afraid... What a silly thought!\" She said as she laughed. Jeonna and I smiled at each other. Then Jeonna gently quieted down Ari's laughter and we were surrounded in dark silence once again. Only broken when the lone cry of a fallen solider pierced the silence.\n\n\nThe battle was over quickly, the King won. Jeonna and I went out to the square with the rest of the village, we had Ari and Hitari stay behind so that they would not see the carnage.\n\n\nJeonna never liked blood, even when she pricked her hand on a thorn she could never look straight at the blood without a look of disgust wrinkling her beautiful face. So as we walked through the dead bodies of King's men and bandits alike, she buried her head in my shoulder and held my hand like a child would when frightened. I hugged her close to me, the ominous scent of death wafting up around us and making me crinkle my nose in disgust.\n\n\nThe people gathered around the King's men who were giving a rallying speech to shake the fear of battle off of our soldiers. If only Jeonna and I had walked up a minute later, if only we had decided to stay with the children... If only...\n\n\n\"... We have discovered a traitor among your village! The wretch shall be publicly executed for their crimes in causing a loss of so many good men!\" The lead soldier shouted, the people murmured uncomfortably. I was surprised, I knew everyone in our small village well, I was sure there was no traitor among us. The soldier looked around before his eyes settled on Jeonna and myself. I hugged her closer to me. He sneered.\n\n\n\"And that wretch is that woman!\" He shouted as he pointed to Jeonna. Jeonna sucked in a gasp and I screamed a protest in outrage. I was helpless and a gang of soldiers knocked me back and ripped Jeonna from my grasp. She was shouting my name the entire time they led her up to the lead soldier. I screamed her name back and tried to wrestle my way through the soldiers. The people were too stunned to move.\n\n\n\"Die for your sins.\" The head soldier chanted as he unsheathed his sword and kicked her to the ground. I shouted to Jeonna, all senses were trained solely on my wife. She was paralyzed with fear as the soldier raised his sword. My voice began to catch in my throat. I yelled as if yelling her name would drag her back to me and away from danger. Then there was a tug on my sleeve.\n\n\n\"Papa?\"\n\n\nAri. Ari and Hitari stood there. Ari looking up at me with scared eyes, she didn't understand what was going on. Hitari was staring ahead, at the soldier with the sword raised above his head. I was frozen, my eyes only turning back to my wife in time to see the metal come down. And slice clean through my beloved's neck. The soldiers parted for me. I fell to the ground on my knees, my palms in the red pool of blood of other men that had fallen. My tears joined the liquid pool. Ari tugged on my shirt once more.\n\n\n\"Papa? What... What just happened to Mama?\" She asked, tears were welling up in her eyes. On some level Ari understood, I don't know how she did but she did. I was unable to answer my daughter.\n\n\nWhen I looked up at my wife's body I saw that Hitari had moved to stand next to her, he was completely still. Just staring at the body, as if he was made of stone.\n\n\nI felt a hand on my back. Joviah Smith, the local farmer had his hand on my back.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry they picked Jeonna, she was a good woman.\" He said sadly. I focused in on one word,\n\n\n\"Picked?\" I asked him, Joviah's eyes widened.\n\n\n\"You hadn't heard, every time the neighboring kingdom has invaded, the King orders his men to pick a random villager and call them a traitor and publicly kill them, take the blame off of his own head by using other's heads.\" Joviah explained. When I didn't reply he sighed and gently took Ari's arms,\n\n\n\"Come, Ari, I'll take you and yer brother back to yer house.\" He said as he gently led her over to Hitari to take them back. I just stayed there for a moment. Rage burned through my heart, eating it at it's core. I wanted revenge, I wanted to make the King pay for what he had done. I knew then and there that I would get my revenge.\n\n\nI kept up on my promise.", "action_results": [{"action": "I took action right away.", "result": "I attempted to break into the King's nearest house at night, he had houses scattered all over the country but I knew the Queen was staying at this one. An eye for an eye, a wife for a wife.\n\n\nI was careless, the guards caught me and made quick work. They saved me until the next raid and presented me as a traitor from another land who gathered information.\n\n\nSo this is what Jeonna had felt like?\n\n\nSorry Ari, Hitari, looks like I won't be making it to dinner.", "action_results": [{"action": "\"End\" Game and Leave Comments", "result": "Those were what I thought would have been my last thoughts. But, as if fate was repeating itself in an endless loop. I heard a voice.\n\n\n\"Papa?\" My eyes opened and settled in on Ari and Hitari standing there. How had they found me? I may never know. Ari ran forward, the guards had attempted to stop her but she was small enough to duck under their arms and get a way to me. Hitari followed close behind her.\n\n\n\"Stop! You can't kill him! You can't!\" She was screaming, tears were running down her face. The guard with the sword raised his sword in warning, fully intending to kill me. I had tried to smile at Ari, telling her it was alright. And I had closed my eyes. Waiting for the blade that never came.\n\n\nHitari had stopped the sword.\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes Hitari was standing above the soldier previously holding the sword. Now the sword was embedded in the soldier. Hitari's hands were on the blade, he stood as still as he had when Jeonna had died. The ropes that had bound my hands and feet came loose and then fell below me. Ari had untied them behind me.\n\n\n\"Papa, we have to leave, now.\" Ari said. Hitari came and joined us, the sword still in his hands. The soldier was dead. Hitari had a dark look about him. He was saying something to quiet for me to hear at the time, but now I realize he was saying 'I killed someone' over and over again. As if he did it without thinking, which perhaps he could have.\n\n\nAri, Hitari and I were running away from the soldiers and villagers and everything, I thought we were free. I had stupidly thought we were safe. But there was a sound, soft yet it now rings in my ears every time I remember it. It was the soft 'twang' of an arrow.\n\n\nAri's body slumped to the ground. Hitari stopped and ran back to her. Shouting her name just as I had when Jeonna died. \n\n\nFate repeats itself.\n\n\nThe rest was a blur to me, I remember dragging Hitari away from Ari, I remember tears and running, fear and loneliness. Sadness and loss.\n\n\nThen I remember when we were finally away from the soldiers, I turned to Hitari and uttered his name to talk to him, but he just looked at me and had said.\n\n\n\"I am Ari from now on. I no longer 'protect' life. I am simply alive.\" He proclaimed. Hitari became Ari after that. I still am skeptical whether he changed his name because he couldn't protect Ari's life, or because it was a way to honor Ari, to remind us she had been alive. No matter how painful that reminder may be.\n\n\n \n\nEnd of Part One", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "I started out small.", "result": "I knew I had to train.\n\n\nTaking revenge against the King would be no small feat. I needed to practiced. I started out by doing small thieving jobs. When I found I could get away from the villagers I began to steal bigger things. I eventually stole Joviah Smith's cow. I was careless, they followed it's tracks back to my house and kicked me out of the village upon finding the other stolen items.\n\n\nAri, Hitari and I were left as travelers. We stayed out along the roads, we would stop in towns for a day or two. I would practice, then we would leave. They were blissfully ignorant of their father's lifestyle.\n\n\nMy progress was sure, but slow.\n\n\nI began to be able to get away with stealing larger items. I eventually tried something rather big again. I stole a horse and left the town with Ari and Hitari. They were twelve by now. Six years had passed since Jeonna's death.\n\n\nSix years since I decided my fate.\n\n\nHitari was never really the same. He was less cheerful and stopped making the clever jokes he did as a child. He was cold now, to everyone but Ari and myself. Even then he was distant with us. Never talked that much anymore, just sort of listless. This only encouraged my desire for revenge.\n\n\nAri surprised me. She became braver, taking care of us by taking up her Mother's idea of selling flowers. She would make jewelry and bouquets with what we found on the road and used the money she earned to then buy bread and water for us. Her favorite thing to make were flower crowns by interweaving the stems of the flowers, but usually only children bought those. She still made them, for Hitari and myself.\n\n\n\"You look adorable Hitari!\" She smiled as she placed a flower crown on Hitari's head, startling him from his nap against a large oak tree. Hitari reached up and felt the flower crown.\n\n\n\"Don't take it off!\" Ari pouted. Hitari complied and let his hand drop. He stood up, both he and Ari had long plaits going down their back and ending at their knees. I couldn't afford a hair dresser anymore.\n\n\n\"Why did you make me this?\" Hitari asked quietly, one hand on the flower crown. Ari beamed again, she herself had a flower crown on, as well as a bracelet, necklace, and earrings she had made. She had always loved dressing herself up in the jewelry she made.\n\n\n\"Because you looked sad so I thought it might cheer you up!\" She said as she smiled. Hitari seemed a little shocked, then he, too, smiled.\n\n\n\"Thank you... It... Makes me happy.\" He said as he let his hand drop. Ari promptly grabbed his hand and slipped the bracelet from her hand over to his.\n\n\n\"Really?! Then you'll love this! I'll have to make more then! Oh!\" She turned abruptly and ran down to me. Ari stood up on her tip-toes and placed a flower crown on my own head.\n\n\n\"And this is for you Papa!\" She said with a smile. I had thanked her and gently touched the blooms that adorned my head.\n\n\nAri was always thinking of us.\n\n\nHitari was too, but in a different way.\n\n\n\"I know you stole that horse.\" Hitari accused me one day while Ari was out of ear shot. I was shocked at the harsh tone coming from my beloved son. I admitted I had, I could not have hid it from him forever.\n\n\n\"This isn't the first time is it?\" Hitari asked me, his eyes narrowed into suspicious slits. I sighed and shook my head. Hitari had glared at me then. His silence was as cold as his words had been. He said only one last thing to me.\n\n\n\"Don't put Ari in danger. I won't forgive you.\" He had told me before turning and walking off. I turned back to the horse, I had stroked it's neck and simply told the horse that he hadn't understood. That I was doing it for Ari, and Hitari, and also Jeonna.\n\n\nI had forgotten to say I was doing it for myself as well.\n\n\nI had eventually gotten information from one of the locals at a town we were staying at. The information was about the King and Queen.\n\n\nI finally had a plan.", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Ari was hurt.", "result": "I'll never forgive myself.\n\n\nIt's all my fault.\n\n\nHitari wanted to come with me on one of my trips to do an odd job. This one was in the mountains. Ari came as well, not wanting to be left behind. Stupidly I let my six year old children come with me to a dangerous place.\n\n\nIt's all my fault.\n\n\n\"Hey! Hitari! Look at these mushrooms!\" Ari called as she looked at the giant spores growing out of the ground. Hitari lightly tapped her on the head.\n\n\n\"Oi, don't touch them, they might be poisonous.\" He said, Ari pouted and made a small, disappointed sound. I was becoming slightly annoyed, if they kept side tracking like this we wouldn't be home in time for dinner.\n\n\n\"Listen to Hitari and stay on the path!\" I called to Ari, she sighed and walked back to the path. Hitari following casually.\n\n\nIt's all my fault.\n\n\n\"Ari! I told you not to touch them!\" I turned when Hitari scolded Ari. Ari was holding one of the mushrooms.\n\n\n\"You can't boss me around Hitari!\" Ari said, Hitari and Ari started arguing. It had seemed like they had been doing that a lot recently. I was sick of it.\n\n\n\"Ari! Hitari told you not to touch the mushroom and you did! You know nothing about the wilderness like I've taught Hitari! Don't be an idiot!\" I yelled at Ari. Ari was taken aback, then she glared at me.\n\n\n\"You love Hitari more than me!\" She accused. I was sick of her tantrums, her fits and moods.\n\n\n\"So what if I do?\" I questioned her. Ari's eyes widened, even Hitari seemed stunned by my coldness. Ari went running away and Hitari followed.\n\n\n\"Ari! Ari, wait!\" Hitari yelled and ran after her, I quickly realized what I had said and ran after her and Hitari.\n\n\nAri was reckless when she ran, she ran straight along the edge of the waterfall.\n\n\n\"Ari! Ari, please stop!\" Hitari called out to his sister desperately. Ari turned around for just a moment and her foot slipped on the wet rock beneath her. She began to scream even before she fell. Hitari tried to lunge out to grab her but he ended up just jumping off of the cliff as well. I watched helplessly as Hitari hugged Ari, the two of them falling down the side of the waterfall and cliff. I had a false hope that the water might break their fall. That my son and daughter would be alright. But as I ran over to the edge and peered down. I saw that even though my hope could have happened if they hit the water, it proved false.\n\n\nThe lay by the lake, as they had when they were babies, Hitari clutching desperately to Ari, the water was lapping at Ari's dress. They were both drenched with their own blood, they're blood mixed together in the lake. They were both stone still, cold, dead.\n\n\nIt's all my fault.\n\n\nIt's all my fault.\n\n\nIt's all my fault.\n\n\nMy fault\n\n\nMy fault.\n\n\nMy fault.\n\n\n \n\nI was to blame, it's was all my fault that they died.\n\n\nSo I decided to join them.", "action_results": []}]}
