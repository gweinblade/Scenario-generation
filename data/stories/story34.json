{"tree_id": "https://chooseyourstory.com/story/viewer/default.aspx?StoryId=61587", "context": "", "first_story_block": "\"The traveler is at the campfire! Go, go!\" The news spread like wildfire. Soon, all the children of the village were gathered at the firepit. \"Will you tell us a story?\" they begged. The traveler wasn't very used to kids, so it took her a while before she realized they wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\n\n\"Alright,\" she relented. \"Imagine... that you're a dragon, flying over the forest on a summer's day. The sun is on your wings, the wind is in  your ears, and the world is your playground...\"\n\n\nYou're soaring over your domain, the largest forest in the region. The humans call it the Essucia Woods. It's a bright summer's day, but you're not worried about being spotted. You're soaring right over the thick of the wood, where centaurs, elves, lizardfolk, and hundreds of other dangerous creatures live\u2014it's obvious no human would ever dare to enter. \n\n\nOr, at least, you thought no human would ever dare to go there. You're quite surprised to see a young woman, little more than a girl, standing alone in a clearing. Doesn't she know that's essentially screaming, \"Monsters! Come and kill me!\"  You fly over to get a closer look, and the girl notices you. Instead of running away (which is quite useless, because you could easily catch up to her) she calls out. \"Dragon!\" This girl is either really brave, really stupid, or a combination of both.\n\n\nYou prefer to keep a low profile on account of the humans. If you were to attempt to plunder their treasures, their armies might seek you out. Though you could probably take them on with ease, humans can get annoyingly lucky. One of them might actually do some damage. So if you were to talk to this girl, she might share what you actually look like to her family and friends, as opposed to the legends that scare people away.\n\n\nBy the way her rucksack is swinging, you can tell it has something heavy in it, quite possibly gold. She's dressed in a fancy cloak and it's evident she hasn't been in the forest for long.  It might be worth seeing what this girl is calling out to you for. On the other hand, this might be a trap. It seems a little too obvious. Still, most traps wouldn't hurt a scale of yours, and you'd prefer to see what this girl is up to when she doesn't have the jump on you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk to the girl", "result": "You land beside the girl. You're fairly sure she doesn't pose much of a threat, and if you wanted to, you could eat her in a heartbeat. \"Why did you call out to me?\" you ask, curious. \"You realize there are a thousand different ways I could kill you.\"\n\n\n\"Yet you haven't used any of them.\" she responds. So she's smarter than she looks. \"I came to make you an offer. I'm a princess, which means I'm going to be married off as some sort of political tool. I don't want to get married just because some old dude offered my father an alliance. I don't want to get married at all, so I'm running away.\"\n\n\n\"Then what on earth did you catch my attention for?\" you ask impatiently.\n\n\n\"I'm getting to that,\" she answers. \"If I run away on my own, my father will send out search teams. There'll be a lot of people combing the woods, and it's only a matter of time before they find me. However, if I was \"captured\" by a powerful being, like a dragon...\"\n\n\n\"People would be scared and only individuals would try to rescue you.\" you finish. \"What's in it for me?\" In response to this, she dumps the contents of her sack out onto the ground. A diamond necklace, a jeweled chalice, and a large pile of gold coins spill out.\n\n\n\"I'd also ask you to lurk around the area I'm in to keep up appearances. So, what do you say?\"\n\n\nIf she is right about only individuals coming, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. However, the reason you've stayed in the woods is because humans can be annoyingly powerful if they put their minds to it. And who knows? Maybe one of them will get lucky. Still, it's a half-decent payoff for a minor service... You consider all these factors, and you finally reach a decision.\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Yes.", "result": "Someone paying you to kidnap them? That's a pretty good deal. \"Don't forget to fly near the town so that they see me being 'captured', \" the girl says.\n\n\n\"How do I know this isn't a trap to kill me? Not that you could,\" you ask.\n\n\n\"You'll be carrying me in between your claws.\" she says with complete confidence. \"If the archers shoot you, you'll bring me down with you. And if anything goes wrong, like you said, you have a thousand different ways to kill me. \"\n\n\nAfter she picks the treasure back up (you'll know if anything is missing) she walks through the forest towards the castle. You follow, the trees concealing your green-brown scales. Once she enters the fields surrounding the castle, she starts skipping and whistling a tune, really playing the part of the helpless maiden.\n\n\nThen comes your favorite part. You swoop down, aiming for the girl. A peasant boy comes by, spots you, and starts to freak out. \"Princess Selena, look out!\" the boy yells.\n\n\n\"Look out for what?\" she says, pretending to not notice you behind her.\n\n\n\"It's a\u2014\" the peasant boy starts, but is interrupted by you catching her in your talons and taking to the air.\n\n\n\"Dragon!\" the girl screams. \"Oh, woe is me! A dragon is capturing me! Won't somebody help save me from this fearsome beast? Oh, no!\" She's really getting into the role. You fly around the castle a few times for good measure, and pretty soon the whole town is in an uproar.\n\n\n\"A dragon is capturing the princess! What are we going to do?\" Why, the townsfolk are more melodramatic than the princess, and she knows what's going on. You fly off into the distance, chuckling to yourself. Once the girl stops her damsel-in-distress act, she asks you what's so funny.\n\n\n\"Well, your entire town went into an uproar because one girl got captured. Humans really do obsess over the silliest things.\" you respond. You figure you'll just leave her in some spot in the forest and hope she survives, but you see the wizard's tower in the distance and you get an idea. You're sure there's some good magical loot in there, but that arrogant wizard put wards up to keep dragons from entering. The wizard's long gone, but the wards still remain. The girl, however, should be able to enter, and in time you may be able to convince her to lower the wards, if she learns magic.\n\n\nYou don't say any of this to her, though. Instead, you just fly over and say, \"Here. This will be a more habitable place than most. And if someone tries to rescue you, they'll have to waste their time climbing the tower. But this is a wizard's tower, so don't touch anything until you've described it to me. I don't want you blowing yourself up.\" You also don't want her to use all the magic in the tower before you've had a chance to exploit it.\n\n\nA few days pass. The girl hasn't appeared to find much of interest. All she's found so far is a journal of sorts, a heavy tome with weird symbols in it. You've seen the wizard carrying it around, but it didn't really do anything. What harm can it cause? She also hasn't found the Pool of Seeing yet. It's fairly easy to use. All you need to do is speak the name of a person you've met in person or the name of a place you've been, and it will show the user that which they named. Since it's outside of the tower, you have used it many times. What would happen if the girl used it? The pool could potentially boost her magical power. On a more practical note, she could be aware of any knights trying to \"rescue\" her. Still, knowledge is power, and you prefer when you have power as opposed to someone else.", "action_results": [{"action": "Show her the pool", "result": "\"Girl, have you seen the pool in the back?\"\n\n\n\"Are you talking about the koi pond?\" she asks. \"Yeah, I've seen it. Why?\"\n\n\n\"It will allow you to see any person or place you've seen before.\"\n\n\n\"Cool! How does it work?\" she says, and then leaps off the balcony. Instead of falling, she floats down and lands gently on the ground. \"I've been practicing that spell.\" she admits.\n\n\n\"Not bad,\" you say, hiding your feelings. She's taken the initiative to practice magic, which means she'll be able to take down the wards, but on the other hand, she could become a threat.\n\n\n\"Hello?\" the girl says, snapping her fingers in front of your face. \"How does it work again?\"\n\n\n\"All you do is speak the name of the thing you wish to see.\" you say, still a bit surprised that she's already grown so comfortable in your presence. Even though you've known her for a while now, you're still unsure of whether she's brave or stupid. Maybe she's getting a little too comfortable with you.\n\n\n\"Show me my father,\" she orders. You roll your eyes.\n\n\n\"The pool doesn't know who you are or who your father is. You must state his name.\" \n\n\n\"Ohh! That's how it works. I knew that.\" she says, unsuccessfully trying to hide the fact that she's been poking the water with a stick. You're starting to lean towards the stupid of the brave or stupid dilemma. \"Show me King Henricus Archibald the Third.\" she tries again.\n\n\n\"Let me guess,\" you say. \"Your full name is Selena Magnificent Beauticious\u2014\"\n\n\n\"It's just Selena,\" the girl says, annoyed. \"Look!\" The pool shows a bearded man donning a red cloak and a golden crown, the human symbols of royalty. He looks like he hasn't slept in days.\n\n\n\"Why haven't we sent out a search party yet?\" demands the king, but from his expression you can tell he already knows the answer.\n\n\n\"You know everyone in their right mind is absolutely terrified of the dragon,\" the queen says, coming to the king's side. \"We can't expect the militia to fight a dragon!\" At least the girl's parents have some common sense, though you can't say the same for their daughter.\n\n\n\"How do you know she's even alive?\" says the king miserably.\n\n\n\"The dragon didn't kill her immediately, instead taking her back to its lair. It probably wants to lure more victims in and is using her as bait.\" the queen answers.\n\n\nSuddenly, the king seems to hold himself taller. \"We'll gather knights from across the kingdoms! Tell them that there's a great beast imprisoning a helpless maiden,\"\u2014 the girl scoffs at this\u2014\"and that it must be vanquished!\"\n\n\n\"What sort of reward should we give?\" asks the queen, starting to regain hope. \"Facing a dragon is no easy feat.\"\n\n\nThe king considers this. \"Since someone stole a lot of treasure out of the royal treasury, we can't exactly give a cash reward, or the thief might steal it again.\" You look at the girl.\n\n\n\"So what?\" she says. \"I'm sure you've stolen your fair share of treasure as well.\" You decide not to answer and turn your attention back to the pool.\n\n\n\"Perhaps we can solve two problems at once,\" the king says. \"We still don't have an heir to the throne. Such a worthy soul, to slay a dragon, would surely make a fine heir.\"\n\n\n\"So you're suggesting...\" the queen begins.\n\n\n\"The knight that rescues Selena would have her hand in marriage.\"\n\n\nThe queen pauses. \"You know Selena would not be okay with this.\"\n\n\nThe king laughs. \"Nonsense! She'd be so grateful to her rescuer that I'd be surprised if she didn't marry him on the spot!\"\n\n\n\"I'm fairly sure that isn't how it's going to go...\" the queen tries to say, but the king isn't listening anymore.\n\n\n\"Send the messengers throughout the land!\" the king proclaims. \"We are in search of knights!\" The vision fades, and the water is a clear pool once more.\n\n\n\"That is not going to happen,\" says the girl. \"I am not getting married to some idiot with a big sword and a bigger ego.\"\n\n\n\"Well spoken,\" you state. \"But what are you going to do about it, girl?\"\n\n\n\"First off, my name is Selena, not girl. And second, I've been practicing more than just floating out of a tower.\" She shows an elegant wand tipped with a blue crystal that glows faintly. \"Mutati vigil ut endormi rever, tempo soisminno,\" she pronounces, pointing her wand at a nearby boar. The crystal's glow intensifies, and the boar promptly falls asleep.\n\n\n\"You can cure insomnia. Fantastic.\" you say dryly.\n\n\n\"But think about it!\" the girl\u2014Selena\u2014protests. \"If the knight falls asleep on the job, that's even worse than facing a dragon! He'll be ridiculed!\"\n\n\n\"Fair,\" you say. \"Oh, and thanks for the snack.\" You stab the boar through the heart, killing it instantly. Selena makes a sort of squawking noise. You turn to her, annoyed. \"Please. It's not like you don't eat meat.\"\n\n\n\"But\u2014you just\u2014\"\n\n\n\"Killed it? Yes, I'm aware. Humans take some sadistic sort of pleasure in hunting. I've seen them send their dogs after the prey, have them rip off its limbs.This way\u2014\" you motion to the dead boar, \"it just felt like falling asleep.\"\n\n\nSelena has finally managed to wipe that shell-shocked expression off her face. \"Just... don't do that to the knights, okay?\"\n\n\nYou sigh. \"Don't worry. Humans are much too bony\u2014I'm kidding, I'm kidding,\" you say, even though you weren't really kidding. Looks like she's never lived through one of humankind's wars or seen any death... until now. Oops.\n\n\nShe enters the tower, then pokes her head back out. \"I forgot to ask,\" she says. \"What's your name? I'll need it to see you in the pool.\" Curses. If you don't give your name, it'll appear suspicious. But names can be a powerful thing, used in spells and things like the Pool of Seeing.\n\n\n\"My name is Eryllis,\" you finally state. \n\n\nA few days later, the first knight arrives.", "action_results": [{"action": "The knights.", "result": "You spot him from the air. Although the girl\u2014Selena\u2014told you not to kill him, that doesn't mean you can't have some fun.\n\n\nHe's riding on a white horse and he's wearing armor that looks like it's never been used. He's carrying an enormous sword, the idiot. It'll slow him down and be virtually useless for blocking attacks. He also isn't wearing a helmet\u2014the better to smile at Selena with.\n\n\n\"Fair princess,\" he begins. \"I am Sir Hildebrant and I have come to save thee from\u2014\" FWOOMP. You snatch the guy right off his horse, who gallops away in terror. Smart horse. The knight tries to reach for his sword, but you've got him pinned so tightly, he can't move. You fling him far away, into the Eckbel bog.\n\n\n\"I told you not to kill him!\" Selena exclaims hysterically.\n\n\n\"Relax. I know my own strength.\" you state.\n\n\n\"Show me Hildebrant!\" Selena demands. The pool swirls, and shows a knight flying through the sky. He lands in the bog, sinking deep in the mud. For a moment, you think he might not resurface, but then you see a mop of mud-caked hair emerge, and you know he'll be fine.\n\n\n\"Right over my new armor, too! I didn't think it would be a real dragon!\" he whines.\n\n\nYou chuckle. \"What did he think I would be, a stuffed dragon?\" Selena giggles in response.\n\n\nYou both had a good laugh as the upstart tried to explain himself to the king and queen. \"I fought valiantly, but in the end I had to flee from the dragon. I barely escaped with my life.\"  he explained.\n\n\n\"Shut up,\" you say, \"You were fine.\"\n\n\n\"Why are you covered in mud?\" the queen asks.\n\n\n\"Well\u2014I\u2014you see\u2014\" he stammers.\n\n\n\"You are not fit for my daughter,\" the king declares.\n\n\nThe next few knights are of a similar standard. You dispatch them all easily. On one sunny morning, however, comes a knight of a different caliber...\n\n\nYou don't even see him coming. Instead of coming through the path, he snuck through the woods. \"Dragon,\" you hear him call. You whirl around, only to see a small figure, much skinnier than the others. His armor is too big and you almost feel sorry for him. He doesn't look like much more of a threat than the girl.  \"I wish not to harm you,\" he continues, evidently disguising his voice to make it sound deeper than it actually is. \"Will you hear me out?", "action_results": [{"action": "Listen to the knight", "result": "\"Speak,\" you declare.\n\n\n\"First, I'd like to thank you for showing mercy to the princess.\"\n\n\n\"You mean not killing her? That's hardly altruistic.\" you answer.\n\n\n\"Whatever the case, thank you. She means a lot to her parents and to the entire kingdom.\"\n\n\n\"I can tell. So far, you've sent\u2014what, five knights now? What makes you think you'll fare any differently?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I seek to liberate the princess, not to kill the dragon,\" the knight states. \"Will you release her? I offer myself in exchange.\" You scrutinize him. He seems serious. \n\n\nSelena walks out onto the balcony. \"See, there's where you're getting it wrong. Maybe she would release me, except I haven't been captured.\" Though the knight is wearing a visor, you can practically see the shock in his eyes.\n\n\n\"You came here willingly? But the whole kingdom saw you get captured!\" Selena looks at you, as if deciding whether to admit the truth.\n\n\n\"It was a setup,\" you say. Selena proceeds to tell the knight your story.\n\n\nThe knight looks at Selena with a look of disbelief. \"You caused your parents so much distress, and for what? To hide away in a tower? To be the plaything of a dragon? They've barely slept, and when they did, they had nightmares of you getting tortured and starved!\"\n\n\n\"No one understands!\" Selena yells back. \"To you, I'm just a pretty girl in a dress who doesn't know what's good for herself. Who can't lead a kingdom, who needs to be protected from her 'feminine curiosity'. Does that sound about right?\"\n\n\nThe knight, however, isn't done. \"Well, at least you have a family who cares! My family sent their only child off with nothing but the clothes on her back and a loaf of bread!\" You're surprised Selena hasn't realized it yet. Deciding enough is enough, you dive at the knight, who tries to leap out of the way, but is too slow. You weren't aiming for the knight, though. \n\n\nThe knight gets up, and a cascade of blond hair falls in front of her face. Upon realizing her helmet is gone, her face registers at first a look of shock, and then of resignation. \"Well, I guess the charade is up, isn't it?\" she says softly, with a sigh. Selena is too shell-shocked to speak. You laugh. The pair both turn to you.\n\n\n\"What's so funny?\" the knight asks.\n\n\n\"You do realize your chances would probably have been much better had you just not hidden your identity.\" you explain.\n\n\n\"What happened?\" Selena finally asks.\n\n\n\"What do you mean, \"what happened\"?\" you and the knight say at the same time. You look at the knight. She shrugs.\n\n\n\"What made you don your armor? What was the last straw? The knight pauses. \"You can tell us over dinner.\" Selena suggests. \"After all, we've got some fresh...boar... to eat.\"\n\n\nThe knight smiles in spite of Selena's evident squeamishness (or perhaps because of it). \"I'd love to,\" she says.\n\n\nYou eat in silence for a while\"So, you were wondering what happened?\" the knight says, her voice almost a murmur.\n\n\n\"Go on,\" Selena encourages.\n\n\n\"Where do I start? Well, my father had always wanted a boy. When my mother died in childbirth and I was a girl, I think he made his belief, there and then, that girls were good for nothing.\n\n\n\"When I was five years old, we moved to a new town. I was in the park when a neighbor asked who my parents were, since they weren't there. I told them who my father was, but they said, 'That's impossible. He doesn't have any children.' When I confronted him about it, he said that one girl hardly counted. From then on, I figured that if I was like a boy, my father might think I counted.\n\n\n\"At seven years old, I cut my hair short and asked for an apprenticeship 'learning weapons', which meant the local swordsmaster, blacksmith, and bowyer all apprenticed a group of kids, and whichever was the best at any given trade?\u2014say, archery?\u2014would be the apprentice of the respective master?\u2014say, the bowyer.\n\n\n\"In church, I was taught that whoever lied would eventually be found out, and I figured the same would apply to my being female. So, I aimed to be so good that even if I was a girl, they would have no choice to accept me. I was always the firat one to arrive and the last one to leave. I was there even when I didn't need to be. Every task, no matter how mundane, humiliating, or difficult, I strove to be the best at. And even though I was probably better at every task than the others, I didn't stop. For a while, I let it consume me.\n\n\n\"At this point, I had built a relationship with the blacksmith and I felt I could trust him, apprentice to master. I told him that I was a girl and begged him to let me stay in the apprenticeship. He seemed a bit surprised, saying that it didn't matter whether you were a girl or a boy, only that you were good at your trade. 'As long as you're good, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't have a trade,' he said.\n\n\n\"Somehow or other, word got out that I was a girl. But the blacksmith would vouch for me every time they tried to end my apprenticeship. But at sixteen, everybody had to complete one final task to prove they were truly masters of their craft. Mine was to rescue the princess. There, they said I could end it, give up. I could go back to a life as a maid or a housewife, not have to deal with the pressure. But there was no way those pigs were going to tell me what to do. They refused to give me weapons, so I went from town to town, looking for work as a blacksmith. Eventually, I saved up enough to make my own. They told me that the king would never accept my help and that I wouldn't come back alive. Well...\n\n\n\"Before I left the town, my father saw me in my armor. I thought he might finally be proud of me.\" Her expression darkens. \"Let's just say I was wrong.\"\n\n\n\"And here I thought the only way to deal with my problems was running away,\" Selena says, a thoughtful expression on her face. There's silence for a moment. \"I should tell my parents what I wanted all along,\" Selena suddenly says. \"I should tell them that I just wanted to be free to make my own decisions,\" she continues, a rising fervor growing in her voice. \"But that it wasn't right to cause them so much worry because of what I wanted.\"\n\n\nShe looks like she might say something more, but the knight interjects. \"Well, don't say it to us, say it to them!\" Selena rises from the table, a determined look on her face.\n\n\nYou soar through the skies, which are painted in an array of colors by the morning sun. Selena gasps in awe, sitting in a basket she's made for you to hold. She reaches out, almost as if to touch the trails of blue and pink surrounding you. The knight, however, is gripping the sides of the basket tightly. She looks terrified, even though you can't see her face on account of the oversized helmet atop her head.\n\n\nYou set down the basket before touching down on the fields surrounding the palace, still moist with dew. The knight is the first one to climb out. She lets out a huge sigh of relief. Selena steps out gracefully. \"You ready?\" the knight asks.\n\n\n\"No,\" Selena answers, \"But let's do it anyway.\"\n\n\nYou soar off. You'll be watching from the pool. Still, you feel like you're missing out on some of the action. Oh well.\n\n\nBy the time you return to the pool, the skies are now a bright blue and the sun is up in the air. \"Show me Selena,\" you declare, realizing the knight never told you her name. You can't blame her.\n\n\n\"Thanks for the pep talk,\" Selena says to the knight. \"I'm good to go now.\"\n\n\nThe pair walk right up to the massive gates of the castle. \"The princess has returned!\" the knight proclaims loudly, startling awake some guards sleeping on the job.\n\n\n\"Pardon me?\" one of the guards asks.\n\n\n\"She has been saved from the dragon,\" the knight says, back to her fake deep voice. The news spreads like wildfire. Not even five minutes later, the king and queen come running out, still in their pyjamas.\n\n\n\"Selena?\" the queen murmurs. The king turns to the knight, gratitude written on his face. \"Our kingdom owes a great debt to you. You are certainly worthy of being the next heir\u2014\"\n\n\n\"Father,\" Selena interrupts, \"Before we continue, there are a few things I must say. I wasn't captured by the dragon. I staged the capture.\"\n\n\nThe king doesn't know what to say. \"I\u2014but\u2014\"\n\n\n\"However, it wasn't right of me to put you through such stress just because of what I wanted,\" she continues. \"With that in mind, what I wanted wasn't riches or wealth. It wasn't a title or fame.\" Selena pauses for a moment. \"All I really wanted, and that which I still want now, is the freedom to make my own decisions, though they may not be the best ones I make. I want to decide if I will get married, and who I will get married to. I want to do things that are ridiculous, things out of the ordinary. Will you let me do those things?\"\n\n\nThe king's expression is at first of shock, then of resignation. \"The dragon has meddled her mind, I see. We must keep her here until we can heal her mind from its poison.\" You roll your eyes.\n\n\n\"I thought you might say that,\" Selena says with disappointment. \"Though I was rather hoping you'd say something different,\" she continues, a wistful look in her eyes. \"Mother understands, but you don't.\" The queen nods, tears in her eyes. \"When will you learn? Nobody can keep me locked up in a tower.\" Her eyes go to the sky, and she looks directly at you with a small smile. \"You can't keep me here against my will. Maybe one day, I'll come back. But I'm free now.\" She starts performing the actions of a spell, one that you've seen her practice many times. \"Watch me fly,\" Selena morphs into a bright blue bird and takes to the air.\n\n\nSelena pulls a bright blue feather out of her hair. \"That spell took a lot more effort than I thought it would,\" she sighs. \"Am I losing my touch?\" she wonders aloud. She looks exhausted. You can't blame her. Even after managing the transformation to a bird and back, she still is working on the knight's gift, which requires a lot of magic on her part.\n\n\n\"Get some rest,\" you order. \"You're not on a deadline and you have barely any endurance.\"\n\n\n\"Endurance?\" Selena asks.\n\n\n\"Channeling magic isn't easy,\" you say. \"It takes a toll. You're only performing lower-tier spells currently, but powerful spells can leave a person unconscious for days.\"\n\n\n\"Alright,\" she agrees, too tired to argue. \"But I swear I felt something, like I had the capacity to do it with ease, but like something is blocking the magic, making it really hard for any to come through. Like... water trickling through a dam.\"\n\n\n\"I wouldn't know anything about it,\" you say, \"I've never performed magic the way you do. Now, get some rest. You need it.\"\n\n\n\"Aye, aye, Captain Eryllis,\" she says in what you think is supposed to be a joking manner, but you can't tell. Her voice has taken on that monotone quality humans have when they've been tired the whole day. It's early evening, but Selena will be lucky if she gets up before noon. \n\n\nYou turn to the knight, who is fashioning a hood of leather from the skin of the boar. Selena still hasn't told her what it's for. \"Eryllis, huh,\" she says. Yet another person who knows your name. You frown slightly, which the knight, surprisingly, notices.\n\n\n\"I get it. I don't think I've told anyone my real name since I was 10. I've gone by a different name each town.\"\n\n\n\"You're surprisingly intuitive for a human,\" you say. \n\n\n\"Well, I guess I was always good at reading people.\" the knight responds.\n\n\n\"Dragons are people too?\" you ask, half joking.\n\n\n\"Well, since I know your name, I guess I should tell you mine too. I'm Elizabeth.\"\n\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" you say in disbelief.\n\n\n\"There are about zero ways to make that sound like a boy's name, I know.\"\n\n\n\"What's wrong with it being a girl's name?\" Selena asks tiredly. She falls back asleep almost instantly.\n\n\nThe next few days pass in a blur. You ward off other knights who didn't get the message, Selena continues to exhaust herself working on the knight's gift, and the knight\u2014Elizabeth\u2014 practices swordplay in between gathering ingredients for Selena's spells and trying to catch a sneak peek of her gift. There isn't much to look at, though. You're starting to wonder if humans are allergic to relaxing.\n\n\nAfter 10 days, Elizabeth's gift is finally finished. \"Close your eyes,\" says Selena. Elizabeth obliges. You see a hood with a masquerade mask attached. At first it looks indigo, but as you watch it shifts colours in the light, going from indigo to green, and then back to the same brown that the leather was when the hood was first made. Selena places the hood over Elizabeth's head. \"Alright. You can open your eyes now.\" she says, excited.\n\n\nElizabeth opens her eyes and her breath catches in astonishment. \"It's beautiful.\" Elizabeth murmurs.\n\n\n\"It's magical,\" Selena says. \"This hood will ensure others see you for who you want to be seen as.\" \n\n\n\"So... if I want to be seen as a knight in shining armor...\" You expect something to change, but nothing happens.\n\n\n\"It's sort of a mixture of their worldview and your will.

I think I'll heed my own advice and try to work things out with mine.\n\n\n\"Your father... Even after what he did, you still want to make things up with him?\" Selena says in astonishment.\n\n\n\"At the very least, I want to let him know that I am much more than what he thought I was. And I might even 'save' a few more 'damsels in distress'.\" You all chuckle at that one.\n\n\nElizabeth stands at the door, but she seems... hesitant. Like she's waiting for something.", "action_results": [{"action": "Let her stay", "result": "\"Oh, for goodness sake, if you want to stay, just get on with it already!\" you chuckle.\n\n\n\"The family you were born into is important, but the family you choose is even more important,\" Selena adds. \"This is as much your home as it is ours. Though we're not going to stop you from seeking out your birth family... just remember that we'd like to be your chosen family, if you'll have us.\" In response, Elizabeth hugs Selena.\n\n\n\"I'll come back once I've tried talking to him,\" she says. You take to the air, watching the knight make her way through the forest. You circle around the tower and then soar into the sunset.\n\n\n\"And that's how it ends,\" the traveler says.\n\n\n\"I liked that,\" one of the kids says.\n\n\n\"But why can't Selena cast spells without getting tired?\"\n\n\n\"What does the dragon have against the name Elizabeth?\"\n\n\n\"Well, that's a story for another time,\" the traveler says., rubbing a line of green scales along the back of her neck.\n\n\n\"Another time!

And now you're thinking that you're going to defeat me by some clever plan of yours. Then poor peasant boy will suddenly become rich lord, and they'll talk about it in fairy tales afterward. Does that sound about right to you?\" The knight is at first shocked, then angry. (Though it's hard to tell, what with the oversized helmet and all.)\n\n\n\"I have as much right to be here as any of the other knights!\" the knight protests. \"I'm as worthy as they are!\"\n\n\n\"I mean, they weren't really worthy to begin with, so you're setting a real low bar for yourself here.\" you respond dryly.\n\n\n\"If you don't think I deserve to be here, then fight me and see!\" He raises his sword, which is small and light, unlike the swords of the faliures before him.\n\n\nYou draw in breath, intending to knock him out with a burst of poisonous gas, but he's quick. He dives under you and slices his sword across your stomach. It's only a scratch, but none of the other knights have gotten this far. You take to the air. Cursing, he sheathes his sword and draws his bow and arrow. You don't stay put for him to fire at you, though. You spiral through the air, making you rather hard to hit. Even though he's a good shot, the only hits glance off your iron-hard scales.\n\n\nNext, you land in the forest, your green-brown scales blending in perfectly with the forest floor. Evolution has served you well. You hear the knight crashing through the forest (apparently he doesn't care about stealth anymore) and stop moving. He won't see you. He runs up on top of your back and you can practically hear his confusion. The broken branches make it clear that you were here. What he doesn't know is that you still are.\n\n\nYou start moving slowly. He probably thinks it's an earthquake. Unseen, you creep around, ready to strike from behind. The helmet obsures his vision, which must explain why he hasn't noticed you yet. You pounce. The knight turns just in time to notice you and raises his shield up. It crumples under your weight, but he isn't there anymore. You hear a metallic clunk and a curse word as the knight removes her helmet. A cascade of blonde hair tumbles out. So they aren't sending arrogant males, just arrogant people.\n\n\nYou snatch the knight in your claws. Not stopping to let her regain her senses, you take to the air, and soon you're well above the ground. You've got her pinned so tightly that she can't reach her sword. Unfortunately, that isn't her only weapon. She jabs a knife into the flesh surrounding your claws. You roar in pain and instinctively let go. The knight, however, doesn't. You try to bite her, but you're also not particularily keen on biting your claw off, either.\n\n\nThe knight makes a leap of faith. For a second, you think she isn't going to make it, but she catches your wing and throws you off balance. You both hurtle to the ground, you barely managing to slow your fall. You crash to the ground, and she stabs his sword into you. You pin him to the ground. You're both beaten and bloodied.\n\n\n\"Will you both stop!\" Selena says. This is why you didn't want to agree to this. A few more minutes and she might have gotten luckier. As it is, you think she's punctured an organ or something. You're bleeding out.  When you move, a splitting pain tears through you.You won't die, given that the combat doesn't continue, but it's still a grave injury.\n\n\nYou hear a spitting noise from the knight and look down to see that your blood is dripping on her face and that she's trying to block it, but because you still have her pinned, she can't.\n\n\n\"Your blood is\u2014ew\u2014in my\u2014pthah\u2014mouth! It's disgusting!\" she spits.\n\n\n\"May I remind you that you were the one who caused this?\" you retort.\n\n\n\"Well, if you hadn't taken that cheap shot\u2014\"\n\n\n\"Cheap shot? You grabbed my\u2014\"\n\n\n\"You wouldn't even stay on the ground!\"\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, who was the one that said, 'Fight me! I'm\u2014' \"\n\n\n\"I said, will you both stop?!\" Selena shouts, now more annoyed than concerned. Your adrenaline fades, however, and you're left weakened. You crumple to the ground, barely avoiding crushing the knight. Good thing, too, because she looks like she couldn't move a muscle. \"Are you okay?\" Selena asks, her annoyance faded.\n\n\n\"Your parents\u2014pant\u2014have been searching\u2014pant\u2014everywhere for you,\" the knight wheezes. \"But if you\u2014pant\u2014could convince the dragon\u2014pant\u2014to stop attacking, then couldn't you convince him\u2014\"\n\n\n\"Her,\" you correct. \n\n\n\"Her,\" the knight agrees. \"Couldn't you convince her to let you go?\" Selena says nothing. \"So... is this your dragon?\" \n\n\n\"As if,\" you say, rolling your eyes.\n\n\n\"So, you're... not captured?\" the knight says, puzzled.\n\n\n\"It took you long enough to figure that out,\" Selena says.\n\n\n\"But... why? Your family has been searching for you for days. I don't think they've even slept!\" A new stab of pain rolls through you and you groan. The princess rushes over to your side.\n\n\n\"Are you okay? You don't seem okay,\" she asks, genuine concern written across her face. Of course. This knight probably wants to take her back against her will, and she's concerned about you.\n\n\nThe pain intensifies and you decide that if this princess wants to be all altruistic, that's fine with you. \"Hold on,\" says the princess, \"I know a spell,\" You see that the knight is standing up and moving towards Selena. You think about warning her, but you have a sort of apathy that only pain can give.\n\n\nJust as the knight is about to reach Selena, she begins chanting. \"Convers tempo d'ici d'ici, illatum mederi. Hoc est, hoc habet nomen. Voco huicus.\" She reverts to the common tongue. \"I name thee as you were before, with a sharp wit and a willingness to go along with my crazy plan. I name thee queen of these woods and an accomplice to freedom. I name thee Eryllis.\" With that, you suddenly feel all the wounds you got over the past five minutes disappear. Not as if they had been healed, but as if there was never a wound in the first place. Selena collapses, and the knight catches her.\n\n\n\"So...\" she says, looking you up and down, \"You're probably not going to let me return Selena to her parents, are you?\"\n\n\nOnce Selena wakes up, the three of you decide to dine together. Selena's parents can wait. Dinner is mostly silent until Selena suddenly interrupts. \"What was the turning point?\"\n\n\n\"Pardon?\" the knight asks.\n\n\n\"Where did you decide that doing what other people said was not going to happen?\"\n\n\nThe knight considers this. \"Well, my father had always wanted a boy. When my mother died in childbirth and I was a girl, I think he made his belief, there and then, that girls were good for nothing.\n\n\n\"When I was five years old, we moved to a new town. I was in the park when a neighbor asked who my parents were, since they weren't there. I told them who my father was, but they said, 'That's impossible. He doesn't have any children.' When I confronted him about it, he said that one girl hardly counted. From then on, I figured that if I was like a boy, my father might think I counted.\n\n\n\"At seven years old, I cut my hair short and asked for an apprenticeship 'learning weapons', which meant the local swordsmaster, blacksmith, and bowyer all apprenticed a group of kids, and whichever was the best at any given trade?\u2014say, archery?\u2014would be the apprentice of the respective master?\u2014say, the bowyer.\n\n\n\"In church, I was taught that whoever lied would eventually be found out, and I figured the same would apply to my being female. So, I aimed to be so good that even if I was a girl, they would have no choice to accept me. I was always the firat one to arrive and the last one to leave. I was there even when I didn't need to be. Every task, no matter how mundane, humiliating, or difficult, I strove to be the best at. And even though I was probably better at every task than the others, I didn't stop. For a while, I let it consume me.\n\n\n\"At this point, I had built a relationship with the blacksmith and I felt I could trust him, apprentice to master. I told him that I was a girl and begged him to let me stay in the apprenticeship. He seemed a bit surprised, saying that it didn't matter whether you were a girl or a boy, only that you were good at your trade. 'As long as you're good, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't have a trade,' he said.\n\n\n\"Somehow or other, word got out that I was a girl. But the blacksmith would vouch for me every time they tried to end my apprenticeship. But at sixteen, everybody had to complete one final task to prove they were truly masters of their craft. Mine was to rescue the princess. There, they said I could end it, give up. I could go back to a life as a maid or a housewife, not have to deal with the pressure. But there was no way those pigs were going to tell me what to do. They refused to give me weapons, so I went from town to town, looking for work as a blacksmith. Eventually, I saved up enough to make my own. They told me that the king would never accept my help and that I wouldn't come back alive. Well...\n\n\n\"Before I left the town, my father saw me in my armor. I thought he might finally be proud of me.\" Her expression darkens. \"Let's just say I was wrong.\"\n\n\n\"And here I thought the only way to deal with my problems was running away,\" Selena says, a thoughtful expression on her face. There's silence for a moment. \"I should tell my parents what I wanted all along,\" Selena suddenly says. \"I should tell them that I just wanted to be free to make my own decisions,\" she continues, a rising fervor growing in her voice. \"But that it wasn't right to cause them so much worry because of what I wanted.\"\n\n\nShe looks like she might say something more, but the knight interjects. \"Well, don't say it to us, say it to them!\" Selena rises from the table, a determined look on her face.\n\n\nYou soar through the skies, which are painted in an array of colors by the morning sun. Selena gasps in awe, sitting in a basket she's made for you to hold. She reaches out, almost as if to touch the trails of blue and pink surrounding you. The knight, however, is gripping the sides of the basket tightly. She looks terrified, even though you can't see her face on account of the oversized helmet atop her head.\n\n\nYou set down the basket before touching down on the fields surrounding the palace, still moist with dew. The knight is the first one to climb out. She lets out a huge sigh of relief. Selena steps out gracefully. \"You ready?\" the knight asks.\n\n\n\"No,\" Selena answers, \"But let's do it anyway.\"\n\n\nYou soar off. You'll be watching from the pool. Still, you feel like you're missing out on some of the action. Oh well.\n\n\nBy the time you return to the pool, the skies are now a bright blue and the sun is up in the air. \"Show me Selena,\" you declare, realizing the knight never told you her name. You can't blame her.\n\n\n\"Thanks for the pep talk,\" Selena says to the knight. \"I'm good to go now.\"\n\n\nThe pair walk right up to the massive gates of the castle. \"The princess has returned!\" the knight proclaims loudly, startling awake some guards sleeping on the job.\n\n\n\"Pardon me?\" one of the guards asks.\n\n\n\"She has been saved from the dragon,\" the knight says, back to her fake deep voice. The news spreads like wildfire. Not even five minutes later, the king and queen come running out, still in their pyjamas.\n\n\n\"Selena?\" the queen murmurs.\n\n\nThe king turns to the knight, gratitude written on his face. \"Our kingdom owes a great debt to you. You are certainly worthy of being the next heir\u2014\"\n\n\n\"Father,\" Selena interrupts, \"Before we continue, there are a few things I must say. I wasn't captured by the dragon. I staged the capture.\" The king doesn't know what to say. \"I\u2014but\u2014\" \"However, it wasn't right of me to put you through such stress just because of what I wanted,\" she continues. \"With that in mind, what I wanted wasn't riches or wealth. It wasn't a title or fame.\" Selena pauses for a moment. \"All I really wanted, and that which I still want now, is the freedom to make my own decisions, though they may not be the best ones I make. I want to decide if I will get married, and who I will get married to. I want to do things that are ridiculous, things out of the ordinary. Will you let me do those things?\"\n\n\nThe king's expression is at first of shock, then of resignation. \"The dragon has meddled her mind, I see. We must keep her here until we can heal her mind from its poison.\" You roll your eyes.\n\n\n\"I thought you might say that,\" Selena says with disappointment. \"Though I was rather hoping you'd say something different,\" she continues, a wistful look in her eyes. \"Mother understands, but you don't.\" The queen nods, tears in her eyes. \"When will you learn? Nobody can keep me locked up in a tower.\" Her eyes go to the sky, and she looks directly at you with a small smile. \"You can't keep me here against my will. Maybe one day, I'll come back. But I'm free now.\" She starts performing the actions of a spell, one that you've seen her practice many times. \"Watch me fly,\" Selena morphs into a bright blue bird and takes to the air.\n\n\nSelena pulls a bright blue feather out of her hair. \"That spell took a lot more effort than I thought it would,\" she sighs. \"Am I losing my touch?\" she wonders aloud. She looks exhausted. You can't blame her. Even after managing the transformation to a bird and back, she still is working on the knight's gift, which requires a lot of magic on her part.\n\n\n\"Get some rest,\" you order. \"You're not on a deadline and you have barely any endurance.\"\n\n\n\"Endurance?\" Selena asks.\n\n\n\"Channeling magic isn't easy,\" you say. \"It takes a toll. You're only performing lower-tier spells currently, but powerful spells can leave a person unconscious for days.\"\n\n\n\"Alright,\" she agrees, too tired to argue. \"But I swear I felt something, like I had the capacity to do it with ease, but like something is blocking the magic, making it really hard for any to come through. Like... water trickling through a dam.\"\n\n\n\"I wouldn't know anything about it,\" you say, \"I've never performed magic the way you do. Now, get some rest. You need it.\"\n\n\n\"Aye, aye, Captain Eryllis,\" she says in what you think is supposed to be a joking manner, but you can't tell. Her voice has taken on that monotone quality humans have when they've been tired the whole day. It's early evening, but Selena will be lucky if she gets up before noon. \n\n\nYou turn to the knight, who is fashioning a hood of leather from the skin of the boar. Selena still hasn't told her what it's for. \"Eryllis, huh,\" she says. Yet another person who knows your name. You frown slightly, which the knight, surprisingly, notices.\n\n\n\"I get it. I don't think I've told anyone my real name since I was 10. I've gone by a different name each town.\"\n\n\n\"You're surprisingly intuitive for a human,\" you say. \n\n\n\"Well, I guess I was always good at reading people.\" the knight responds.\n\n\n\"Dragons are people too?\" you ask, half joking.\n\n\n\"Well, since I know your name, I guess I should tell you mine too. I'm Elizabeth.\"\n\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" you say in disbelief.\n\n\n\"There are about zero ways to make that sound like a boy's name, I know.\"\n\n\n\"What's wrong with it being a girl's name?\" Selena asks tiredly. She falls back asleep almost instantly.\n\n\nThe next few days pass in a blur. You ward off other knights who didn't get the message, Selena continues to exhaust herself working on the knight's gift, and the knight\u2014Elizabeth\u2014 practices swordplay in between gathering ingredients for Selena's spells and trying to catch a sneak peek of her gift. There isn't much to look at, though. You're starting to wonder if humans are allergic to relaxing.\n\n\nAfter 10 days, Elizabeth's gift is finally finished. \"Close your eyes,\" says Selena. Elizabeth obliges. You see a hood with a masquerade mask attached. At first it looks indigo, but as you watch it shifts colours in the light, going from indigo to green, and then back to the same brown that the leather was when the hood was first made. Selena places the hood over Elizabeth's head. \"Alright. You can open your eyes now.\" she says, excited. Elizabeth opens her eyes and her breath catches in astonishment.\n\n\n\"It's beautiful.\" Elizabeth murmurs.\n\n\n\"It's magical,\" Selena says. \"This hood will ensure others see you for who you want to be seen as.\" \n\n\n\"So... if I want to be seen as a knight in shining armor...\" You expect something to change, but nothing happens.\n\n\n\"It's sort of a mixture of their worldview and your will. If they already see you as a knight in shining armor\u2014\" She casts a glance in your direction\u2014\"Their perception won't change.\"\n\n\nElizabeth gathers her things and prepares to leave\u2014until she runs into Selena. \"You're going?\" Selena asks, puzzled.\n\n\n\"You tried to patch up things with your family.

Although the girl told you not to kill him, that doesn't mean you can't have some fun.\n\n\nHe's riding on a white horse and he's wearing armor that looks like it's never been used. He's carrying an enormous sword, the idiot. It'll slow him down and be virtually useless for blocking attacks. He also isn't wearing a helmet\u2014the better to smile at the princess with, though that might actually have been a smart move, considering that helmets can block vision.\n\n\n\"Fair princess,\" he begins. \"I am Sir Hildebrant and I have come to save thee from\u2014\" FWOOMP. You snatch the guy right off his horse, who gallops away in terror. Smart horse. The knight tries to reach for his sword, but you've got him pinned so tightly, he can't move. You fling him far away, into the Eckbel bog.\n\n\n\"I told you not to kill him!\" the girl exclaims hysterically.\n\n\n\"Relax. I know my own strength.\" you state.\n\n\n\"Show me Hildebrant!\" she demands. The pool swirls, and shows a knight flying through the sky. He lands in the bog, sinking deep in the mud. For a moment, you think he might not resurface, but then you see a mop of mud-caked hair emerge, and you know he'll be fine.\n\n\n\"Right over my new armor, too! I didn't think it would be a real dragon!\" he whines. You chuckle. \"What did he think I would be, a stuffed dragon?\" The girl giggles in response.\n\n\nYou both had a good laugh as the upstart tried to explain himself to the king and queen. \"I fought valiantly, but in the end I had to flee.from the dragon. I barely escaped with my life.\"  he explained.\n\n\n\"Shut up,\" you say, \"You were fine.\"\n\n\n\"Why are you covered in mud?\" the queen asks.\n\n\n\"Well\u2014I\u2014you see\u2014\" he stammers.\n\n\n\"You are not fit for my daughter,\" the king declares. The image in the pool disappears.\n\n\nThe next few knights are of a similar standard. You dispatch them all easily. On one sunny morning, however, comes a knight of a different caliber...\n\n\nYou don't even see him coming. Instead of coming through the path, he snuck through the woods. \"Dragon,\" you hear him call. You whirl around, only to see a small figure, much skinnier than the others. His armor is too big for him and you almost feel sorry for him. He doesn't look like much more of a threat than the girl.  \"I wish not to harm you,\" he continues, evidently disguising his voice to make it sound deeper than it actually is. \"Will you hear me out?", "action_results": [null, {"action": "Tell him to go home.", "result": "\"Go home, buddy.

Good thing, too, because she looks like she couldn't move a muscle. \"Are you okay?\" the girl\u2014the princess\u2014asks, her annoyance faded.\n\n\n\"Your parents\u2014pant\u2014have been searching\u2014pant\u2014everywhere for you,\" the knight wheezes. \"But if you\u2014pant\u2014could convince the dragon\u2014pant\u2014to stop attacking, then couldn't you convince him\u2014\"\n\n\n\"Her,\" you correct. \n\n\n\"Her,\" the knight agrees. \"Couldn't you convince her to let you go?\" The princess says nothing. \"So... is this your dragon?\"\n\n\n\"As if,\" you say, rolling your eyes.\n\n\n\"So, you're... not captured?\" the knight says, puzzled. \"It took you long enough to figure that out,\" the princess says. \"But... why? Your family has been searching for you for days. I don't think they've even slept!\" A new stab of pain rolls through you and you groan. The princess rushes over to your side. \"Are you okay? You don't seem okay,\" she asks, genuine concern written across her face. Of course. This knight probably wants to take her back against her will, and she's concerned about you.\n\n\nThe pain intensifies and you decide that if this princess wants to be all altruistic, that's fine with you. \"Hold on,\" says the princess, \"You'll be okay,\" You see that the knight is standing up and moving towards the girl. You think about warning her, but you have a sort of apathy that only pain can give. The knight grabs the princess. \"What are you doing?\" she screams.\n\n\n\"I know you think you're making the right choice, but it shouldn't be at the expense of the people who love you,\" the knight shouts. The princess tries to do something, perhaps cast a spell or run away, but the knight holds on to her arm with a vise grip. You slowly get up, but a new wave of pain courses through you, forcing you to the ground once more. You watch, helpless, as the princess is carried away towards a future you know she didn't want. \n\n\nFor all their great power and might, dragons are annoyingly slow healers. You managed to get yourself to a safe spot where your natural camouflage hid you... and then you stayed there. For weeks on end. You've lost track of time and you're hungry. It can wait\u2014after all, you've survived for months without food before. You're impressed that the knight managed to wound you this badly. You're thankful it's gone from a stabbing pain to a dull ache.\n\n\nBut despite your pain, you can't stop thinking about the princess. You're not sure if it was that you didn't complete your end of the bargain\u2014though you have double-crossed people before. But this time, it wasn't intentional. Her face flashes through your mind as it looked when the knight dragged her away. Why can't your stupid conscience just shut up? You get up for the first time in weeks and stretch. Your injury has barely scaled over. You feel a plan starting to form\u2014Hold up! Who ever said you had to do something about the princess? Most likely she's fine.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ignore your conscience. She'll be fine.", "result": "You stay where you are.

The knight declined the king's offer of his daughter's hand, only to be scorned for giving up such an opportunity. The dragon went back to her typical life. I wish I could say they all lived happily ever after, but they weren't ever quite satisfied with what they had and the choices they had made.\"\n\n\n\"That's a terrible ending!\" one of the children exclaimed.\n\n\n\"The dragon should have rescued the princess,\" another proclaimed.\n\n\n\"Wait, isn't the knight supposed to rescue the princess?\"\n\n\n\"No, the knight captured the princess.\" \n\n\nThe traveler chuckled to herself. \"What's so funny?\" the kids inquired.\n\n\n\"Now, now, I think it's time we let the traveler get some rest,\"  one of the moms told the kids.\n\n\n\"But that wasn't a good ending!\" one of the kids pleaded.\n\n\n\"Please, another story! Please?\"\n\n\n\"Don't worry,\" the traveler said. \"The story I told you isn't what actually happened, but what could have happened.\" And am I thankful for it, the traveler thought as she rubbed the green scales on the back of her neck.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Follow your conscience and stage a rescue!", "result": "If you're right, the legends about you are greater than your actual capabilities, which means you might not even have to fight your way in, which is your second-favorite type of fighting.

You arrive at the main gate and sum up your imperious I am the best of them all voice. \"I demand to see the ruler of this kingdom and his daughter,\" When the guards don't respond, frozen with fear, you decide to humor yourself. \"NOW!\" you shout, causing the guards to run in fear\u2014towards the throne room, you hope.\n\n\nWhen the king and the princess come out, you look directly at the girl and give her an almost imperceptible nod. Her eyes widen in understanding and before you can get a word out, she starts speaking to you. \"I understand you have come to collect your end of the bargain,\" she says, pretending to be afraid.\n\n\n\"What bargain?\" the king demands.\n\n\n\"I told the dragon to spare any knights that came, and the knight that rescued me was no different.\"\n\n\nYou take parole. \"In exchange, she promised to be my prisoner. When she asked to see her parents once more, I figured it was a reasonable request, but that she must return.\"\n\n\n\"I don't want her to hurt you,\" the princess pleads.\n\n\n\"And I do not wish to harm you, either. But if you do not hold up your end of the bargain, I will torch this town to the ground.\" You're bluffing, of course. Only red dragons breathe fire. You breathe a gas that paralyses the nerves for a short period of time. But you're hoping that the king doesn't know much about red dragons.\n\n\n\"We can't lose you again,\" the king says, heartbroken.\n\n\n\"You are not losing her,\" you say. \"You are letting her go. I shall see that no harm comes to her,\" The queen runs up.\n\n\n\"Be brave,\" she whispers, hugging her daughter.\n\n\nBack at the tower, you ask the princess an important question. \"Is this what you wanted?\" You did, essentially, capture her. \"I think so. Did you mean what you said about seeing that no harm comes to me?\"\n\n\n\"Absolutely not.\" You shake your head. \"If you don't run into harm, you won't know what can hurt you, and then I'll have to babysit you for the rest of eternity.\"\n\n\n\"I do not need a babysitter!\" she exclaims.\n\n\n\"My point exactly,\" you respond.\n\n\n\"And so, the dragon and the princess became good friends.  The princess left messages for her family, saying that she was happy and well.  And they all lived\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What about the knight?

You're too stupid, brave, or both to merit any chance of survival in the woods.

That arrogant wizard put wards on his tower to prevent dragons from entering. The wizard is long gone, but the wards still remain. You hope that someday they will run out of magic and fall, but so far, nothing. He was a powerful wizard, too, and there's bound to be some good magical loot in the tower.

I've already found my own place.\" You curse yourself for not making the connection sooner. You've seen many more humans enter the forest since she did, demanding to know, \"Where is she? Who has her?\" (Of course, most of them ended up peppered with elven arrows.) You should have connected the searchers with this girl, who is evidently a high rank among her people. \"And don't even think about trying to take over this tower. This is my turf.\" You almost laugh at the idea that this is her turf. She left \"her turf\" for these woods. This is your turf, not hers. Still, you can wait. You fly off and forget about the girl. After all, she'll expire in a few decades.\n\n\nA few weeks later...\n\n\nIt's a rainy day, which you particularily enjoy because you get to watch the humans tromp through the Eckbel bog, their boots getting stuck in the mud. You could watch them for hours... but suddenly something catches your attention. The smell of sulfur. You turn and see an imp, a sort of servant devil. You bite its head off, and immediately spit it out in disgust. It dissipates in a wisp of smoke. You're immediately on high alert. There's only one place where that creature could come from.\n\n\nWithin minutes, you're at the tower, looking inside and discovering a portal. The girl is gone. Of course. She opens a portal, and it has to be to the Nine Hells. You fly in to get a closer look and realize the wards are down, permitting you to enter the tower. Unfortunately, that's hardly your main concern. You don't want some devil coming through and deciding to conquer the world. You start looking for the mechanism to close the portal. After a few minutes of frantic searching, you find it. You're about to turn it off when you notice something. They took the girl. They didn't kill her. That must mean she has something they want. And devils are not one for unnecessary actions. They would not risk an appearance on Midsta for nothing.\n\n\nSo, you have a gamble. You could close the portal, leaving the girl trapped but preventing any more devils from crossing through. Or you could enter, and see what they want with the girl. It's bound to be a risky play, for someone could shut the portal behind you, leaving you trapped.

Immediately the heat hits you. Fireballs rocket from the sky in the distance. You hope none of them hit you. You see four imps carrying the girl and another demon coming to meet them. They're on a ridge of a deep chasm, but you can fly, so it shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\nImmediately after you fly into the chasm, there are problems. There's a downdraft leading deeper into the chasm. You're not anxious to find out where it leads, but you also don't want to attract attention. Which is rather hard when you're not in your element. And no, fire and brimstone is not your element. \"What do we have here?\" The devil is speaking the common tongue, so even though he's not looking at you, you know he's saying it for your benefit. He runs a clawed finger against her neck, and for a moment you think he's going to slit her throat. Then you see him lift up the girl's necklace.

You've never seen a dragon without their magic.\n\n\nThe girl's hair is floating above her head and her hands are starting to glow. You might as well just leave her here, but you need her magic to open the portal if it closes again. You dive toward the demons surrounding the girl, unleashing a burst of toxic gas. It paralyses them and you shove them into the void as they fall, but it tires you way more than it should. You snatch the girl in your claws and you can feel the magic rippling from her. It's stronger than you've seen in any human, but you don't have time to worry about it now. You try to evade the imps coming at you from all directions as you make your way to the portal. The opening grows ever-smaller.\n\n\nSpells are hurling at you from every direction. Most do no damage and only a few actually hurt. Still, it slows you down. You're almost to the portal when you touch down and immediately, you're surrounded. You plow through a few ranks of imps. You're hoping to be gone by the time more powerful demons arrive. The portal dwindles ever-smaller the closer you get and you realize you're not going to make it. That's what you're counting on the girl for.\n\n\nShe exceeds your expectations. She lifts her hand, and a shockwave rolls through the ground, causing hundreds of imps to fall. She gestures her other hand, and the portal reopens. She enters, and you follow. You are not staying in this infernal plane a second longer.\n\n\nYou both collapse on the floor of the tower, breathing heavily. The initial rush of magic seems to have faded, and now you're left with a semi-unconscious girl and a portal mechanism. You had the good sense to close the portal before you collapsed on the floor, because there's no way you could have gotten back up to close it now. You lay there for a few minutes, just breathing and waiting. Eventually you manage to get up and inspect the girl.
