A group of rebellious clergy men who separated themselves from Rome and settled in Avignon France claiming that the pope Bonafice was a heretic; and that they were the true pope of the Christendom. This had been an ongoing political issue during the time of your father\u2019s reign. You remember seeing your father giving an eloquent speech to the clergy of Bohemia and reassuring them of his support in the true Pope. Though currently you\u2019re short on options.

My father, god rest his soul, was the man of legends. He was gifted and destined by our lord to guide us to legacy. However during his reign, he was blinded by pope Bonafice. Since he was a child, he was taught to have unconditional love and support to the pope regardless of one\u2019s own personal expectations. That was a time of blind faith. Today however, we aren\u2019t bound by this one sided belief; and I can say this with certainty that the current pope is undeserving of his post. I am not blinded with one-sided faith like my father was; and I believe that the true pope who follows the principles of piety and devotion is not pope Bonafice of Rome but the pope of Avignon. It would be for the benefit of this fiefdom, and for the Christendom if we accepted this fact.\u201d The priests are surprised and shocked to hear this.

However, Herr Zubrech has demanded a 50% reduction, which is a bit outrageous. However, he has the best archers in the realm, along with a very good number and quality of artillery. The decision is upto you mein Herr.\n\n\nThe lords preferring the path of neutrality, are stubborn and did not wish any part of the war. I promised them that their lands would come to no harm by providing a manpower; but they did not budge. I believe if you could give them your word, they wouuld agree; however Herr Divish of Talmberg refuses to budge and is also trying to convince our supporting lords against their decision.\n\n\nSurprisingly, quite a few of the rebellious nobles attended the council; but refused to speak to anyone other than the king.

Does he not have even a droplet of care for his family? \n\n\nAfter closing your eyes for a moment and taking a deep breath you recall memories of your childhood, and your little brother.

However, it is not located in the major town of Millvesko, but a miles south of it in the forest.

The hall is filled with echoes of guttural yells and wails of pain and agony. One of the lords removes his concealed dagger and tries to deflect away the thrust of the spear,  but he was too slow and the point goes right through his gut; casing him to wail in agony and pain. Soon, the hall is strewn with the lifeless bodies of the nobles ridden with holes in their abdomen.\n\n\n\"Mein herr, I'm afraid things didn't go as planned.\"\n\n\n\"They should've thought twice before supporting treason, Edward\"\n\n\n\"I know mein Herr, but-\"\n\n\n\"Don't give me excuses in favour of these pathetic scum.

You haven't heard a word from little Sigi from over a month now. After patiently waiting for his arrival for 4 full days, the food and drink kept in preparation for his arrival has begun to rot.

Meanwhile, however another grave issue has come at hand...\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me the royal treasury has diminished?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, mein Herr.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDue to the ongoing civil war and...other factors; most of the lords have reduced to pay their annual  tithes to the crown.

The Benedictine Abbey of Kladruby.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThe abbey of Kladruby? Do you jest with me? Or do you suggest that priests have the holy power from the lord himself to create gold out of nothing?\u201d\n\n\nCompletely oblivious to your blatant heresy, he continues, \u201cThe abbey of Kladruby needs a favour from the crown, for which he would be willing to pay generously. You would get a better picture of the whole idea if you meet him in person mein Herr. Do I have the permission of presenting him in court tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\nNo matter how dubious this seems, you currently have no alternatives. \u201cVery well, you have my permission.\u201d\n\n\nNext day during court, the treasurer is accompanied by a man dressed in the robes of the parish.

Profit that I would willingly share with my allies.\u201d\n\n\nThe Avignon Papacy. A group of rebellious clergy men who separated themselves from Rome and settled in Avignon France claiming that the pope Bonafice was a heretic; and that they were the true pope of the Christendom. This had been an ongoing political issue during the time of your father\u2019s reign. You remember seeing your father giving an eloquent speech to the clergy of Bohemia and reassuring them of his support in the true Pope. Though currently you\u2019re short on options.
