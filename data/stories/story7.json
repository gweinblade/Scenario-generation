The start of summer is upon the villiage of Aravon. You, unlike most people of the village, have a dragon. Redscale has been in your care for several years now. You came upon him as hatchling when he was being attacked by a wild boar. Your long bow you had killed the giant boar in a single shot. You were ready for the dragon when you realized that he was no more than a baby. You took him to your house. That was a wise choice. You no longer have to worry of robbery. You two been best of friends since that faithful day.\n\nDragons in this land are common. They vary in size depending their age. Not many hang around humans because of their past war with dragons. The two races had disagreements that when one king went too far war was declared by dragons. It ruined may kingdoms and the caves of dragons. Until the war exhausted both of them they settled on leaving each other alone. Though some humans found ways to work with them. Together they built houses, discovered new medicine, and worked to get a better understanding of the world.\n\nNormally he'd be outside hunting around the time you get up. So you go outside to see the flowers bloom and a humid smell in the air. Clouds were in the sky. It might start to rain. Better get a coat just in case, you think. You live a hundred meters from Aravon. Near the edge of a great forest known as Valkar Forest. You get a coat and head out.\n\nYou get an axe. You go to start chop some wood for a fire when a blinding flash of light beams up in front of you. A snarling wolf demon appears and stares at you. Demons have appeared when the dragon war was ended by the humans that wanted power. Though the Royal Court of Varon put an end to it. Or most of it. All you have to defend yourself is a axe for cutting wood. You have your bow and sword inside. Still you prepare for battle. \"Don't bother to fight me Human.\" it sneers at you. \"You think you can kill me with an axe. I wouldn't try.\"\n\nYou stare at the beast, focused and concentrated. You were taught to stay calm at all times. \"What do you want demon?\"\n\n\"To talk to you about your pet dragon.\" It replies. \"We caught him.\"  You stand there. How could they catch him? Who would want to mess with you two? \" Where is he? \"I'll find him and kill whoever did this.\" you say.\n\n\" Go to Igor's tower and you'll find whom you seek.\" He disappears in flames leaving you there to think how this could've happened. And why would they just tell you that they took Redscale? It doesn't make sense. You don't have enough time to think about the situation you're in. You'll have to resolve it and fast.\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Get Supplies", "result": "You return to your house to prepare for your journey. Whoever did this has to be very powerful to stop a big dragon like Redscale. You grab your weapons: a sword and longbow. You grab a bag full of coins differing in value.

You see nothing and start to move toward Aravon.\n\n You arrive to see several single storied. You head to the local butcher. He was a rather large man. He goes by the name of Scar. Noone in the village ever found out why he calls himself that. He was skinning a whitetail deer when you entered his house. \"Need something?.\" Scar asked.You sigh. \"I need some meat. Why else would I come here?\" He gets up and looks at you. \"Come\" was all he said.  He says nothing to you as you buy the meat you need for your trip.\n\n \nYou head to the blacksmith who is known to have quivers of arrows. You enter his workshop to a smell of smoke. You never hunted for any animal because Redscale would hunt for you two, so you  never really had any need for arrows. You see the blacksmith hammering a cherry red sword that had to be recently made. You say,\"Sir, I have come in need of some arrows.\" He continues to hammer until its shape is correct. He puts it into a barrel of water and looks at you. \"Sure, you need some for a trip. I'll get you a quiver of usable arrows.\" He returns with your quiver and you pay. \"Thanks.\" is all you say is before you leave.\n\n \nYou head toward the local stable that sells horses. You are looking for a palfrey or known as a riding horse. You see a chocolate colored horse that looks as it was never used. You walk to the stable keeper. \"I want that one.\" You point at the palfrey. \"Well Mister, its one of my finer ones. You have 100 gold pounds with you?\" He asked.  You sigh. Why is every stable keeper here a rip off, you think.  You reluctently give him the amount. You leave with your new companion. You give him the name Amin, the Honest horse.\n\n \nYou ride Amin to your house.

He snorts nervously.\n\n\"Why are you in the forest, young one?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am but a simple peasant.\" you reply.\n\n\"Somehow I doubt that,\" The other one says, \" you would not have weapons like that.\"\n\n\"Gotta protect myself.\"  you say cautiously. You have uneasy feeling about these two. You look at the armor. You look at all the details and see nothing, but you see a sword mark by the heart. You now know what happened. These two must have ambushed a pair of battle-weary knights. By the look of the aromor they tried to fix it, but could not repair the heart wound. \"You two aren't knights! You're bandits!!!\" you yell.\n\n\"Your smarter than you look. The master misread your intelligence. Though we're not bandits, We'Re DeMoNs.\"\n\nNo more words are to be exchanged.

Damn. you think as you hit the ground.  You see a claw come at you to cut you. You grab the arm as its in mid swing and use your leg to kick him. That stuns him for a second and goes to grab your fallen sword. You get up to your knees to see him try to cut your head off.  You duck and give him a leg sweep to try get him down.  It works. He drops the sword and holds  the back of his leg. You get up and pick up your sword. You limp over and look down in disgust. \"You should've left me alone. Your action will cost you your life.\" You raise your sword and cut his head off. He's done. You walk over to the wounded one and say, \"Whoever is your master is as good as dead. I'll spare you to tell him that he better realease Redscale or he's doomed.\" You remount Amin and go across the bridge.\n\nYou know that there's two villages on two crossroads. You come up to one, but the road to Seri is blocked by collapsed trees.

They're afraid of me, you think as Amin walks across a busy street. You make your way to the local inn for any rumors that may help. \n\n The innkeeper is a rather bulky figure. Stories are told of how he trained in the military. He goes by the name of Io. He asks you if you wanted some coffee. Io asked,\"What makes you visit these parts stranger? Not as many folks come in here as the used to.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a certain wizard who has captured a close friend of mine.\" you reply. You don't want to get too detailed. You hear the front door open to see a person come in with a cloak.  The person heads to a croner and sits down. You're curious on who it is.\n\nYour curiosity was shattered by another person at the door come in. This was an angry group of men wielding swords and other kinds of weapons. A tall man, you presume to be their leader, steps up and shouts, \"Where is SHE! There you are you wrench!!\" They head over to the cloaked figure in the corner. You see them pull the hood down. A female sat there.  Knowing that, you stand up and draw your own sword. \"You should leave her alone if I were you.\" you tell him. The leader turns and whispers to two of his men. They come at you  with a axe and club.\n\nYou let them attack you first. The axeman swings the axe at your head. You duck and bring an uppercut to his chin that sends him staggering to the group. The man with the club tries to hit you in the head. It connects and sends you flying to the ground dazed and confused. Looks like I failed my quest. Forgive me Redscale, you think. For a moment there you think you felt a far sense of disappointment from somewhere. Then the woman leaps at the others with a concealed dagger. Within a few seconds, half the men that entered were on the ground, dead or wounded. The man raises the club for the final blow when a dagger thrusts through his heart. You see the woman standing over you, her hand reaching out at you.\n\nYou grab it and she pulls you to your feet. When you got up you got a better look at her. Brown hair that flowed down her back.  Blue eyes that shone with a life energy that you\"ve never seen before in someone. She looks over your shoulder and her eyes widen. \"Come\" is all she says. She dashes up  the stairs of the inn and disappears. You head up the stairs to see her in a room motioning for you to come in. you go in and she says, \"Help me.\" She's trying to barricade the door with the bed. You go over and out the corner of your eye you see a chair.  \"Let's jam the chair in the doorknob.\" you yell.\n\nShe grabs the chair and jams it under the doorknob. Pounding on the door starts and you know men are trying to break in. Fear is swelling inside your body. \"OPEN THIS DOOR!!!\" someone outside the door yells. You start to get angry and your fear is gone.\n\n\"Like that's gonna happen,\" you yell back. The pounding is harder now. \"Explain later. What now?\" you say to your supposed ally.

We get to the stable to see Amin and another horse. It was a dark black. She mounts the horse. \"Do you have a horse?\" She asks. You nod and point at Amin who snorts. \"Nice. Let's go.\" You mount Amin and we head toward the gate.\n\nYou see some men with bows at the gate wall with bows pointed at your companion and you. judging by the distance you estimate a hundred yards. An arrow shoots by your head. Apparently these archers are expert shooters.\n\n\"Don't shoot.\" She says. You look at her in worry.\n\n\"Why?\" you ask.\n\n\"I have some help of my own.\" she says. \"Look to your right.\" You turn your head to the right to see ten archers with crossbows.

You never use it and thought back then how it might come in handy. You take the black  horse and Amin to the stables. You fetch water from a small stream out back. You get some oats and feed them and head back in.\n\nYou return to the cabin and see your friend asleep. You go to your bed and doze off. You have a  dream: You see yourself in front of two shadow figures. \"How could you fail on killing the boy. I've trained him and saw potential. But he's not good enough to slay a demon and wound  one.\" a loud voice roars. To you it seems really familiar, though you can't seem to recall who's voice it is. \n\nA low one who's clearly afraid says, \"But Master... he's far more powerful than you envisioned.  His dragon has made him far too powerful than your magic can predict.\"\n\nAll you can see is black, but the voices remain very clear. \"My magic not strong enough. That is a lie!!! He may be more powerful, but I'm not stupid enough to not believe it.\" You hear a low rumble. You know its Redscale rumbling a warning. You are all too familiar with it.\n\n\"He will save me and when he does. I'll personally tear you limb from limb. Zaron, I know you're your here. Don't give up! Use the power that I saw in you the day we met!\" Tears started to flow down your cheeks.\n\n\"The boy is here!?! Fine. You listen up Zaron. I will have my revenge.

I come from a wealthy family in the royal court of Varon. They were selfish. My OWN family!  They sent me off to marry some Lord Warren I didn't even know. I reluctently agreed to the marrige. As my escort and I neared to his lands we were taken by suprise by some large group of bandits. My escort was killed and I ran to Xias. Some of the bandits followed me and I bought the cloak you first saw me in from a farmer. I went to the inn you were in. As they entered I prayed someone may help me. When you stood up I thought you were leaving, but you helped me and almost died from it. For that I'm in your debt.\" Kai finished.\n\nYou nod. \"I'm surprised I'm in the presence of royalty. I'd escort you, but I have a mission that demands my immediate attention.\"\n\n\"What mission?\" she asked.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe me anyway.\"\n\nI've seen some crazy stuff.\" You give her a sarcastic look. \"I'm not lying. Tell me of your mission that demands your attention.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to get into deatils, but someone was taken from me.\"\n\n\"You're trying to save someone?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Who?\" You sigh and go to the window to look at the sky. You look at her with a deep sadness.\n\n\"My dragon.\"\n\nThat got her attention. She didn't say a thing so you continue, \"Two days ago Redscale; that's his name, went out hunting and never came back.\"\n\nShe finally was able to speak,\"How do know he didn't just leave.\"\n\nFor once since he was taken you laughed. It didn't last long, but it felt good. You look at her. \"Because we were too close to leave each other without telling one another. Anyway, before I went out to chop wood a flash of light appeared. A wolf demon appeared to give me the news. Then I went to the village for supplies. I headed for Valkor Forest and took the path to Xias for any rumors.

You know how to use a sword and shield?\" She nodded. \"We need a sword for you and two shields. Let's go.\"\n\nYou head out to the stable and mount Amin. She mounts her horse. You ask, \"What's its name?\"\n\n\"Shadow.\" She said. We went in the direction of Aravon.\n\nWe go to the blacksmith. He greets you two and asks what you want. \" Two shields and a sword.\" He comes back with a shield with a red dragon on it and a steel one with the symbol of Varon: an eagle. He asks Kai if she could use it. She grabs it and waits. \"This I made for you personally if the day came.  This battle-ready Red Dragon shield is made of 16 gauge thick steel which will protect you from poundings on any battle field. Its yours without cost. And this is for you girl.\" He uncovers a steel sword on a table and gives it to her.

You make it to a pass up the mountain when you hear you a noise in the bush. You snap you head in that direction and saw more movement. A lesson from Quon to observe everything. Kai was already doing that when the attack came, but you were ready. \n\nGroups of demons varying from animals of all kinds. A bear demon swipes you off Amin and to the ground. You cut at its leg and it goes down. Before you could finish it two more of them were on you. You see Kai kill any demon that came at her with expert cuts. She kills every demon that crossed her path. Something fired inside you that made each swing of your blade and land an instant kill. The first was a bird-demon from the air aiming to pick you up and drop you. A tiger came and clawed at you. You blocked with your shield and cut it apart. They begin to retreat. You can follow them to there hideout or cheak the area for any clues.\n\n                                           ", "action_results": [{"action": "Check for clues", "result": "You go to see if Kai is okay. \"You hurt?\" She shakes her head. \"Yell if anything happens.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?' she asks panting.\n\n\"To search for any clues on how those demons got here.\"\n\nYou leave her while she tends to the horses. You look around to see a large set of footprints. You notice at least twenty humans have been here recently. You look around to see not only humans, but some demon footprints. Satisfied here you look in the direction opposite of which you looked at.\n\nYou go in the opposite direction to see a village there. North of there stood a large sructure you can't identify.  \"Looks like a prison to me, but who's it for?\" you say to yourself. With the information you have it looks like that's your next destination.\n\nYou head to Kai and all you say is \"Mount up. We can't leave those demons.

Thanks.\"\n\n\"Don't have to be a jerk.\"\n\n\"I know. So we go in carefully or charge?\"\n\n    \n \n                                        ", "action_results": [{"action": "Approach carefully", "result": " \n\"Wait here.\" you tell Kai.

I'll go see what's in there. Stay close enough that if I need help. You'll be here. Don't move! Be ready for a fight. I sense a great evil in there.\"\n\nYou go in there to see an old man who's maybe seventy years old. He turns towards you and smiles. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm known by many names. But you may call me Tora.\"\n\n\"Were those your demons?\"\n\n\"Yes.

One was a black dragon, bigger than Redscale. \"Kai!!!\" you shout.\n\n\"You have a partner. His reading said you'd be alone.\" Tora screams.\n\nKai comes by your side. \"No way. I may  never have joined you if I knew this would happen.\"\n\n\"Shall we?\"\n\n\"We shall.\"\n\nYou both leap into action. You cut down any demon that enters your blade's range.

The feeling is preventing you from moving. the black dragon swipes at you. Kai intervenes by blocking the claw with her shield. \"Snap out of it Zaron!! This isn't a dragon. Its a dragon demon!\"\n\n You aren't able to keep its tail from smacking her across the room. She hits the wall and falls to the floor motionless. That angers you to see it do that. Whatever pity you have for it is gone now. It goes in the direction of Kai to finish the job. You run in its path and yell, \"You want her? You'll have to go through me first!\"\n\nYou hear a deep rumble in its throat, like a laugh. To your amazement it can talk. \"Go through you first? You can't kill me boy! For I'm no demon, for I'm the KING of all dragons. I'm called Calivir.\"\n\n\"Some king you are. You'll let one of your kind be taken captive? You have no right to be called king!\"\n\n\" NO RIGHT!?!\" Calivir roars.\n\n\"You heard me.\"\n\n\"You don't understand. He's my son. I couldn't convince him to leave you, so I helped capture him.\"\n\n\"You may be his father, but he's my brother.\"\n\n\"You have no right to say that. Your a human and not a dragon.\"\n\nYou shake your head. \"We look out for one another, we argue with each other, we will  risk everything to save each other, and the most important thing: we love each other. I don't need to be a dragon to call him my brother. I know he feels the same way. I feel it. So I have every right to call him my brother.\"\n\n\"Be as that may. I have no choice but to kill you.\" You look him in the eye and see something that shocks you. They have pain and a deep sadness in them. No.... something isn't right, you think.  No one should ever have that look. You try one more time to reason with him. \"You have pain.\"\n\n\"Alas I do. I have to kill my son's brother.\"\n\n\"You have pain that whoever has Redscale may kill him.\"\n\n\"You obviously know how to read a dragon from Redscale. If you defeat me I'll reveal his location to you. If not, you die.\"\n\n \"Very well.\"                                                                          \n\nYou get into a battle stance and Calivir sighs. He wips a claw and it glides across your shield. You cut a swipe at his leg and he flaps his wings to go airborne. He shoots a jet of flame at you. You lift your shield, unsure if it will protect you. It does however hold against the array of flames. You see him land and use his tail to whip at you. You are sent flying into a wall. Can't lose consciousness. You fight the urge to pass out. Calivir walks in your direction and shoots a claw at your chest. It rips your shirt off, but otherwise your uninjured. You grasp your sword for a final strke and cut a deep gash in his chest. Blue blood gushes out and he falls on his side. You fall to your knees after the battle. Kai and Calivir are in your sight. It gets blurry and blurrier by the second.  You think you'll die before you pass out. A dream appears to you: All blackness surrounds you except for a faint red glow. It grows bigger until you see Redscale.\n\n\"Redscale....\"\n\n\"Rise brother.\" He says. You hear passion in his voice.\n\n\"I can't... pain ...too great.\"\n\n\"You must. You must not leave us.

Run towards it and arise from your grave.\" He fades away and you feel tears come up. You hold them in and look around to see a light above you. \"I'm not done. Not by a long shot.\"\n\nYou wake to see Calivir gone and Kai in a corner with a fire. \"I must have been hit by a rockslide.\"\n\nShe hears your voice and jumps up. \"Your alive! But your pulse was gone.\"\n\n\"I was dead, but a friend showed me the light.\"\n\n\"Well Tora was easy to kill. I burned his remains and  disposed off them.
