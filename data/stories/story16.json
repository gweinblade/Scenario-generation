The Adventurer is a tough little ship and veteran of several battles, large enough to hold a Crew of 30 Sailors and 30 days worth of Supplies for them. Although you are only twenty-one years old you have already received the rank of Vice Admiral in recognition of your superb ability and seamanship.\n\n\nThe World of Magellan on which you live is mostly ocean occupied by a scattering of islands:many of these islands are uninhabited but those that are populated are occupied by one of three cultures: native Lapau and more technologically advanced Elixi and Navar, the latter your own people. Though exiled under pain of death from your homeland, the Kingdom of the Three Islands, you have inherited your people's rich naval traditions: the Adventurer carries four cannons and all of your crew are armed with muskets, though these are slow to load making the sword your secondary weapon. Recently war has broken out on Magellan with the Elixi and Navar on one side and you on the other with your allies, the Lapau.\n\n\nYour biggest problem on long voyages is that your ship can only carry enough Supplies for 30 days which will make finding and obtaining fresh sources of Supplies your top priority. If you ever run out of Supplies (your Supply number falls to 0) then you and your Crew will starve to death and die. You will almost certainly lose Crew members during your voyage and you must be careful that your Crew number never falls to 0 either: that will mean that you and all your Crew are dead.\n\n\nFrequently there is a time element involved during your voyages and you will want to complete them in the smallest number of Days possible. Successfully completing a Voyage ahead of your Competitors will result in a Score Point which will show if you leave a Comment after the game that you have completed this story with a very high degree of skill. As in previous adventures you will find it useful to make a map of the waters you sail as you may return this way again and the information may benefit you...\n\n\nSo good luck reader, make wise and strategically sound choices and with a little luck, a good course and a fair wind you might live to see your homeland again!", "action_results": [{"action": "Click here to begin your adventure (pick up the List of Noted Sailors first!)", "result": "It is before dawn the day after Anne-Marie and her allies burned the Lapau Capital of Matan and slaughtered the most of the it's defenders. Lying on your side in bed you watch Naomi sleep, her bare chest rising and falling slowly with every breath. Her head bandage has slipped down her face revealing the shattered ruins of what was once her eyes. Gently you re-adjust it and stroke her hair as someone taps softly on your cabin door. Rising as quietly as you can so as not to wake Naomi you slip on a robe and open the door.\n\n\nSaphia Dancer, Anne-Marie's chief servant and loyal follower stands before you, white teeth flashing in a mischevious smile and she laughs at your expression.\n\n\n\"Close your mouth Admiral, you look like a fish,\" she says quickly, to your surprise you realize it is the first time you have heard her speak and she speaks so rapidly it is difficult to understand her, a clear sign of a quick mind. In the gloom behind her you are surprised to see Ann Lovett and Prince Al-Balu standing by looking strained and nervous. Wondering what on earth is happening you step out of your cabin and close the door quietly.\n\n\n\"We need to be quick as I do not have much time,\" Saphia says swiftly. \"It is better if you let me do the talking as you'll waste too much time with pointless questions if you interject. The situation currently is thus: Anne-Marie considers this War already won. She intends to return to Golden Sands immediately to marry King Shingen and cement her alliance with the Elixi. Prince Kenshin is going back to Revel to make sure all is well and rule the Elixi in Shingen's absence. Prince Ieyasu and I have been given the task of slaughtering you and all that remains of your pathetic and demoralized, not to mention physically unattractive, followers.\"\n\n\nSaphia sighs. \"Now I can think of literally a dozen things I'd rather be doing that killing you and your friends but Ieyasu is a tedious and unimaginative fellow who will take the hunt rather more seriously than he should. Fortunately during our time together at court Ann and I had a little project. It is now ready, or should be nearly so. If you can sail to the island where it is hidden I will try to give Ieyasu the slip and meet you there. I suggest you move off fast because come the morning Ieyasu will be after you like a bloodhound after a fox. I'll try to mislead him all I can but he's not as simple-minded as his brothers and might be harder to trick. Oh and Leo, congratulations on improving your working relationship with Admiral Swift. Lets hope she doesn't go displaying her expertise to the rest of us.\"\n\n\nWith a wink and a short laugh of derision Saphia turns and hurries out to the deck of the Adventurer. You are shocked and glare at Ann expecting an explanation, you are slightly relieved to see Prince Al-Balu looks similarly baffled.\n\n\n\"Saphia and I have an... understanding,\" Ann says awkwardly. \"She's on our side: she knows that Anne-Marie is a tyrant and that it was only a matter of time before she declared war on the Lapau again. For months now we have been secretly sending men, materials and money to an island near the Great Reef which Saphia discovered during her voyage around Magellan. We're building a special kind of ship there... they are standard wooden ships but they have sheets of iron secured around them and tests have shown they are practically impregnable to cannon and gunfire.\"\n\n\nIt takes a few moments for Ann's words to sink in.\n\n\n\"Are you saying these ships are bullet proof?\" you ask finally.\n\n\n\"Essentially,\" Ann replies. \"It was Saphia's idea, she's quite brilliant in her own way. She knows that if Anne-Marie is not stopped she will plunge our world into war and these ships might be the only thing that can stop her. If she's right these ships can defeat Anne-Marie's Monarch of the Sea or any other ship she might have to send against us. With these ships we could capture Golden Sands or Revel or any other port where our enemies might take refuge.\n\n\n\"This is fantastic,\" Al-Balu says in his accented version of your language. \"Wait until my father hears about this.\"\n\n\nFinally feeling that you all have a chance again in your fight against Anne-Marie you return to your bed and snuggle down close to Naomi's warm body. She stirs, smiles and kisses you.

This sounds like we are being invited into a trap.\"\n\n\n\"I can vouch for her,\" Ann says firmly. \"We have been preparing this secret project for months. The island lies to the Southeast of here, not more than a few weeks voyage.\"\n\n\n\"Well these ships may be a good thing but we have other problems right now,\" Al-Capu says and gestures to the hundred or so canoes all around you where the remnants of his people are huddled, most still sleeping after the difficult night. \"My people must be taken to safety and those on my other islands must also be taken to safety before Anne-Marie finds them. How we will feed them I don't know... it has been hard enough finding food for our people these last six months.\"\n\n\n\"Well father why don't we split up?\" Al-Balu suggests. \"We can sail north with our people and Ann can go Southeast to find this island. If these ships are ready she can continue east, attack Revel and then sail through the Western Passage to take Golden Sands. If we continue going north we can meet her there and reunite. After destroying Matan I expect the last thing Anne-Marie and Shingen will be expecting will be an attack on their own Capitals.\"\n\n\n\"It sounds a difficult and risky plan,\" Al-Capu says hesitantly but then sighs. \"It is the only one we have though. We will need a rendezvous point then if we are to attack Golden Sands from the south while Ann Lovett and this Dancer person attack from the west.\"\n\n\n\"I know a convenient place,\" you tell the King. \"West of Golden Sands and south of Amethyst, it is the only point in the Kingdom of The Three Islands that is equal distance from the Southern Passage, Western Passage and Golden Sands. It should take between thirty and forty days of sailing to reach.\"\n\n\n\"This is a very risky plan,\" Al-Capu says heavily. \"If something goes wrong with one of our two forces then the other will arrive in the Waters of the Navar totally unsupported and will be destroyed by Anne-Marie's larger force... we must all make sure we get to this rendezvous point within forty days at the latest and then we can attack Golden Sands together. Very well, Commodore Lovett will go Southeast to find this island while you and I will go north to rescue our people. Admiral Trapa, who will you and Admiral Swift sail with?

You know it must be the right island because the Grand Alliance and Shadow are both anchored offshore. Four other vessels are in sight, a partially dismantled Elixi vessel called the Fortune and three of the strangest vessels you have ever seen in your life. Initially you think they are big round silver balloons floating in the water.\n\n\nThe three vessels do indeed look like big round pots bobbing in the water, though built of wood they are entirely encased in sheets of iron which have been lashed to their sides and also to their decks. One small sail juts out above the metal sheeting. Up close you can see rows of cannons sticking out on both sides. Dropping anchor you and Naomi go ashore to meet with Ann Lovett, Saphia Dancer and a third, wholly unexpected, figure.\n\n\nAnn is striding up and down excitedly on the beach while Saphia is sitting on a log, as always looking amused by life. An Elixi man is standing by, cheerful and middle-aged he is dressed in fine clothes and has a long brown beard. As you lead Naomi towards them Ann strides towards you.\n\n\n\"Aren't they fantastic?\" she says, indicating the three ships. \"Lapau workmen, Elixi wood and Navar metal: a teamwork Anne-Marie could never be capable of has built these ships. Each is crewed with loyal sailors from each Kingdom who have risked their very lives to build these ships and lead them against Anne-Marie's tyranny. With these three ships, the Vengeance, Retribution and Justice nothing can stop us.\"\n\n\nSaphia just smiles and says nothing but your attention is drawn by the strange Elixi man who steps forward with a smile.\n\n\n\"My name is Captain Drake,\" he announces. \"I saw you at Haven Island Admiral but I doubt you'll remember me, I was the second-in-command of Captain Sogo's ship, the Fortune. Well during our voyage to Matan we were attacked by that dog Kenshin and my Captain was killed. We fled south and came upon this island three weeks ago. Learning what was going on here me and my men immediately began dismantling our ship, which was badly damaged, to furnish sails and complete the construction of these vessels. Me and my Crew and entirely under your command sir.\"\n\n\nYou are surprised but pleased to meet this new ally but Saphia suddenly stands up.\n\n\n\"Well this is all fantastic conversation but speed is crucial,\" she declares. \"Revel is our closest target and both myself, Drake and Naomi have all sailed these waters and can guide you to Revel. If we can attack and capture it we can press on through the Western Passage and rendezvous with Al-Capu and Al-Balu off Golden Sands, capture that island, defeat Queen Anne-Marie and bring all our efforts to a happy conclusion that will be celebrated with much joy and happiness all round.\"\n\n\n\"Why don't we just sail west and attack Golden Sands first?\" Naomi asks.\n\n\n\"Because we need to give the Lapau time to get there,\" Saphia declares as one might explain to a child that 2 and 2 make 4. \"No, together me and Ann have made all the plans and they are excellent. All you and your Crews need to do is follow them.\"\n\n\nSlightly startled at being addressed this way and feeling that Saphia has more than a few qualities in common with Anne-Marie you nevertheless prepare your ship and your unusual fleet sets sail the next day each ship towing one of the new war ships, which Saphia calls \"Turtle Ships\".

Indeed the only ship that is still in sight is the iron-clad Vengeance which the Adventurer is still towing. Her Captain Drake comes aboard to talk with you and Naomi\n\n\n\"Well we lost them,\" he says with indecent cheerfulness. \"Not to worry: we aren't more than a week from Elixi waters and less than two from Revel so as long as we keep heading in a generally easterly direction we should run into them sooner or later.

Captain Sogo sacked it during our voyage to Matan, if we want to raid it I doubt they have had time to increase it's defenses since we were last here.\"\n\n\n\"You can raid it if you like,\" Naomi tells you. \"Don't forget our main mission is to reach Revel though.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Raid Ferryland", "result": "You sail the Adventurer and Vengeance directly into the harbor of Ferrytown, the colonists are so surprised by the sight of the strange iron-clad that they offer no resistance when you demand food and promptly deliver three barrels of apples into your hands.

I hope I will be a good Queen but I worry I might not be. I am going to follow my teacher's advice, put these worries in a bottle and cast them into the sea to banish them forever. Renewel.\"\n\n\nWith a start you realize these words must have been written many years ago by Queen Renewel, the mother of Shingen, Kenshin and Ieyasu.

Anchored a short way off and clearly waiting for you is the Shadow with the Retribution in tow and you steer the Adventurer and Vengeance alongside them. Drake and Saphia come aboard, the latter humming a tune to herself as though she had not a care in the world. You and Naomi are more concerned however as there is no sign of Lovett and her two ships.\n\n\n\"Have you seen any trace of Commodore Lovett?\" you ask Saphia who shakes her head without even breaking her tune. You and Drake exchange glances, none of you trust your new ally but Saphia finally stops whistling.\n\n\n\"I have already scouted out Revel Port,\" she tells you. \"Prince Kenshin is there with the Esme's Joy. You need not tax your obviously considerable mental powers because I already have a plan. Kenshin still believes I am his ally. If I sail in towing both iron-clad ships he will be puzzled but should not suspect anything until we open fire on him at point blank range. I would rather tow the Iron-Clads in than the Adventurer because they are more heavily-armed.\"\n\n\n\"You want to take our two iron clads into the heart of the enemy Port while we wait some distance away?\" Naomi asks suspiciously.\n\n\n\"Why anyone would think you don't trust me Admiral,\" Saphia says to Naomi with a laugh. \"By all means if you prefer I could tow the Adventurer into the harbor and attack Kenshin with our two ships. It'll just mean the iron-clads probably won't get to fight and the victory will be harder to win, though probably still possibly. I am only a lowly Commander though so in such exalted company as two Admirals I must let my superiors make their battle plans.\"\n\n\nYou frown at Saphia, there is logic in what she is saying about towing the two iron-clads into the harbor but you wonder how much you can trust her not to hand those ships straight over to the Elixi.

As the two ships pull alongside each other a series of cannon flashes ring out down the side of the Shadow as she fires a point-blank volley into the side of the Esme's Joy. Moments later both the Retribution and Vengeance are able to turn and fire close-range volleys as well.\n\n\nA cheer goes up as the Esme's Joy rapidly sinks. It seems strangely fitting that the thug who blinded in a treacherous ambush should himself fall victim to an ambush but you feel a pang inside as you watch the ship sink. Under her previous Captains Esme Hale and Eva Freer, both close friends of yours, she achieved many great deeds and it is not without regret that you see her sinking. Even in death she is defiant, firing a return volley at the Shadow which brings down it's main mast.\n\n\nAs the Esme's Joy finally vanishes beneath the waves her crew swim for their lives back towards the island of Revel. Most make it but Kenshin is not among them; you later learn he was recognized and shot in the head by a sailor aboard the Shadow.

As the distance between you and your enemies shrinks the bow cannons on both sides begins firing as the event that will be forever known to your people as the Battle of Golden Sands begins. Within minutes all ships are launching cannon balls, musket balls or throwing spears into the ships and men alike in a determined effort to destroy the other.\n\n\nThe King's Canoe is an early casualty: within minutes of fighting the largest Lapau canoe begins to sink suddenly. You are standing on the quarterdeck of the Adventurer with Naomi at your side and scanning the sinking vessel with your telescope you notice something strange: numerous little wooden tubes are sticking out of the water. With a jolt you realize Anne-Marie has cunningly employed divers armed with swords and hollow breathing tubes to stab holes in your ships, an imitation of tactics the Lapau themselves used during your war with them. The Lapau are also recognizing the threat and are trying to cut the breathing tubes below sea level wherever they find them.\n\n\nIf Anne-Marie has her underwater divers you have your turtle ships and both the Retribution and Vengeance perform excellently, cannonballs and musket balls bouncing off them with metallic clangs as they pour their own gunfire into your enemies. Indeed Shingen's Sea Ghost is suffering so badly he deliberately steers it prow-first into the side of the Retribution in a desperate attempt to sink it. Swordsmen pour from the decks of the Sea Ghost onto the Retribution and begin slaughtering the outnumbered crew of the iron-clad.\n\n\nYour Fleet is suffering badly: the King's Canoe has already sunk and many Lapau are being killed in the sea and in their canoes by musket fire. The Sea Ghost and Retribution have become entangled together and both appear to be sinking. Keeping clear of the general melee Anne-Marie's Monarch of the Sea is trading volleys of cannon fire with the Vengeance but here at least your comrade Drake is having the best of the exchange.

Today the three realms of the Elixi, Lapau and Navar have all lost their rulers and you have no idea what will happen next.\n\n\nYou, Drake and Naomi sit down in the Palace's Throne Room and discuss what to do now. The Adventurer and the Vengeance are still sea-worthy and tomorrow you could take on fresh crew and supplies and pursue Anne-Marie. Your main concern is whether Saphia Dancer will keep her promise and assist you. Prince Ieyasu is still a factor: he will reach Revel before you do and if he joins forces with Anne-Marie your problems will begin all over again.\n\n\nWhile you are discussing this a group of prominent citizens of the town approach cautiously. Nervously they tell you at times like this when the Monarch is unable to rule it is tradition to appoint a Regent to rule in their place.

They awkwardly ask what your future plans are and when they learn you intend to pursue Anne-Marie the next day and bring her to justice for her crimes they promise that in your absence a vote will be arranged so that the people of The Three Islands can choose who they wish to rule them.

Ieyasu showed up here about a week ago and my feeble brain managed to generate a bright idea. To enable us to restore peace between the Navar and the Elixi I made the remarkable self-sacrifice of agreeing to marry him! Now just a few days ago, and here's the really funny thing, we found out Ieyasu is the last surviving member of the ruling house of Elixi and therefore, by default, the King of the Elixi. For some strange reason that makes us both King and Queen but you can rest assured Ieyasu has seen the error of his ways and we both intend to live in complete peace with the Lapau and Navar for all time and all that stuff.\"\n\n\nYou are absolutely staggered by the news and it is no wonder that Ieyasu looks so smug, or the crowd at the harbor so resentful but at your side Naomi strides forward angrily towards Saphia.\n\n\n\"This was your plan from the beginning,\" she snaps at Saphia. \"When you and Ieyasu separated off Matan this was your plan all along: you to help capture Revel and Ieyasu to journey here and marry you! You get your own kingdom and Ieyasu gets off the hook! You think we'll just forget he killed Eva Freer and did his best to kill all of us time and again?\"\n\n\nNaomi's rage only seems to make Saphia happier.\n\n\n\"I think you're being rather unkind Naomi,\" she says brightly. \"I'm sure Ieyasu has been a bit naughty in the past but you are forgetting something: without my designs and my ideas Lovett could never have built those iron-clads which we used to capture Revel and which I have just heard you have used to re-take Golden Sands.

I thought it was rather obvious. Also shouldn't you and your friends get busy hunting after Anne-Marie? She stopped here two days ago incidentally and she's awfully mad at you. Seemed to want me and Ieyasu to help her, well you'll be happy to know we think the best thing for the Elixi right now is a period of peace to rebuild their strength. To help ensure this peace it might be best if you find and defeat Anne-Marie as quickly as possible, naturally in the interests of friendships you can resupply your ships here or at any Elixi port you encounter: we've sent word to them all to assist you but refuse Anne-Marie any safe harbor.\"\n\n\nYou raise your gaze to Ieyasu and the attractive woman standing at his side. Ieyasu nods coldly at you while the woman at his side winks and blows a kiss.\n\n\n\"Who's that?\" Drake asks with more than casual interest.\n\n\n\"That is an Elixi lady called Nohime who I'm rather fond of,\" Saphia comments eyes twinkling and you notice Ieyasu doesn't seem too thrilled by her presence. At the sight of the cunning black-clothed Prince your anger rises again.\n\n\n\"We won't forget that he killed Eva Freer,\" you promise Saphia. \"One day he will have to pay for that crime.\"\n\n\n\"Don't wait too long,\" Saphia says quietly and leans closer, lowering her voice. \"It seems to me that the person who finds King Al-Capu or his missing girlfriend Commodore Lovett might be in a rather good position, no? It might be useful if you keep an eye out for them during your hunt of Anne-Marie, if my wonderful new husband finds them first... well, let's just say I'm not sure I can ensure their safety. I'm actually telling you something honest here Leo: I'm rather fond of Ann and would hate for any harm to come to her.\"\n\n\nWith that warning the meeting ends and you spend an uneasy night aboard the Adventurer in Revel Harbor while Saphia's new Elixi subjects re-supply your two ships.", "action_results": [{"action": "The chase turns south", "result": "The next morning you set sail from Revel.\n\n\nQueen Saphia and her lady companion Nohime come down to the dock to see you off but there is no sign of Ieyasu.

We knew if we returned to The Kingdom of The Three Islands Anne-Marie would likely have us killed to ensure our silence so we chose to sail west in search of habitable lands.

I drew my musket and shot at her but alas I was excited and my aim was off so I only grazed her right hip.

A single boat crowded with people is rowing rapidly towards the shore of the rocky island, which is lined with spear-armed Lapau warriors. You can make out the distinctive figure of Ieyasu standing in the prow. He is holding a small figure to him and is pressing a pistol against the figure's blond head.

All at once there is a tussle between Ieyasu and Lovett which ends with Lovett pushing him off and diving into the sea alongside the boat. As she swims away Ieyasu straightens up, points his pistol at her and the next moment he is falling back as the Lapau warrior lets fly with his spear which passes straight through Ieyasu's throat and stays there, half sticking out the front of his throat and half sticking out the back.

Although you are only twenty-one years old you have already received the rank of Vice Admiral in recognition of your superb ability and seamanship.\n\n\nThe World of Magellan on which you live is mostly ocean occupied by a scattering of islands:many of these islands are uninhabited but those that are populated are occupied by one of three cultures: native Lapau and more technologically advanced Elixi and Navar, the latter your own people. Though exiled under pain of death from your homeland, the Kingdom of the Three Islands, you have inherited your people's rich naval traditions: the Adventurer carries four cannons and all of your crew are armed with muskets, though these are slow to load making the sword your secondary weapon. Recently war has broken out on Magellan with the Elixi and Navar on one side and you on the other with your allies, the Lapau.\n\n\nYour biggest problem on long voyages is that your ship can only carry enough Supplies for 30 days which will make finding and obtaining fresh sources of Supplies your top priority. If you ever run out of Supplies (your Supply number falls to 0) then you and your Crew will starve to death and die. You will almost certainly lose Crew members during your voyage and you must be careful that your Crew number never falls to 0 either: that will mean that you and all your Crew are dead.\n\n\nFrequently there is a time element involved during your voyages and you will want to complete them in the smallest number of Days possible. Successfully completing a Voyage ahead of your Competitors will result in a Score Point which will show if you leave a Comment after the game that you have completed this story with a very high degree of skill.
