Curiously enough, you do not turn into dust. So he pulls apart your body just to make sure that you're dead. This takes long enough for the cops to arrive and catch the vampire hunter hacking you up into little pieces. They arrest him, but all the while he's screaming, \"No! It's a vampire! Let go of me!

I shall give you quick and painless death.\"\n\nHe drives a stake into your heart with all the force he can muster. To his surprise, however, instead of turning to dust like a vampire should, your body dissolves into glowing powder. Your immortality ended, and your consciousness gone forever, the vampire hunter still approaches the remnants of your body with caution. He feels the powder between his fingers, and then sniffs it. It smells like nostalgia and dreams. He tastes it, and it heals the canker sore he's had on his lip for the past month near instantaneously.\n\n\n\"Remarkable,\" he manages to utter, completely in awe. He quickly gathers up the glowing powder and fills a sack with it. He leaves your bedroom through the window he came in, and returns home. A week later he quits the vampire hunting business to travel the world, healing people of their ailments for free with the mystery powder.\n\n\nCenturies later, they still tell the tale of the healing powder that cured a million people before finally being depleted.

Turning back around and facing you, he places the cups on the stand, one in front of him, and one closer to you.\n\n\n\"I have two cups of wine here.

I was wrong, and now I will pay for that.\" He gives one last weak smile before slumping over dead.\n\nYou examine his body. That looks like some expensive equipment he's got there. And he won't be needing it anymore. You take all his stuff, including his clothing, and dress like him. You look at yourself in the mirror. Damn, you look cool! And you feel like you could take on the world right now! You dig through the pockets on the clothing and find notes on vampires and several maps.\n\n\nHmm.

No, my friend, you didn't.\"\n\n\n\"Then the poison was in my glass?\"\n\n\n\"Actually, the poison was in both our glasses.

The only way to truly make sure you would die was to poison both glasses, thus sacrificing myself in the process.\" Taking a look at him, he appears to be feeling just as queasy as you do. Your vision blurs. He smiles weakly and squints at you. \"This is the end, brother. Tonight we parish together.

Your skin crawls over rearranging muscle. Your organs move into new positions. Thick, black fur sprouts out of your skin.
