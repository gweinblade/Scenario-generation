The Wildlands are several days away from the central province covered by your feudal lord, and you have learned in this time not to put faith in the protection offered by others.  This unusual distance fostered an independent spirit in which the nobility of the Wildlands held mostly to their own laws and customs despite legally being the property of the local feudal lord, Lord Brajenak.\n\n\nOne day, your strength was not enough.\n\n\nYou awoke one morning to a large army that bore neither markings nor devices at the edge of your lands, and you ordered the men while giving the order to evacuate for all who could not fight.  In the craggy hills behind the nameless army you saw houses burn and farmland scattered with something... likely salt, so as to destroy your fields.  Such raids were common to the Wildlands, but never in this number and never this well-equipped.\n\n\nWith their long experience in these lands, most of your people escaped as the armies clashed around you.  You lifted your weapon to charge forward into the throes of war and take back your homeland... and can remember no more.  You awoke to see your people scattered and your lands either ablaze or a smoldering ruin.  Without your direction, the Wildlands have finally fallen to their invaders.\n\n\nOvercoming the seriousness of your wounds, starvation, and the harsh Wildlands, you made your way to Lord Brajenak's estate in the central province of Sethir and beseeched him for action on your behalf.  Impressed by your resolve and strength, he agreed and asked only that you continue to serve him to the best of your abilities until you were more fully reestablished.  You had little choice and accepted his invitation, and after a large meal and treatment for your wounds you were quickly ushered into your new home: A secluded training area several days from the Sethir Province where you learned the ways of ninja and became strong once again.", "action_results": [{"action": "Now for the rules", "result": "As a Ninja, your goal is to operate in the shadows unbeknownst to your enemies.

Though the physical training was grueling, your previous life amongst the Wildland soldiers and barracks had well-prepared you for combat. After all, you think grimly, what man can lead those he can't help?\n\n\nWell, normal combat.  Assassinations, poisons, and sneak attacks were lessons you struggled with as they clashed with your vaunted sense of honor.  While you are still loathe to use such tactics, your unprecedented skill in a direct assault rose to new heights with your understanding of the way of Ninja.\n\n\nIn those years you proved your battle prowess to be unmatched and were even assigned as a squad combat expert, a \"Heavy\", for this mission. Getting assigned to a squad means The Grounds and its leader, the Chieftain, believe you are ready to serve under a squad as a Ninja. Yet you have learned that the ways of Ninja are less about assault than stealth, and you pray your own legendary visibility won't impact your first assignment.\n\n\nWith that dismal thought you go over your assignment once more.  Lord Taraco is the feudal lord to the east of Lord Brajenak, an impetuous and war-mongering lord who has recently grown uncharacteristically silent on all fronts.  In anticipation of a coming war, the Chieftain left your squad with simple instructions: Determine the movements of Lord Taraco's army and gather any intelligence possible.  \n\n\nYou travel to an inn on the outskirts of Lord Brajenak's lands near the meeting point and sleep peacefully in preparation for the sleepless nights ahead.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to Section 2", "result": "You leave early the next morning for the meeting point, a clearing on the edge of a forest that separates Lord Brajenak and Lord Taraco's holdings.  Although the sun won't rise for another few hours, the air is thick with water and your clothes are soaked in sweat as you trudge towards your squad.  You run over the hilt of your weapons and your entrapment gear and determine that everything is in order as you reach your destination.  \n\n\nWhen you arrive you're slightly taken aback.  Ninja squads typically run in sets of five, but you can only discern two people waiting.  But your concern quickly vanishes, as your time at The Grounds has taught you much about the ways of Ninja.  A wind rustles around the clearing and the remaining two squad members reveal themselves.\n\n\n\"Cassie, take frontal Point and emphasize reconaissance for ambushes.  Do not engage regardless of opportunity and keep Ferian appraised of any intelligence.\"\n\n\n\"Understood,\" replied a diminuitive girl named Cassie.  Try as you might, you can rarely even find Cassie, let alone talk to her.  Still, perhaps it's for the best that the member of your squad that goes the furthest into enemy territory is as difficult to notice as her.  Though she spent years at The Grounds with you and is idly twirling a knife between her fingers, it's difficult for you to imagine her as a Ninja and assassin.\n\n\n\"Ferian, scrub left and take the usual precautions.  Tighten that sloppy perimeter and set wards in blind spots along the clearing. Keep a channel between Point and myself.\"\n\n\n\"Sure sure,\" comes Ferian's dismissive reply, his eyes glinting as his mouth upturned in a smile.  The Chieftain's overview for your squad showed Ferian to be a veteran Rear of several successful missions, charged with relaying critical information back to the Chieftain in the event of catastrophe.  Peculiarly, he was reassigned for this mission as a Secondary Point, charged now with running space control for the squad and relaying information from Point.

While Ninja squads are built on the discipline to follow orders, Rears are able to move independently so long as they return with information... even if this means ignoring existing orders or abandoning the squad to death.

We still have two days until we reach the perimeter holdings of Lord Taraco.\"\n\n\nAs you hear your orders you turn to regard Miriam, the Leader for your squad that holds your collective fates in her hands.  Your entire role as the squad's Heavy is to protect her and buy time for her and Briggs to make their moves.
