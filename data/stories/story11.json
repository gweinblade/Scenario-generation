Esme Hale is a lithe young lady with red hair, a friendly personality and an almost permanent smile. \u201cHello there Cleo, how are things?\u201d she asks cheerfully as you come aboard. After exchanging greetings she gives you an account of her voyage so far.\n\n\n\u201cAfter leaving The Three Islands we were attacked by that villain Edward Low on the Revenge who killed three of my boys. We stopped briefly at a cabin built on some corral but then I made the mistake of landing on an island of quicksand. I lost five more of my men there and I laid out grave markers for them. It was my fault, it was entirely my fault. I would not have come on this voyage if I\u2019d have known so many would die because of it.\u201d\n\n\nHale looks thoughtfully into the distance and something like a tear glitters in one eye. Cuffing it away swiftly she manages a smile and continues.\n\n\n\u201cWe then sailed past a barren rocky island and arrived here this morning. My boys have been ashore already and tell me this island is governed by penguins and as the penguins do not appear to be armed with muskets we anticipate a good hunt tomorrow for food. You are welcome to join us if you like Cleo but don\u2019t forget the time factor. As we arrived here we saw Princess Anne-Marie\u2019s Vixen and Captain Dancer\u2019s Pride sailing together in a northwest direction.\u201d\n\n\nYou mull over Esme's offer.\n\n\n \n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Spend a day hunting with Hale and her crew", "result": "Hale is glad that you\u2019ll be joining her crew and the next day you all go ashore to hunt penguins.
