Secluded away from the outer world, secret, safe in a mountain and reachable only through long, dark tunnels. It\u2019s been your home your whole life, and you love it dearly.\n\n\nDespite being at a marriable age, you live with your mother and father and help them manage their modest housestead. Today you harvest moss by scraping it away from the cave wall. Magic balls of light help you see.\n\n\nYou manage to get a decent amount into your bucket. Enough to eat well tonight. The moss will grow back over the next few days.\n\n\nYou bring it back to your house, which is essentially a sturdy tent. There isn\u2019t a single flat surface in the caves. Everywhere you go, you must be careful of your step. In many places, you must use your hands and knees to crawl and climb.\n\n\nYour mother, Rosimary, is weaving. \u201cThanks, Mary,\u201d she says as you lay out what you gathered. \u201cWe need water now.\u201d\n\n\nSure enough, the water tub is nearly empty.

Big tents and clay houses form bustling tiers, and there\u2019s even a few green plants. High on the far side, there\u2019s a shining white building. The Temple. You feel awe when you see it, as you always do. It glints beautifully.\n\n\nA stream of water flows from high above. It forms a pool at the lowest point, and in the middle of that pool is a powerful whirlpool which, as far as anyone knows, spirals down forever.\n\n\nYou make your way there and fill your bucket. The water's crystal clear and icy cold.\n\n\n\u201cDid you hear \u2018bout the magician?\u201d says a voice behind you.\n\n\nYou turn around and see your cousin, Westerly.

And not the one from the Temple.\u201d\n\n\nOnly the Temple priests are allowed to practice magic here. Anyone else who does is evil. Terribly evil. That's what you've been raised to believe. You stand up fully. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. The priests would never allow it.\u201d\n\n\nHe shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s what the talkers are talking.\u201d\n\n\nYou refuse to believe it.

No knowledge?\u201d It\u2019s a serious question.\n\n\nYou nod. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, then this is the curse, I do believe. I do believe. Sap has always been your sister, and now you have no memory of her!\u201d\n\n\nYou stare at the girl. A sister? But you\u2019ve always been a single child. How can this be so?

There\u2019s a pause.\n\n\nNovitiate Murl, who has been nearby the whole time, speaks up. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say Sap was powerful, Mother? Perhaps he intended to sap her power away.

It hits against the rock hard, causing it to shatter and making an exploding noise.\n\n\nWithout hesitation, she starts to run forward. How can she even see where she\u2019s going? You follow hesitantly. As you come closer, you see a rat there. She stomps on it hard, again and again.\n\n\nOkay, random. The rat keeps moving, refusing to die.
