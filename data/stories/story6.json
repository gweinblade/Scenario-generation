While many of the surrounding countries frequently go to war with each other, Vinia has been neutral in all conflicts for centuries. Because of this, many refugees and other citizens flee to Vinia to find peace, creating a rich, diverse, and multicultural population. Vinia's captial city of Dialla is also home to the largest, most prestigious college in all of Belacia. \n\n\nBecause of Vinia's prosperity, some other kingdoms have grown envious and show distaste towards Vinia and its people. The most notable of these enemies is the Kingdom of Niravia, Vinia's less affluent neighbor. However, while the relationship between these two countries has always been tense, it has always been been peaceful.\n\n\nYou are Prince Alexander of Vinia, the only child of King Arien and Queen Lianne. \n\n\nYou have grown up in the royal palace in Dialla, Vinia's seaside capital. Your parents believed it important for you to be humble, so they allowed you to go into the city and play with the common children. As a young boy, you often found yourself on the beach with the other children, calling out to the fishermen in the distance and trying to find seashells. As you got older, you and your friends often spent time in the marketplace helping merchants and listening to members of the Royal Guard tell extravagant stories. Occasionally, you would help the students at the college collect materials for their studies. You had a happy childhood.\n\n\nWhen you were of age, your parents asked you what you wanted to be as an adult. You chose to be a soldier. As a soldier, you will join the Royal Guard, where you will be trained in the art of physical combat. You will become strong of body and mind, and those traits coupled with your unmatched sword skills will make you a difficult foe to defeat.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Story Begins", "result": "You are in your bedchamber, fast asleep.

You quietly get out of bed and get into a fighting stance, mentally preparing for what may come at you.\n\n\nThe door handle turns completely, accentuated with a small click. Then, the door is pushed open. It gives way to nothing but a pitch black hallway.\n\n\nYou begin to step cautiously toward the door, sword at the ready, when a small dart flies from the darkness and lands in your arm. Another follows, hitting you in the neck. You cry out as your body begins to become numb and your vision blurs. The last thing you remember is falling to the floor. ", "action_results": [{"action": "Wake up", "result": "When you come to, you find yourself in the back of what appears to be a wooden cart with a large piece of cloth placed over top of you. You can hear the sound of the wooden wheels moving through the grass and dirt, the clop of a horse's hooves, and the melodious sounds of a forest. You try to move but find that your hands and feet are tied tightly with rope. There's a piece of cloth shoved in your mouth and another tied around your head (so as to prevent you from spitting out the piece in your mouth).\n\n\nAt first you can't recall why exactly you're in the back of a wooden cart, bound and gagged, but then it all comes rushing back to you; waking up in the middle of the night, being attacked by an unknown intruder. \n\n\nYour mind is reeling, and you can't think of a reason why you would have been attacked in the first place. You don't think you've ever made any enemies, and your kingdom has never been hostile towards another kingdom. You think that maybe someone wanted ransom money, and thought kidnapping you would be the way to get it. That wouldn't be too far fetched. Vinia is arguably the most affluent country in Belacia, after all.\n\n\nJust when you think you're beginning to make sense of what's happened to you, you hear the unmistakable sound of an arrow being shot and a shout from where you presume the driver of the cart would be. There is the thud of a large object falling on the ground, and then the cart suddenly lifts on one side as the wheels of the cart run over the object--presumably the body of your kidnapper.\n\n\n\"Clean work, boys, now let's get that cart!\" you hear a gruff, booming voice yell somewhere not far from you. Was your cart being hijacked?\n\n\nYou hear multiple voices saying calming things to the horse pulling the cart and it slowly comes to a halt. The same voice as before, closer now, says, \"Alright, let's see what this poor sod had with him.\"\n\n\nYour cart had definitely just been hijacked.\n\n\nThe cloth that is covering you is abruptly pulled off of your body, and you wince at your eyes' sudden reintroduction to sunlight. When your eyes adjust, you see a group of five or so men standing over you. They all look thuggish and dirty. They look down at you in confusion.\n\n\n\"What's this?\" the same voice as before, most likely the leader of the group, says. The man is the largest and dirtiest of all present. \"Who are you?\" he asks you. \n\n\nYou...", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to talk", "result": "You attempt to say something, but the cloth in your mouth prevents you from making any intelligible sounds. \n\n\n\"Oh, right,\" the leader says, as if he's just noticing the fact that you're gagged and can't answer his question. He grabs the cloth covering your mouth, allowing you to spit out the cloth in your mouth. Your mouth is dry, your throat sore from thirst. \"Now then, who are you?\" he asks.\n\n\n \n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Lie", "result": "\"My name is Alexander, I'm a knight in training from Vinia,\" you tell them. You don't think it would be smart to tell them who you really are. Just in case.\n\n\n\"Well, Alexander,\" the leader says, \"how'd you find yourself in the back of some guy's cart? Got a debt you forgot to pay?\"\n\n\n\"No, I have no idea what's going on. He just attacked me!\" You tell them. Some of the men nod in understanding. \n\n\nThe leader seems to feel sorry for you. \"Well, why don't you come with us back to ou camp? We can get you fed and watered.\"\n\n\nYou...", "action_results": [{"action": "Go with them", "result": "\"I think I'll take you up on that offer,\" you tell the leader. \"By the way, what's your name?\"\n\n\n\"The name's Jarven,\" he tells you, puffing up his chest in an attempt to look more grand. \n\n\n\"No title?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Nope, just Jarven,\" he confirms. \"My boys and I roam this forest and take what we need to survive.\"\n\n\nWhen Jarven and \"his boys\" begin to walk back into the forest, you follow. You figure it isn't such a bad idea to get some food and water, and then you can try to figure out where you are and why you're there.\n\n\nThe camp doesn't end up being that far of a walk, which you're thankful for. It's situated in a decently sized clearing, with about ten tents surrounding the perimeter--one of which looks larger and nicer than all the others--and has a large bonfire in the middle. There are about ten other men scattered around the camp when you arrive, a few of them playing a card game and the others polishing some swords. It's not the standards that you're used to, but it'll do. \n\n\n\"Everybody,\" Jarven announces,\"this\"--he motions to you--\"is Alexander. He'll be joining us for a little bit. Play nice.\" The men acknowledge their leader's words with a few noncommittal grunt and nods, but for the most part they ignore your presence. Jarven claps you on the shoulder and says, \"Now, let's get you some food and drink, boy.\"\n\n\nJarven leads you to the largest tent, which, although nicer than the others, is still pretty shabby. The inside has a large carpet covering the ground, a cot on the far left side, a small table next to the bed, and a circular dining table to the right. There's a large chest at the end of the bed. \"Go on, have a seat,\" Jarven tells you, waving in the direction of the table. You do as he says. \"I'll be right back.\"\n\n\nYou are then left alone in Jarven's tent. \n\n\nYou...", "action_results": [{"action": "Look around", "result": "With Jarven gone, you figure it'd be a good time to snoop around a little and get up from the table. \n\n\nYou walk towards the chest at the end of the cot and try to open it, but it's locked. Upon further examination, you see a few things on the bedside table. There's a rolled up piece of paper, a few gold coins, a candle, and an empty cup. \n\n\nYou're about to inspect these things further when you hear someone approaching the tent, so you quickly return to your seat at the table.\n\n\nWhen Jarven returns, he does so with a loud, \"Food's ready!\" and places a bowl of stew and a cup of something that might be water in front of you. It smells good, so you dig in right away. \n\n\n\"So, Alexander,\" Jarven says, taking a seat across from you, \"you really from Vinia?\"\n\n\nYou finish chewing your food before answering. \"Yes,\" you tell him, \"I live in Dialla.\"\n\n\n\"Hm. Then why are you here?\" He asks.\n\n\n\"I told you before, the person driving the cart just kidnapped me one night. I don't even know where I am.\"\n\n\nJarven laughs a big, bellowing belly laugh. \"Well you're not in Vinia, I can tell you that much.\"\n\n\nYou sigh, getting somewhat annoyed at the fact you're not getting a straight answer. \"So then where am I?\"\n\n\n\"You're in Niravia.\"\n\n\nYou're taken aback. \"Niravia?\" you ask. You feel slightly sick; Niravia is known for it depravity and poverty, and many of the knights back in Dialla have told you of the things they've experience in the country.\n\n\n\"The one and only.\" Jarven chuckles when he sees the expression on your face. \"Aw, come on, boy, it's not that bad. I'm sure it's not as nice as Vinia, but--\"\n\n\n\"How far are we from the border?\" you cut him off. \n\n\nHe has to think for a moment, but he finally tells you, \"Twenty kilometers, about.\"\n\n\nYou sigh in relief. That's not far enough too far. And Vinia is relatively small country, stretching maybe one hundred kilometers across. It's not an impossible distance to travel on foot, should you choose to do so. \n\n\n\"I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you, boy,\" Jarven says. \"The journey to the border isn't an easy one. You'd probably die.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay with the bandits", "result": "\"I think you may be right,\" you tell Jarven. He looks pleased at your answer. \"I think I'll stay here for a little while, build up my strength some more before I try to travel home.\"\n\n\nThose were your plans, but you never make it back to Dialla. After about a month of living with the bandits, the group is attacked by some military scouts. In the chaos, you manage to escape death by the sword, but you run into a pack of feral wolves not far from the fighting. This is where you meet your end. ", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Travel to the border", "result": "\"That's a risk I'm going to have to take,\" you tell Jarven. He sighs. \n\n\n\"I guess I should have expected that, there's no reason for you to stay here with us. Have to say I was hoping you would, though, you look like you're a good fighter. Probably could've used you.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you for everything you've done for me,\" you say as you finish up your stew. \"I have no clue what would have happened if you and your men hadn't killed the person driving that cart I was in.\"\n\n\n\"You'd probably be dead!\" He laughs. You don't really know why he finds the prospect of your death so funny. Jarven then gets up and walks over to the chest at the end of his cot. \"You haven't caused any trouble, so I'll give you some things to take with you. Hopefully they'll help.\" He then pulls a key out of his pocket and unlocks the chest. You get up and walk over, standing next to him. \n\n\n\"Let's see...\" he says to himself. \"You'll need...a sword...and a canteen...and a map...and some money...and a knapsack...that should be enough.\" As he says each word, he pulls the corresponding item out of the chest. You're shocked by the man's generosity, but you don't question it. He stands up, holding the canteen, and turns to walk out of the tent. \"I'll go grab you some food and fill this up with some water.\"\n\n\nYou pick up the things Jarven had laid out for you and begin packing your knapsack. He returns with what he promised and gives the food and canteen to you. \n\n\n\"All set?\" he asks as you secure the sword to your belt. It's not as nice as the ones you have in Dialla, but it'll work if you need to defend yourself. You nod at him and he leads you out of the tent. He pulls a crumpled up piece of paper from his pocket and unfolds it, showing that it's a map. \n\n\n\"The map you have is an exact replica of this one,\" he tells you. \"This,\" he says as he points at a small triangular marking about a third of the way from the left edge of the page, \"is this camp. You need to go west to reach Vinia's border. Depending on how you go, you might hit Sirra\"--he points at a house marking in between the camp and the edge of the page--\"where you can stay at the inn. It's kinda run down, but it's better than spending the night in the woods.\"\n\n\n\"And how exactly do I reach Sirra?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"There's a path that goes straight to the border--I'll bring you there, don't worry--but it forks a little while down. If you go on the more northern route then you'll reach Sirra. The other one's a little faster, but there's no guarantee you'll find someplace to sleep. There're some houses along that way, though. Maybe someone will be feelin' hospitable.\"\n\n\nIt's a lot to take in, and you hope you'll remember all the information.\n\n\n\"Now then, let's get you to the road,\" Jarven says jovially, clapping you on the shoulder. He then takes you out of the camp, leading you back the way you had walked earlier. You emerge on a road, the cobblestones worn down by years of use. It was mostly just grass, really, but it was still a clear path that you could easily follow, and for that you were thankful. Jarven grabs your shoulders and turns you so you're facing one way on the path. \n\n\n\"West,\" he says, and gives you a small push. You take the hint and begin walking. As you leave him behind, you hear Jarven shout, \"Don't die out there, kid!\" You don't intend on doing so, but at least it makes you laugh. You wave at him without turning around, your mind set on one thing: getting back to Vinia. \n\n\n \n\nYou've only been walking for a couple of hours when the sun starts to set. You're starting to get hungry again and there's a dull ache in your feet; the rough terrain was doing you no favors.\n\n\nBut you push forward for another fifteen minutes or so, at which point you can see the fork in the road Jarven had told you about. As you approach, you see what looks to be a sign indicating what lies in each direction, but as you get closer you see that the paint is too faded to make out. \n\n\nYou take a swig of water from your canteen and think. The sun is setting quickly, as it always does this time of year, and the forest is quickly coming alive with foreign noises. You need to find someplace to stay for the night--the sooner the better.\n\n\nDo you go to the left or right?

You can't see as many stars in Dialla, what with all of the lights in the city. As beautiful as the sight is, you know you'll enjoy it more when you're safe.\n\n\nHowever, this does not happen. Having taken the left path, you have unintentionally avoided the town of Sirra, and are now stranded in the forest overnight. You grow uneasy as you push forward, the strange sounds of the forest growing louder and louder with every step you take.\n\n\nYou think you're saved when you spot a small house along the road, and you eagerly knock on the door. An older woman opens it, and looks quite concerned by your situation, so she invites you in. She gives you a hot meal and drink, which you happily accept, but it will be your last meal. Unbeknownst to you, the woman was only interested in the supplied you carried and so put poison in your drink. The last thing you see before your vision fades is the fresh, hot meal before you. \n\n\nThis is where you meet your end.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Right", "result": "You decide to take the path to the right. \n\n\nWithin half an hour, the forest is completely dark.

As beautiful as the sight is, you know you'll enjoy it more when you're safe.\n\n\nYour perseverance pays off, because a few minutes later you can see the lights of a town in the distance. You begin running down the path, eager to reach a place where you can relax a little. \n\n\nThe town--Sirra, you presume--isn't large, but it's big enough to have a few shops and an inn. There are a decent amount of people still walking the streets, and you think that Sirra must get a lot of people passing through it since it's so close to the border. \n\n\nYou find the inn easily enough--it's by far the largest building in the town, and most of the people on the streets are going to or coming from it. \n\n\nYou walk in and are met with an environment far different than that found in the inns in Dialla. The room is dark and smoky with a bard at the end playing a low tune. The room is filled with people, but the conversation isn't loud and boisterous, it's almost like a quiet hum. There's a bar to the right that spans the entire side of the building, and stairs directly to your left, most likely leading to the rooms upstairs. \n\n\nYou walk over to the bar and sit down at one of the stools. After a moment one of the workers--a stout, middle aged man with a large beard--comes over to you. \n\n\n\"What'd you like?\" he asks. He's cleaning some glasses and doesn't seem particularly interested in you. You think he might be the barkeep. \n\n\n\"A meal and a room, please,\" you tell him. He laughs.\n\n\n\"Not from around here?\" \n\n\n\"Excuse me?\" You don't think you did anything that would shout to the world that you're not from the area, but this stranger obviously thinks otherwise.\n\n\n\"You're too polite to be from Sirra,\" he chuckles. \"But never mind that--tonight there's either rabbit stew or meat pie. What do you want?\"\n\n\nYou had stew earlier, so you go with the meat pie.

He counts it, looking satisfied. \"You get room twenty-four. Second floor on the left.\" With that he leaves and goes into the kitchen. You put your remaining money back in your pocket and make for the stairs. Before you can reach them, however, a large, brutish man steps in front of you and looks down at you menacingly. You're not exactly a small person, and yet this man towers over you. \n\n\n\"Can I help you?\" you ask. You really just want to get to your room and go to sleep, not be bothered by some giant.\n\n\n\"I don't like your face,\" he grunts.

The men comply, dragging the struggling brute out of the inn. The barkeep turns to you and asks, \"Are you alright?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" you tell him, but the entire side of your face is throbbing. You know you'll be fine, though; you've had worse injuries than a bruised jaw before. \n\n\n\"Head on up to your room, I'll have one of the staff bring up some water and a washcloth so you can clean those cuts.\"\n\n\nYou nod and head up the stairs, the old wood creaking with every step you take. You go up to the second floor and take the second door on the left, just like the barkeep had told you. The room is small, with a bed and a side table, a small dresser in the corner, and a mirror hung on the wall above that dresser. A dim light comes from the candle on the bedside table. You place your bag on the bed and then look at yourself in the mirror. The side of your face is already starting to swell, and there are cuts on your temple and cheek from the plate you fell on. Your nose is bleeding, but you don't think it's broken. \n\n\nA knock on the door pulls you away from the mirror. You open it and a man is standing there, a large bowl of steaming water in his hands and a washcloth hung over his arm. He's probably around your age, with close-cut dark hair and equally dark eyes. He's smiling, but it doesn't quite look genuine. \n\n\n\"For you,\" he says, extending the bowl out to you. \n\n\n\"Thank you,\" you respond, taking the bowl from him. You walk it over to the dresser and put it down. When you turn around, you see he's standing right behind you, although you never heard him enter. He holds out the cloth to you. He's got the same empty smile as before, and up close you notice how hollow his eyes look as well. You begin to feel uneasy and want him to leave.

Some of the staff are cleaning off tables and preparing for the day, and the barkeep is behind the bar, cleaning dishes.\n\n\nYou go up to the bar and take a seat. \"What's for breakfast?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Eggs and bread,\" he replies. \n\n\n\"I'll have that, then.\" The barkeep walks back to the kitchen and emerges a few minutes later with your food.

Sirra looks much different in the daylight. There are mothers and children running around the streets, some merchants set up along the sidewalk trying to sell their wares. People walk to their work, chatting with each other jovially. The sun, although just having risen, illuminates the streets. Despite the fact the town looks nothing like Dialla, it reminds you of your beloved city. The energy of the town lifts your spirits and encourages you to move toward the edge of the town.\n\n\nAs the buildings get more and more spaced out and the people become more sparse you see a man leaning against a cart with two bulls hitched to it. When you get closer, the man calls out, \"Are you the kid I'm supposed to be drivin'?\"\n\n\n\"Yessir,\" you tell him. The man is older, with a weathered look about him.\n\n\n\"Alright, hop in front,\" he tells you, climbing onto the seat on the front of the cart. He grabs the reigns in his hands and waits until you're settled next to him to leave. The bulls aren't fast creatures, but you know they're faster than you. Plus, you won't get tired from walking. \n\n\n\"I'm only following the main road for so long,\" the farmer tells you. While the path leading to Sirra had been shrouded in trees, the path was now winding through farmlands, flat and spreading for as far as the eye could see. You occasionally spot workers in some of the fields. \"I'm going north, to Terrid--it's a small town on the way to the capital--so you're gonna have to walk the little bit back to the border. It's not too far, though. You can make it before sunset.\"\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\nThe farmer looks at you. \"So tell me about yourself, boy. Got any reason for going to Vinia? Or maybe just visitin'?\"\n\n\n\"I live in Dialla,\" you tell him. \"I'm training to be a soldier. Some...unfortunate circumstances lead me to Niravia.\"\n\n\nThe farmer laughed. \"I can tell ya don't wanna talk about it, it's alright, boy. But a soldier? That's excitin'!\"\n\n\n\"It is,\" you give a small laugh yourself, \"we're trained in defending ourselves and the people, and we get to patrol the city. I've met many colorful characters.\"\n\n\n\"I've always wanted to go to Dialla,\" the farmer confesses. \"My wife went when she was little, once--said it was amazing. I've never even seen the sea.\"\n\n\n\"Doesn't Niravia touch the sea? In the south?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, but everyone says the beach there is rocky and ugly, nothin' compared to Dialla, I'm sure.\"\n\n\n\"Not many places can compare to Dialla, I'm afraid,\" you say. \"You should visit sometime, we love having guests in the city.\"\n\n\nThe farmer smiled. \"Maybe in the winter, when I don't have to care for the farm. I'd have to find someone to watch the animals, though. I won't ask my neighbor, that's for sure. He's a prick.\"\n\n\nYou laugh. \"I'm sure you'll be able to find someone.\"\n\n\nThe rest of your ride with the farmer continues in the same fashion, simply talking about whatever crossed your minds. When you reach the small fork in the path, the farmer brings the cart to a stop. \n\n\n\"Well, this is where we part ways,\" he says. \"Go ahead and take a few vegetables for your travels. Wouldn't want ya to starve, would we?\" he chuckles. \n\n\n\"I couldn't--\"\n\n\n\"Go ahead, boy. You can repay me when I come to Dialla. What's your name? I'll ask for ya at the guards' barracks.\"\n\n\n\"Just ask for Alexander,\" you tell him, going around to the back of the cart where the farmer's wares are. All of the fruits and vegetables look delicious, but you don't want to take too much, so you just grab a nice green apple and a ripe tomato. \n\n\n\"Alright, Alexander, you'll be seein' me in the future!\" the farmer yells as he takes off down the north road. You wave before continuing on the main road. The sun is high in the sky, so you figure it must be around noon.\n\n\nYou walk down the seemingly endless path, the sun beating down on you with every step you take. Not long into the journey you become hungry and stop for some food, sitting on the side of the path as you munch contently on the food you received from the farmer. When you've finished, you stand up and continue on your way. \n\n\nYou feel like you've been walking for years--your feet ache and your mind is weary with doubt--before you see your goal: the border. The border of Vinia is marked very clearly by a ten meter high stone wall. All the fatigue you had suddenly left your body and you began running for the gate at the end of the road, giddy as a child running to play. \n\n\nWhen you reach the large gates, the three guards stationed there look concerned at your happiness.\n\n\n\"Can we help you?\" one of them asks. He's the shortest of the three. \n\n\n\"Yes,\" you say, catching your breath, \"I would like to pass through to Vinia, please.\" Upon hearing you speak, the guards seem to lighten up a little. \n\n\n\"You're from Dialla, aren't you?\" one of them--the youngest--asks. You smile and nod, knowing they must have picked up on the slight accent all native Diallans have. You're shocked by how happy you are to be around your own countrymen again. \n\n\n\"Open the gate!\" the last guard--a woman--shouts, and a moment later the large gate leading into Vinia is lifted, granting you access back to your beloved land. \n\n\n\"Lucky for you, there's a group of guards heading back to Dialla tonight. I'm sure they'd be happy to take you along,\" the short one tells you, pointing you towards the barracks located along the stone wall. There's a large carriage next to it, the horses not yet hitched. You sigh in relief. \n\n\n\"Thank you,\" you tell the guards. \n\n\nThe guards lead you to the barracks, where you are given a fresh meal and new clothes before being loaded on the carriage back to Dialla.

It's a bit of a tight squeeze, but you manage to close the door.\n\n\nYou hear the small click of the door handle being turned completely followed by the slow creak of the door being opened. Now knowing that something isn't right, you cover your mouth with your hand in an attempt to quiet your breathing and stay as still as possible. \n\n\nEverything is silent for a few moment when the wardrobe door is suddenly flung open.

You begin to think that you should have hidden or grabbed your weapon, just in case.\n\n\nThat's when a dart flies from the darkness, landing directly in your neck.
