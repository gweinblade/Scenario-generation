It was one of those one rare and precious days of spring with neither rain nor snow, insect pests nor incessant clamor of a migratory flock, biting frost nor unbearable heat. \n\n\nNo, it was none of these things.  It was a thing of beauty and a sight to behold, and as usual, Sir Osis of the Liver hated it anyway.  When most laborers had already been working for several hours, Sir Osis was just rolling out of his bed. \n\n\nAs he spent the next hour eating breakfast and nursing his head in silence, he reflected on what he could do that day.  He could go around the village and watch for criminals, old ladies whose cats insisted upon climbing trees they had no intention of descending, and such, or he could stay home and train or take care of some business\u2026or perhaps lie in bed some more.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to the Village", "result": "If Sir Osis got into the habit of never leaving his quarters, he might as well have been any worthless beggar.  Sir Osis was a knight, and a knight had a job to do. \n\n\nHe made himself presentable, put on his armor, and told the stable-boy to get his horse ready.  Alphonse had been a gift from Queen Justinia years ago and was the finest horse Sir Osis had ever had the pleasure of riding, although, being only ten hands, Alphonse was only a horse in the sense that he was some sort of equine.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of breathing in the fragrance of horse and kicking dandelions to make the seeds fly, the stable-boy came out leading a white pony which had a perpetual expression of stink-eye.  Sir Osis thanked him before mounting the pony.\n\n\n\u201cCome along, Alphonse!  There is much work to be done!\u201d he said with a kick to Alphonse\u2019s sides.  Alphonse began to lumber into the courtyard with all the speed of a drunken butterfly.  The extra speed must have been due to Sir Osis\u2019s naturally motivating voice. \n\n\nEventually he came out of the gate and into the lower castle where the village was.  Here was the blacksmith, the weaver, the tailor, the church, and any nice thing you would expect from a respectable village except for a brothel.  As his lord did not allow that within his walls, the brothel was set up immediately in front of and to the left of the outermost gate. \n\n\nAs he rode through the village, when he was not attempting to cut an imposing figure, he was noticing something strange.  He saw no pickpocketing, witnessed no bar fights, and met no old ladies needing help with their cats.  Heck, ol\u2019 Jeremiah wasn\u2019t even disturbing the peace with senile shouting today. \n\n\nYet, Sir Osis had gone out today determined to protect the village, defend the honor of women, and all those knightly things, and that he would do.  He decided to go to one of the merchant stalls and ask if there was trouble of any sort.  Merchants had a tendency to learn about these things at a speed rivalled only by old women, after all. \n\n\nSir Osis saw a merchant known as Andrew selling a carpet to the butcher\u2019s wife and approached him, \u201cI trust you\u2019ve been having a good morning, Andrew.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait your\u2014oh.  It\u2019s you, sir,\u201d Andrew said, stiffening.\n\n\n\u201cYes, I have decided to come out and see if there was any trouble brewing that I could put a stop to this fine morn.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, sir, but we would do well to keep it that way.\u201d\n\n\nSir Osis dismounted and leaned on the stall.  \u201cAre you certain of this?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am, and could you\u2014Sarah!  I\u2019ll give you a special price for your\u2014well, she\u2019s gone now\u2026.\u201d Andrew muttered something unintelligible, took a deep breath, and turned to look Sir Osis directly in the eye.  \u201cI have just recalled that the miller was experiencing some trouble with rats.  Mayhap you could find it within your kind and merciful self to rid him of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAndrew, rats are an important part of the natural world.  To eliminate rats would be to starve the hawks and the snakes.  You have to learn to think of consequences before you say such things.\u201d\n\n\nAndrew looked as if he was going to say something, but he changed his mind and just nodded.  \u201cI shall try, sir.  Now, I did think of something you may be interested in.  There\u2019s a merchant caravan passing through to the next town, and I hear they also have the daughter of some lord or another with them.  Now, they are not going far, but in light of the recent increase in banditry on that road, I doubt they would object if you offered some extra protection.\u201d  He shrugged.  \u201cMaybe you could have a vacation afterwards too.  You would certainly deserve one after all the hard work you have been putting in.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmmm, you know.  That is a worthy idea!  I am indebted to you for your help today.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think of it.  You should probably make haste.  They shall not be here long.\u201d\n\n\nSir Osis mounted Alphonse and rode at a speed that would put a pregnant housefly to shame to go find the caravan master.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSir Osis found the caravan master buying some flour from the miller.  He was a short, leather-sinned man dressed in simple but well-made clothing and carried himself as one who had spent his life learning of his own inferiority. \n\n\n\u201cAre you the master of the caravan that is passing through?\u201d he asked, dismounting. \n\n\n\u201cAye, good sir.  The name\u2019s John,\u201d he answered with a polite bow.\n\n\n\u201cOsis of the Liver.  I heard you are in need of protection and have come to offer my services.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would be most grateful to you, Sir Osis.  What measure of payment be ye expecting?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll accept no payment, goodman.  It is my sworn duty to protect the innocent from such dangers as present themselves upon the road,\u201d he said with a heroic pose.  It helped that the innocent included a noble lady.  Talk about brownie points.\n\n\n\u201cWell then, can you leave at noon?\u201d\n\n\nThat gave him around an hour and a half to prepare.  That would totally work.  \u201cI shall meet thee before noon!\u201d he said, swinging his leg over the pony.  \u201cCome along, Alphonse.\u201d \n\n\nJohn the caravan master watched bewildered as Alphonse plodded along majestically.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "The Caravan", "result": "Just as he promised, Sir Osis arrived a few minutes before noon with his sword sharpened and his bladder emptied.  The caravan was on the smaller side, and, aside from the single covered carriage, lightly guarded.  Evidently the bit about precious cargo was slightly exaggerated, unless the crown jewels were hidden in the saddlebag of one of the mules.  Still, the caravan\u2019s small size probably made for an even more enticing target for bandits. \n\n\n\u201cTen minutes, everyone!\u201d the caravan master cried.  One merchant who had decided to try to sell some of his stock here began hastily packing his things.  Sir Osis decided this would be a good time to introduce himself to the lady who he had learned was Marian, daughter of Lord Feithid. \n\n\nHe rode over to the carriage and bowed while atop his horse.  Alphonse nearly fell over, but quickly recovered.  He was a good horse.  The lord\u2019s daughter was a plump girl with a very bored expression and made no acknowledgement of Sir Osis, save a slight wave of the hand. \n\n\n\u201cI trust your travels have gone well so far, Lady Feithid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh-huuuh.\u201d\n\n\nHe chose to take that as the affirmative and continued, \u201cI shall be providing you with some extra protection for the remainder of your journey, as these roads can be very treacherous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you need anything at all\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGot it.  Get you and that pony away from me.  I\u2019m trying to daydream about Scuzzi in peace.\u201d\n\n\nHe stared in shock a moment before hesitantly asking, \u201cScuzzi, milady?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Danish skald.  Gosh, old people.  He\u2019s so ruggedly handsome, yet he smells so good\u2026.How could you not have heard of him?!  Go stab some children or whatever ye uncultured brutes do!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cForgive me, milady.\u201d  Sir Osis rode away from the carriage, attempting to determine whether that conversation could be called a success or a failure.  After much contemplation, he determined it a success.\n\n\n \n\nAfter another hour, the caravan master finally got everyone ready to go, and they set off on their way.  It was unfortunate that they had not left in the morning, but the days were long in spring. \n\n\nThe smell of cool mud and the sounds of the carts and the birds were a lullaby to Sir Osis, and he had to make up a little story in his head about a robin fighting a war against a rattlesnake army to entertain himself.  He should have been a skald or a bard himself, because the story was so entertaining that he did not notice a man walking out into the middle of the road in front of them and drawing a bow.\n\n\nThe group came to a halt, and the guards drew closer to the carriage.  Sir Osis readied his hand to draw his sword and looked into the trees.  He couldn\u2019t see anybody else, but if there were, things could get very bad. \n\n\n\u201cHand over the goods, and drop your weapons, and nobody will get hurt\u201d the highwayman said. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drop them in Hell!\u201d one of the guards screamed before charging him.  His words proved prophesy when he was stopped with an arrow through his neck.  With the bandit having to draw and aim again, this was perhaps a good opportunity to take him out, or there was the option to wait for another opportunity, perhaps while he was assisting in the handing over of goods.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack him", "result": "He wasn\u2019t about to let this bastard make a fool of him.  Alphonse charged as Sir Osis drew his sword.  The bandit was caught off guard by the site of a grown man in armor bouncing around on a pony, and he did not react in time to prevent being stabbed in the stomach.  Sir Osis\u2019s triumph ended when a chorus of shouts came from the forest, and bandits came pouring out.  Bandits were a lot better at hiding than they used to be.\n\n\nSir Osis immediately went on the defensive and began to cut down men left and right.  He cut down two of them, you see\u2014one on the left, and one on the right.  Then a blow to his chest from a very large man knocked him off his horse.  He hit the ground stunned and the large man immediately knocked him unconscious.\n\n\nWhen he woke up, the surrounding were tinged with grey.  There was an intense, throbbing pain in his head and his face itched.  A lot.  He tried to get up, but he realized his arms and legs were bound and his armor was gone.   A wave of nausea came over him, and he ended up making a mess all over his shirt.  Then he remembered what had happened.  He had been hit in the head, several times, and the resulting blood had dried on him.   After a few more minutes of lying in a tired daze, he rolled onto his side to look around.  Tied to a tree were a pair of the merchants, and Lady Feithid and another girl both sat on the ground with their hands and feet tied.  Most of the bandits he could see were occupied with sorting the spoil, discussing things among themselves, or attending to various needs around the camp.  There seemed to be only one man watching the prisoners, but that did not mean there were not more in the woods. \n\n\nIf he waited for the man to not be paying attention, there was a chance he could escape.  Otherwise, he would probably be held for either ransom or slavery, and who would pay the ransom of a knight who could not even avoid being captured by bandits?  Escape was a big risk though, and he would never be free if he was dead.  Perhaps it was better to wait until a time when there would be less focus on him, or even to be sold and catch a ship home.\n\n\nHe continued to watch until someone called the man guarding the prisoners over to do something else.   He knew that it may not be his best chance, but it could also be his only one.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attempt Escape", "result": "He had to take this opportunity.  Slavery was dishonorable and would likely lead to a death both premature and inglorious.  Not to mention the horrible diet he would have.  Sir Osis leaned forward and grabbed the small knife he had concealed in his belt.  Then he cut his hands and legs free.   Then he realized there was a stinging sensation in one of his hands.  Apparently, he had cut himself by accident, and quite deeply too.  However, that was something to worry about later.  It would not be long before someone returned to check on them. \n\n\nAlphonse was tied to another tree nearby.  Now, what kind of a knight would leave his trusty steed behind?  Not Sir Osis.  He untied him and tried to lead him away.  That endeavor was met with considerable resistance, but Alphonse soon gave in.   They really had to hurry now.  He turned his gaze over to the other prisoners and made a decision.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave Them", "result": "This was not the most noble decision he had made, but he wisdom should trump nobility.  Sir Osis didn\u2019t look back as he led his horse away as quietly as possible.  He had not gone far when he heard shouting from the camp. \n\n\nHe reminded himself that he had made the best choice and that this was be better than none of them being freed.  As he quickened his pace to make distance between himself and the camp, he even told himself that he would lead a rescue mission once he returned to the castle. \n\n\nThe shouting grew continuously fainter, and Sir Osis gave a prayer of thanks that they did not have hounds.  Now it was just him, alone in the forest.  Well, his horse was there too.  This wasn\u2019t right.  He was supposed to protect the caravan, and here he was abandoning them to save his own hide.\n\n\n\u201cUghhhh\u2026.\u201d\n\n\nThen there was that feeling in his head that he decided was akin to that of his brain being juiced like a lemon.  More than anything, he wanted to lie under a tree and close his eyes for a while, perhaps forever, but he knew he had to keep going.  He didn\u2019t escape to die in the forest. \n\n\nFor what seemed an eon, he lumbered through the forest.  Endless wandering.  Nothing but trees and woodpeckers.  Woodpeckers pounding at his brain.  Endlessly pounding for hours and hours.  All sounds were an indistinct drone in the presence of the woodpecker\u2019s.  Had he seen that tree before?  No matter.  They all looked the same anyway.  Just a little farther, and he would be home.  If only that cursed woodpecker would\u2026\n\n\nSir Osis fell onto the carpet of brush and weeds.  He was lost.  Nobody was going to expect him home tonight.  Thoughts of his lord\u2019s son finding his remains while on a hunt passed through his mind before he realized such thoughts were silly.  Wild animals would surely tear him apart before then.\n\n\n He gripped his head and sat up.  There was no way he could succumb to such dishonorable fate as that.  Now if he only used the setting sun as a guidance, he could find his way home.   If the sun sets in the east, and home lies northward, then I must go\u2026this way. \n\n\nCourse in mind, he hurried through the brush as quickly as he can while he still had light.  Before long, he heard a familiar sound, and it was no blasted woodpecker.  Sir Osis let go of Alphonse\u2019s bridle and stumbled towards the sound of the running water.  When he reached the source, he gave a shout in excitement.  Just across this stream and through a few trees was the castle, or was it?  After he had taken a moment to actually look around, he soon realized that this was a very different part of the creek than the one near the castle, if it was even the same one. \n\n\nThis was fine.  He could take this in stride.  At least he would have some much-needed refreshment before he continued his journey tomorrow.  Animals that he could hunt would probably come to drink too.  Of course, that included animals of all sizes and levels of aggression, and he had neither sword nor bow, but that was fine.  He was going to be just fine. \n\n\n\u201cA lovely evening, is it not, milord?\u201d a feminine voice called.\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Sir Osis turned to the source of the voice, a pale woman with what seemed to be the most striking blue eyes in the world.  She was sitting on the bank of the stream with unbound, auburn hair joining her feet in the water. \n\n\n\u201cOh, uh, good evening to you too,\u201d he stammered.  His being unaware of her presence until did not speak well of his current state of mind.  He would have to be more careful, or next time he may not get a chance to see them.\n\n\n\u201cThou seemest unwell.  Did something happen to thee?\n\n\nSir Osis walked over to his horse and grabbed the bridle again.  \u201cMany things.\u201d\n\n\nThe woman smiled and patted the rocky bank next to her.  \u201cSit a while and tell me about it.\u201d\n\n\nSir Osis hesitated a moment before tying Alphonse to a tree and walking to the bank.\n\n\n\u201cGo on.  Sit,\u201d she said pleasantly.\n\n\nHe looked around before sitting a short distance back from the water. \n\n\n\u201cNow, go on.  What ails you, sir?  Thy secrets are all safe with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell I\u2026I abandoned my duty to protect myself.\u201d\n\n\nThe woman raised her eyebrows and smiled.  \u201cIf thou hadn\u2019t, would thee have been able to fulfill thy duty anyway?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.  Well, I don\u2019t know.  Likely not, but maybe.  There was a chance I could have helped everyone, but I won\u2019t know now.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI see.  Well, what\u2019s done is done.  There is naught thou mayest do by dwelling on the past.  Thou shouldst set thine eyes on what thou mayest do in the future that thou wouldst not have been able to do.\u201d  She moved closer to him and rested her head on her hands.  \u201cThou must thirst.  Wilt thou not take some water?  Then stay a while and rest until the morning.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Reject Her Offer", "result": "Sir Osis slowly pulled away from the woman and stood up.  \u201cThank you, but I must be going.   If I am to make things right, I cannot tarry here.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cArt thou certain?  The forest is a dangerous place at night,\u201d she said with an incredibly worried look on her face.\n\n\n\u201cI am sure I can manage to find my way safely.\u201d  He bowed and untied his horse.\n\n\n\u201cAt least have a drink!  Here,\u201d she beckoned him to come closer, but he turned away. \n\n\n\u201cFare well,\u201d he called as he went back into the woods.  The urge to change his mind and turn around was strong, but he resisted even looking back at her.  Something had not been right about his conversation with her.  Saying things like that to a woman whose name he didn\u2019t even know was not something he did.  He decided to chalk that up to is current physical condition.\n\n\nAs the sun set, and Sir Osis walked along, unsure of where he was and even less sure of where he was going, he began to regret his decision to reject the woman\u2019s offer.  It wasn\u2019t as if she was some witch intent on stealing his liver to make a hair-growth potion for his uncle.  Even if she was, at least he would have been rested enough to defend himself.  He had had nothing to eat nor to drink since the morning, and that only made the feeling of his brain being squeezed like a sponge even more intense.\n\n\nThe crescent moon provided scant light, and Sir Osis realized he was going to have to spend a night in the forest.  He did not trust himself to sleep in a tree in his state, and then he would have to worry about his horse.  That meant his only option was to build a fire.  He was starting to get cold anyway.  He searched around for the driest kindling he could find and stripped the inner bark off a rotting log for tinder.  The kindling was not dry enough and did nothing but smolder for some time.  With much coaxing and relighting, Sir Osis finally established something that resembled a flame, fed it, and soon fell asleep on the damp ground. \n\n\nWhen morning came, he noticed what appeared to be the tracks of a man circling his camp--he noticed them after lying on the ground all stiff and unrefreshed for a half hour anyway.  He panicked for a good fifteen seconds before seeing that his horse was still there.  Then the next order of business was to find out who had left the tracks.  He followed them all around the muddy area his fire had been in until he noticed to a spot where the unknown person must have had kneeled before the fire.  Then he looked down and noticed his own muddy knees\u2026and the size of the tracks\u2026\n\n\nHe hurriedly started doing elaborate leg stretches in an attempt to show any passer-byes that he had not been tracking his own movements and was only preparing for his morning cardio work-out.   It must have worked, because nobody commented on his display. \n\n\nSir Osis could think more clearly now, and he was hungry.  He looked around the forest to see where he was and made sure to leave evidence that he had camped there, lest he only end up in the same place in his wanderings.  Then he untied Alphonse and began his journey once more. \n\n\nIt was only an hour before he heard the sound of a cart rolling down a dirt road.  He followed the sound until he reached it and caught up to the wagon.    \n\n\n\u201cMight you spare me some water?\u201d he asked the driver.\n\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t carrying water on me,\u201d the wrinkled woman replied.\n\n\nWhere ever she was going could not have been far, in that case.  \u201cWhose land is this?\u201d\n\n\nAgainst all odds, her already heavily hooded eyes narrowed.  It was certainly not usual to have strange men on ponies come riding out of the forest unsure of where they were, well, not on a Wednesday, at least.  \u201cLord Feithid\u2019s for another half-day\u2019s ride.  Now just where are you venturing to?  Nothing criminal, I hope.\u201d\n\n\nWhat a pretty piece of information this was!  You lose the daughter, and you end up on the father\u2019s land.  All he could do was slowly nod.  Of course, this is how things would turn out.  After a moment he managed to smile at the old woman.  \u201cVerily, I was meaning to go to his castle.  I had lost my way after a misguided venture born from the desire to pursue the noble beast that is the most magnificent stag\u2014er, beaver I had ever seen.  Alas, in the process I lost both my way and my weapon, but Providence hath smiled upon me and brought me to you!\u201d\n\n\nShe gave him a hard stare before chuckling.  \u201cCalm yourself, lad.  I wouldn\u2019t turn you in for poaching.  Whatever night you\u2019ve had must have been rough all right\u2026can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s blood or dirt on you.  You\u2019ll get cleaned up, and I\u2019ll fix you something to eat when we get to my home, how\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat would be most excellent and appreciated, fair woman.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cName\u2019s Mary.  You trying to sound like some sort of character in a pageant thing, lad?\u2019\n\n\nSir Osis had no idea what she meant by that and could only answer with a low \u201cNo?\u201d\n\n\nMary shook her head and muttered something about the effect on modern entertainment on the younger generations.\n\n\nHer home was a small affair with a thatched roof.  A few hogs had to be shooed away from the door, but they took the offense reasonably well.  The interior smelled of boiled cabbage and honey mead, the latter of which Mary immediately poured a cupful of and gave to Sir Osis.  The dehydrated knight downed it immediately.\n\n\n\u201cDid you tell me your name?  Tell me again anyway,\u201d she asked, pouring him another cup.\n\n\n\u201cO...Orthopt.  I was named after my sire.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI see.  Well, you can stay and eat, Orthopt, but then you best be getting on with your business.  My husband\u2019ll be home for his dinner noon, and he won\u2019t want you in his chair.\u201d\n\n\nHe stiffened, somewhat disappointed that he was being kicked out so early, but it was kind enough for her to be feeding him in the state she found him in.  \n\n\n\u201cFar be it from me to cause inconvenience for your husband.  I cannot express my gratitude for your hospitality enough.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to it.  Now go rinse your face off, and food\u2019ll be ready when you get back.\u201d\n\n\nSir Osis went outside obediently and looked around a bit until he had located a well.  As he wiped the blood and grime from his face and arms, he thought about what he would do next.  Would he return home as if nothing had happened?  It would be suspicious if he were to be the only one who was safe, and that was not something he could hide when his lord and half the village knew what he had gone to do.  If he went that route, he would be better off visiting Lord Feithid and making up something about being sent ahead with a message or something.  That could be a good alibi.   Maybe he should just come out and tell Lord Feithid what had happened.  It was possible that it was not too late for a rescue mission.\n\n\nHe did have another option.  Disappearing for a while could be the best plan.  Everyone would assume he had died or have been sold, and after all this had blown over, he could come back and say he had won his freedom in a duel against a two-headed Norse jarl or something along those lines. \n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to Lord Feithid", "result": "Going into hiding was a ridiculous plan.  Sure, this woman hadn\u2019t seemed to have caught on, but somebody would eventually. \n\n\nWith new resolution, he returned to the house.  The cabbage stew Mary gave him had about as much substance to it as a shredded piece of paper in a hogshead barrel did, but it was food, and that was good enough.  After thanking his hostess once more and ensuring Alphonse had had plenty to drink, Sir Osis set out to the castle. \n\n\nLord Feithid\u2019s castle made Sir Osis\u2019s home look like a plague-ravaged mountain hamlet in comparison.  Even with so many serfs tending the fields, navigating the crowds of the outer castle was like making his way through a herd of stampeding cattle.  The sensory overload was too much for him, and he had to stop and just sit at the gate to the upper levels of the castle before he could continue onward. \n\n\nAs he made his way, he grew more and more certain that he should have just turned around and gone right back into those woods.  He didn\u2019t even know Lord Feithid.  How was he supposed to find him without being thrown out as some crazy man by the guards? \n\n\nEventually he reminded himself that he was a knight and equal to or above any of these guards, even if they were in a bigger castle.

This was probably not the most noble of choices, but his choices lately had been less than noble anyway.  All he had to do was find work somewhere, and this entire situation would be avoided.  He knew a little about farming.  He was surrounded by farmers, and that had to count for something.  Sailing was also an option.   Whatever his choice, there was no way he was staying at Feithid\u2019s or anywhere near home. \n\n\nBefore he left the woman\u2019s home that afternoon, he got directions to the next nearest settlement of size, a seaside town called Criogaid, which was just a day\u2019s ride away.  Then he set out along the road once more, somewhat more energized than before. \n\n\nAside from when he was nearly frightened to death by a large beetle, the next day and night passed Sir Osis by with little to remember until he reached Criogaid. \n\n\nCriogaid was a good-sized settlement, but with an apparent atmosphere of drowsiness, aside from the area near the docks.  While there were certainly farms and pasture in the area, it was saltwater that ran through the heart and veins of Criogaid.  Sir Osis had been here once before some years ago and knew that an inn was certainly a wise investment here for those who did not wish to have their belongings stolen.  Unfortunately, he had no money for a room.  Fortunately, he had nothing to worry about being stolen, except his horse.  A night not on a damp patch of mud and leaves was not unappealing either. \n\n\nThis left only one real option.\n\n\nSir Osis grabbed a drink from the well, rode down to the docks, and began to sing with all his might.  \u201cWomen, women, love of women. Make bare purse with some men!\u201d  He had seen men doing this in the capital, and, truly, they were, in essence, minstrels.   \u201cWhat nobler occupation is there than bringing joy and entertainment to the world?\u201d he asked himself before deciding that question was most powerful when left unanswered.  \u201cSome be brown, and some be white; some be tender as the tripe!\u201d  He sang his heart out for twenty minutes with no results save a few people coming to watch for a while before leaving.  Apparently, the folks in Criogaid were not too keen on paying for something they could hear any night for free in a public house.

By the time he was back in the town square, he had forgotten the slight he had suffered at the hands of the merchant and was already scheming of how to get more money.  He figured that the coin he had was perhaps enough to sleep in a stable or even a cheap room (you know how prices differ from place to place) for a day, but he needed more if he planned to eat anything that had neither come out of nor was meant to go into a horse. \n\n\nThen he saw something in the dirt below himself and smiled.  Sir Osis stooped to pick up the coin, shoving aside some ragamuffin who had the same idea, and wiped the dust and manure off.  Maybe he would be able to get some real food with this.  He pocketed the coin and went to find the cheapest looking inn. \n\n\nUncle Peter\u2019s House was a dingy inn with a rotting roof, a strange smell Sir Osis could not name, and floor rushes that had not been changed in four months, by his estimate.  However, it was a popular place for sailors, it had a very large and attentive female staff, and it was cheap.  The two coins bought Sir Osis a bed and supper, and he quickly fell asleep before he could even finish praying that it would not rain that night.\n\n\nNevertheless, it did not rain, and he woke up the next morning feeling more refreshed than he had that week.

Erik was not thrilled about his lac of sailing experience, but appreciated that he was over the age of ten.  He couldn\u2019t handle any more scrawny mama\u2019s boys than he had, he said.  It was settled that Sir Osis could sleep on board the ship with the crew until they set sail again the next day, and Captain Erik left to take care of his own business over at Uncle Peter\u2019s. \n\n\nNow there was the matter of Alphonse.  He had been a gift and served him well, but he could hardly be brought onto a ship for months at a time.  It wouldn\u2019t be good for him anyway.

When he told the mate who he was, he briefly showed Osis around before going back to a nap, and Osis went below deck.  Most of the crew was enjoying their time on land, but there was at least one man in the sleeping quarters, who seemed very happy to see him and immediately introduced himself as Edwin. \n\n\n\u201cYou can take this hammock next to me,\u201d Edwin said with a grin.\n\n\n\u201cI indeed appreciate how welcoming you are being toward me.\u201d\n\n\nEdwin pressed his hand against Osis\u2019s back.  \u201cDon\u2019t even mention it.

This plan was still stupid, but that was an excellent point. \n\n\n\u201cI understand you concern, but as for that,\u201d Sir Osis shifted to regain his authoritarian pose.  \u201cWhile it is certainly true that, apart from our lord, hunting and tracking are not commonly known arts in our village, I cannot do a thing without\u2026the Silver Arrow of Fortune.\u201d  The Silver Arrow of Fortune was an artifact Sir Osis had conjured up while remembering the brooch his lord\u2019s wife commonly wore, but they didn\u2019t need to know that.\n\n\nThe merchant cocked his head.  \u201cAnd this Arrow of Fortune you need, why?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt brings fortune, naturally.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back just for some superstition.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was blessed by the Pope.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have some medals blessed by the Pope which they didn\u2019t take.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was used to stab the side of Christ.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that a spear though?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, you see, with translation\u2014\u201d\n\n\nSomeone cleared his throat, and Sir Osis turned to see that John had been watching this exchange.   \u201cThank you for ye help, sir, but I\u2019ll be taking it from here.\u201d  He spoke up to address the group at large.  \u201cNow I understand that you are angry at the loss of what you spent so much of your life in the attaining of, yes, but all that will be worthless if you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\n\nMost of the members of the caravan nodded in agreement, knowing that this was the only reasonable decision. \n\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any questioning of this now.  We\u2019re going back.\u201d \n\n\nThe trip back is very uneventful.  Nobody witnessed the incident of Sir Osis thinking a rustling noise was another bandit and chasing after a squirrel for ten minutes.  It did not happen and was therefore not an event.  By the time they got to the castle, it was dark, and Sir Osis went to his room as soon as possible. \n\n\n\u201cYou received a message while you were out, sir,\u201d a servant told him as he removed his boots.\n\n\n\u201cRemove it from me.  Good night,\u201d Sir Osis responded as he threw his boots across the room and pulled his legs into bed.  That was a concern for the morning\u2014no, not the morning.

He had so many important things to take care of, like how he couldn\u2019t open his eyes longer than three seconds.  There was only one thing to fix that.  He brought his legs back up into the bed and closed his eyes again.  When he woke up again, he has soaked with sweat under the blankets, and a tray of food had been left near his door.  Still not feeling like leaving his room, he took a piss out of his narrow window, congratulated himself on getting most of it outside, and sat down to eat his breakfast.  After eating, writing a letter, and giving some orders to the servants, he went outside. \n\n\nHis steed, a white creature of around ten hands, was saddled and awaiting him.  Named Alphonse, he had been a gift from Queen Justinia, and bore a resemblance to a horse in the sense that it was an equine.  Together, they went out to an empty pasture.  The ground was damp yet, but there was enough grass that what mud was there was not enough to cause any problems.  About two thirds of the way to the far end of the pasture was a weighted bag on a beam.  The beam was set up for practice with a spear and if struck incorrectly, would swivel and send the bag to strike the assailant.  Until the sun started to lower in the sky after the noon, Sir Osis trained without interruption.  Then a rider came up to the pasture before stopping at the gate. \n\n\n\u201cGood afternoon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood afternoon to, Sir Odin of the Liver?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is Sir Osis you are speaking to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve a message from Queen Justinia to all unoccupied knights in the general vicinity, my lord.  There is thought to be a beast living in a nearby portion of Her Majesty\u2019s forest, and several people have gone missing within the past month\u2014more than the usual I mean.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo I am to be on a rescue mission!\u201d Sir Osis exclaimed. \n\n\n\u201cNo, sir.  More of an extermination, if you will.  Her Majesty wants who or whatever is responsible for these disappearances neutralized\u2014killed, if you will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErrrrr\u2026I am not entirely certain that I am the correct man for this.  Perhaps Sir Loin may be a better fit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already searching in his area.  It is necessary\u2014imperative, one may say\u2014that whatever this is be stopped.

All he could do was go out and hope that word reached him of the situation being resolved before he had spent his whole day out there.  Within a half hour, he was in the forest fighting his way through brambles.  He got to thinking; was there a reason whatever he was looking for would be voluntarily putting itself through this?  Not really.  Then he made the decision to go down and search along the river instead.  Now that was a far more pleasant walk, and he could see much farther too.  For some time, he rode along the riverbank, then he got to thinking again.  This spot he could see up ahead looked like a spot he would like if he were some man-eating beast.  Perhaps he should stop there and wait a while, he figured.\n\n\nSo he did.\n\n\nAs he sat by the river, something shiny caught his eye in the water.  Perhaps it was some sort of treasure, he thought.  To still be shiny like this, it could not have been here for long, unless it was gold perhaps.  Naturally, he got on his knees and peered into the water.  The outline of the object danced and warped with the motion of the water.  Then his examination was cut off with the appearance of a brown object smoothly gliding through with the current.  Thinking it was a beaver, he pulled back to see that something was very off about it.  This beaver was swimming backwards?   No, this beaver had a bill like a duck, or perhaps this duck had a body resembling a beaver.  Determined to find out, Sir Osis prodded it with his sword in the hopes of getting it to turn over.  It did not.  It lunged out of the water and onto his face.  Stunned, Sir Osis dropped his sword and rolled over on top of it.  Then the beaver hit Sir Osis with his hindquarters, and Sir Osis felt an excruciating pain go through himself.  All he could do was lie on his back and scream, while the beaver too one last glance at him before slipping back into the river to resume his journey. \n\n\nThe sun was gone and the moon was high before Sir Osis was able to pull himself up again.  Every move he made was difficult, and he cursed the beaver fay that had done this to him.  However, he managed to gather some wood and build a fire to warm himself from lying on the cool ground for so long.  As he sat there, shivering, he dwelt on his available options.  He could turn back and go home, or he could continue on his journey.  He was in need of medical attention and perhaps that of a priest, but those were things he might be able to find if he stopped in another nearby village.  Whatever he decided would have to wait until morning, but it was good to have an idea of things now.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go Home", "result": "This little excursion was over.  Monster hunting and demon beavers were not what he was getting paid for.  He wouldn\u2019t do any good if he died out here anyway.  Mind made up, Sir Osis allowed sleep to come and take him from his pain.  It didn\u2019t come nearly soon enough.  Then next morning, he willed himself to stand up again and called for his horse.  After about ten minutes of that, Alphonse came lumbering to him.  Then Sir Osis made sure nothing was left behind and put out the fire.  The river\u2019s cool water beckoned to him, but he was apprehensive about allowing his face anywhere near a place such a terrible creature allowed his.  Thirst proved a stronger opponent than fear, however, and he carefully got a quick drink and some more water for later\u2014swirling the water in front of him with a long branch every few seconds to scare anything off all the while, just in case.  Then it was time to leave this cursed place.  Every movement he made was difficult and there was pain with every breath\u2014without breath too.  He\u2019d tried holding it to see if there was a difference. \n\n\nAfter a couple hours, he had returned to the highway and was enjoying the feeling of the warm sun against his back.  When he had reached a point he recognized as being roughly three miles from his home, he saw a man as old as the sun and moon bent under the weight of a pack that must have weighed twice as much as him.  \u201cGood day, sir!\u201d he called in a voice which surprised Sir Osis in its clarity. \n\n\n\u201cI suppose one may call it that under certain circumstances.  However, I shall be of the slight inclination to disagree with you.  It is not yet a good day.  Perhaps in a few hours, it will have sufficiently improved enough to be called middling, but for now it is a day that I would very much prefer to eliminate from my memory entirely.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, sir,\u201d the ancient one said flatly before regaining his enthusiasm and setting down his pack before Sir Osis and his horse.  The weight may have appeared to have been removed from his back, yet he was bent at the same sharp angle as before.  \u201cWhatever it is that\u2019s ailing you, I have a product that would make a fine solution to it.  In fact,\u201d he chuckled as if thinking of the perfect joke to tell his friend later, \u201cI may have several!  What is it you need?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is not a simple matter to\u2014\u201d\n\n\nThe old peddler cut him off.  \u201cI understand perfectly, sir.  Actually, I don\u2019t, but I wouldn\u2019t think ill of you for it,\u201d he said while giving Sir Osis a reassuring pat on the back. \n\n\n\u201cHave you laid eyes on the cursed beaver too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, many.  That\u2019s the point in which I usually remember that I need to be hitting the road once more and bid my companion farewell though, sir.  You\u2019ll learn in time.\u201d  He brought out a couple of glass bottles.  One was clear with a deep brown, viscous substance inside, and the other was a watery substance with a color impossible to determine from behind the tinted glass it was in.  He opened the bottle of watery liquid and inhaled deeply before pulling back an shaking his head.  \u201cNow this will cure anything,\u201d he said with a laugh before tucking it back into his pack and smelling the brown bottle.  \u201cThis here is the one we\u2019re looking for.\u201d  He held it out to Sir Osis before drawing his hand back.  \u201cI am correct in believing you do have some coin on you, sir.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Ask How Much He Needs", "result": " \u201cWhat is the price you are asking?\u201d\n\n\nSir Osis figured that if he had the funds there was no point in continuing to suffer like he was.  The man born before the mountains chuckled to himself before replying, \u201cFor what it is, a bargain.  A copper coin should do you just nicely.\u201d\n\n\nThe transaction was made, and the peddler tipped his hat.  \u201cA pleasant journey to you, sir,\u201d he said before hoisting his pack back onto his back.\n\n\nWhen Sir Osis received the bottle, he was surprised to see it engraved with some sort of markings.  He was not sure what they were, but they looked to him almost like of some sort of script.  \u201cAllow me to inquire as to\u2026\u201d he started before trailing off when he realized that he could no longer see the man who had watched the rivers form in his youth.  He questioned his sight for a moment before deciding that a ridge had hidden the peddler from view.  Then his body ordered his mind to pay attention to the elixir before them.  He removed the stopper, being sure to save it in his pocket for later, and held his breath before bringing the mouth of the bottle to his lips.  It was to his surprise that the medicine tasted nothing of the wretched concoctions he had been forced to take when sick as a child.  It had a strong smell that burned his nostrils slightly, but the flavor was sweet.  He took three good draughts of the viscous substance before wiping his mouth.  He was no longer in pain, but something else had happened.  Overcome by dizziness, Sir Osis dismounted and curled up on the side of the road\u2014feeling unable to go any farther.  Then he felt consciousness slip away.\n\n\nSir Osis awoke to an overwhelming floral smell.  With no hesitation, he jumped up and drew his sword, fearing the worst.  However, all he was greeted with was a woman in very strange dress making a rather pissed-off expression.  She quickly backed away when he drew his sword but her demeaner became no more pleasant than before.  In fact, she began to yell at him in a strange language he had never heard anything like before.  Sir Osis sheathed his sword and bowed slightly.  \u201cI am afraid that I never did learn any of that Russian.  You are Russian?\u201d  He had no idea what this strange woman was, but Russian was a very good guess, he thought. \n\n\nWhen Sir Osis had sheathed his sword, the woman calmed down considerably, yet she was not any more favorable to Sir Osis\u2019s presence in her sight than before, and Sir Osis learned that \u201cGet the hell out of my place\u201d was the same in many languages that day.  As relieved as he was that he did not appear to have been enslaved, he was not pleased in the least with this situation.  Out on the street, he could here that everybody seemed to speak whatever that woman had been screaming, they all had the same strange look about them, and they all wore those strange clothes.  Strangest of all however was that now and then someone would pass by who appeared to be blue.  Now, the interplay of light and shadow can have strange effects on the visual perception of man, but no shadow followed around individuals throughout their days, the color of a sunny sky in September all the while.  That\u2019s right.  There were no tricks being played.  Some of those people were blue.  Now, whether it was natural pigmentation or it was a paint was a mystery to the knight, but either way, it was quite visually shocking, and pondering it distracted him from the strange situation he was in\u2026for a time. \n\n\nIt was five minutes before Sir Osis looked around and came to the full realization that he was certainly not anywhere near home anymore, and he had no idea how he got there or by what transportation he should return.  This was fine.  He could handle this.  He took a deep breath to calm himself and let it out along with a profane deluge.  This did not make him feel any more cheerful, but now he could consider his situation with a clearer mind.  The clearer mind told him to skedaddle before whatever had brought him to this place came back.  As he wandered, he realized that the city he was in was much larger than anything he had been near before and not a single person was speaking his language.  He tried to wake up or to change his surroundings, but If this was a dream, he had no control over it.  As the sun hung low, he came to the edge of the city and looked out at the landscape before him.

Then he settled in to begin his new life. \n\n\nIt took him some time, but he eventually managed to communicate in the new language.  He found that nobody knew how he could get home, nor had they even heard of it.  All he could really do was work at his new job guarding a large inn and brothel and hope some merchant passing through knew how he could get home.  None of them did, and after years of waiting, Sir Osis gave up hope.  He began to spend his nights smoking opium and enjoying the company of blue-skinned females\u2014with which he was very popular.

There was no more time for hesitation.  He heard a shout before him and sprinted out into the night.  He ran for about five minutes before doubling over and gasping for breath.  Nobody was following him.  Oh well.  He needed the cardio exercise anyway.  As Sir Osis caught his breath, the fact that he was in a strange place with no idea where home was hit him once again.  What was he supposed to do now?  Just walk until he found home?  Who knew how far that was?  Even the air smelled different here.  After going through a few minutes of panic and catching his breath, Sir Osis too a good look at the path before him.  It snaked through hills and fields before disappearing into forbidding darkness.  Perhaps there was a settlement or a home he could stop at not far off.  There was only one way to find out.  He resumed his trek, this time at a much more manageable pace.  In order to occupy his mind with something other than worries, Sir Osis started taking in every detail of the night around him.  Some of the sounds of the night were familiar, others, nothing like anything he had ever heard.  All sound was unresting, unceasing, endless.   It was almost unnerving to hear so much which he could neither identify nor see.  Actually, it was very unnerving.  He decided he should probably stop concentrating on it, but that only made things worse.  The thought crossed his mind that he may never hear a human voice again, and that thought scared him.  Lowly, he even started singing to himself some old song his mother used to sing about a lady and her lover that turned into a horse\u2014or was it a horse that was her lover?  The details were unimportant.  The song had the desired effect, and Sir Osis had hardly realized it before he had entered into the jungle itself.  The moon was blocked here, making the surroundings difficult to see, and Sir Osis soon decided that he should stop for the night.  First he would need firewood.  He wasn\u2019t about to go sleeping in some strange forest without a fire.  There could be wolves there, after all, and perhaps the ground was colder than was the air. \n\n\nThe leaf litter on the forest floor was damp, and Sir Osis worried that he would be unable to find anything dry enough to light.  The intense darkness was not helping matters whatsoever.  While he was kicking at the ground in front of him as he walked in search of a log large enough to be worth stripping the inner bark from, he ran into a fallen tree and fell onto his knees.  Then he heard a hiss, and something struck him in the hand.  Muttering something under his breath, he looked around to see what had bitten him but found nothing.  Well this was worrying.  Still, he felt no pain beyond the initial bite, which itched a bit, and he figured he would probably be fine.  Then he built the fire and settled in for the night.  It was only a few short hours before he woke up vomiting and with tightness in his chest.  So that bite was something to worry about after all.  He decided to wait things out a bit in case they got better.  They didn\u2019t.  By the time he decided he needed to go back to the city to receive help, he was unable to walk.
