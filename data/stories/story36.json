Unfortunately you don't care to play these servents. the games seem so empty ... so TWO DIMENSIONAL, as if there were no substance behind them. So you rarely do well in the games against your servents.

You must defeat him.\nSuddenly a Messenger appears.. It seems that there is an urgent message from your First Knight Georgiovanni.\nYou forgot that you are required to take an annual trip on this day to the City of Kleavelandia to make an appearance at the annual Wizard Convention, which was taking place at a large castle, the largest library in the land.

Unfortunately your information was wrong, and you find that you have actually gone to the wrong palace. The wizard convention is to be at the KSU (Klevelandia samantics Utopia) rather than KASE (Klevelandia Association of Semantics and Earth) Palace.\nYou turn and head on your noble horse to the correct palace and arrive unfortunately rather late. However the Wizard are so glad that you, as master of ceremonies, have shown up at all. They were beginning to get worried, though they knew where you were at all times.\nKnowing that you will never make it back in time to face Alexis in Chess, you just hope that his sensibilities will rule and he will await your noble return.\nWhen you finally DO return to your estate on your tired but noble steed Kevorsello, you notice immediately something bright red on your door.\nPainted on your doorway, in bright bold letters are the words\n\"STAAN IS A WOOOOOOOOOSIE!\"\nlargely, huge, all the nobles you are sure have already seen this insult.\nall of your servents as well.\nYou ask around and everyone says that Alexis came, and out of anger that you weren't here, defaced your property then ran, unwilling to wait.\nYou consider stripping the Baron of his nobility but you realize that you cannot do that until you are truly king, and you will never be king if the evil Alexis considers to challenge you and you fail to live up to that challenge.", "action_results": [{"action": "Refuse to play the evil Alexis!", "result": "You decide despite all the heckling that you will not give in to Alexis's evil mockery and will not play him.
