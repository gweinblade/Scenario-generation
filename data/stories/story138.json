I've made it in time.\n\nI take my seat. I pull my textbook from my backpack... This is why I'm glad that we always use the same classroom.\n\n\"Class open your textbook to page 397. To continue from last week, the mathematical term i means what?\" He pauses for an answer. No one does. \"It's a non-real thing used to solve problems.\" I stop paying attention. Old Rockford always reviews for the first ten minutes.\n\nI glance over at Oscar. He gives a rambunctious grin. I give a small nod. He returns one. Our plan tonight will hopefully work. It's not very immoral. At least, our dorms will like it.\n\nI look at Milton. He's paying close attention to the teacher. He's happy today. It's his fourteenth birthday. We'll give him a... gift to remember. Of course, we won't ruin his birthday. We'll wait until midnight.\n\nI put my attention back onto my crusty old teacher. I don't want to get in trouble now and miss out on all the fun coming up.\n\nHe's still talking about that stupid i. Darn, why can't the day to end soon?\n\nI sit in my chair and let my mind wander. I have to pass the time somehow.\n\nI look at these boringly familiar walls. Everything's made out of brick. Well, the tables aren't. I never saw a brick table before.

We grab our backpacks and rush out of the classroom. We do not stop running until we reach our dorm. When the door closes, we both grab our supplies.\n\n\"I got the shaving cream.\" Oscar laughs a bit like an evil genius.\n\"I got the hammer and nail.\"\n\nWe both show the... repurposed items to the other. The staff hates our pranks even though everybody does it.\n\n\"Let's put 'em back before the others get here.\" I nod in reply to Oscar. We hide the items in our drawers.\n\"Who did you take the cream from?\"\n\"I just found it.\" Oscar lies. I guess I shouldn't know.\n\nWe both laugh. I can hear their screams already.\n\n\"Hey, what's the joke?\" asks one of our dormmates. We both shrug. Well, the others are arriving. Now, all Oscar and I have to do is wait for midnight.\n\n>Another one of our dormmates comes inside very excited. \"Hey guys!\" He looks around to see how many of us are hare. \"The twelvers challenged us to a soccer game!\" We charge out the door in moments. Like a herd of buffalo, nothing can get in our stampede to the fields. We pass the other dorms, we run around the central water fountain, and we gallop by the dozens of buildings.\n\nWe all stop. For only a moment, there are only two dozen boys, a soccer field, and a massive forest. The moment ends when the twelvers arrive. They jeer at us sixers. We jeer back at them. It's all in jest. Dorm rivalries normally exist only to provide us entertainment. Well, the exception is the oners. I hate those jerks.\n\nOne of the sixers places the soccer ball in the middle of the field. My friends all get into their positions. I'm defense. I wish I knew what this position is called, but we're amateurs. All I have to do is protect our goalie.\n\nTwo boys, one from each dorm, volunteer to be a referee. They quickly say the rules. I already know them. It's no cheating and best of twenty.\n\nI gaze at my opponents. We should be able to beat them. Our boys are more athletic.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I see girls walking up. I recognize one of them as my old friend Maria. There's a good chance that she'll want to play with one of the teams. The other girls might also. All of them are among the better athletes we have at this school.\n\nI could call out to them.

Others, like Oscar, seem very unhappy with this turn of events.\n\nThe game starts. Within seconds, it becomes apparent that we are going to win. Our best members and the girls overwhelm the twelver's defense.\n\n\"Thanks.\" Startled, I turn around. There's Maria. Why isn't she playing too?\n\"I thought you wanted to play.\"\n\"Oh, I do. My turn should come eventually. I wanted to thank you first. What you did was kind.\"\n\"Hey, what are friends for?\"\n\"Yeah... I could do better in that regard.\" She looks at her feet.\n\"Don't be glum.\"\n\"Sorry, I just... We don't talk much anymore. During the noon break, would you want to talk?\"\n\"Sure.\" I nod.\n\nTwo boys on our team run off the field, and one tells us to replace them. Maria and I run onto the field. She's on offense, so I don't get to talk to her until the game ends. It was a victory: 20-4.\n\nOscar runs over to me. We hive-five each other.\n\nThat was awesome. We crushed 'em.\" My friend laughs.\n\"You like my choice now?\"\n\"Yeah yeah, the girls were... fine.\"\n\"Well, it looks like the others are all leaving. What are you going to do?\"\nI'm gonna go swim... No, I just remembered. I got some homework to do. See you tonight, right?\nOf course.\n\nOscar walks away. I'm the last one on the field.

Along the way, I pass by the buildings were we are supposed to learn. I think everybody likes the physical building more. It's a new edition to the school grounds. I find it significantly less creepy than the other buildings. They are dark and brick. It reminds me of a place out of Mr... Uh, what's his name? I learned about him two weeks ago... Oh, it reminds me of a place found in Mr. Poe's stories. Whoever designed it must have been depressed or something like that.\n\n\"Mr. Lawrence.\" I stop in my tracks. Why is Mr. Rockford calling my name? Did they find out about our plans for tonight?\n\"Y-Yes, Mr. Rockford?\" I try not to look nervous.\n\"I'd like to talk to you about your grades.\" Thank goodness, I'm safe. It looks like I'll be here for a while. He's standing next to me.\n\"Uh, I thought my grades are fine.\"\n\"They are 'fine', but they are not good. You are sitting directly under an A.\"\n\"Yeah, that's great.\"\n\"You motivation, however, is absolutely not. I want you to have an A in my course when we finish for the year.\"\n\"Will do.

Come by my office any time during school hours in which I am not teaching.\"\n\"Yes Sir, I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\"That is all, Mr. Lawrence.\"\n\"Bye.\"\n\nI continue walking. I take my time to look at the trees. One of the few things I like about this place is that it's in a forest. We're far away from most people. The entire town pretty much used just to serve the school, but colleges do the same thing. Anyway, the trees are nice to look at. I can see dozens of trees no matter which way I look. If I look North, I see hundreds.\n\nI pass the graveyard. Mrs. Murdock rakes leaves in there. At night, she sleeps in a little house by the cemetery to keep out looters. The only problem is that there has never been a looter and Mrs. Murdock can sleep through anything.\n\nI decide to sit against a tree and take a nap.

It's a full moon, and I know the school grounds better than the back of my hand.\n\nI come through the backdoor just as a teacher comes in the front. He does our roll-call, and I act like I was not late. The teacher never knows.

This bed feels very hard and makes my back hurt after I wake up. With all the money that the school gets, I wish they could buy softer beds. A kid who went to a military school said that their beds were just as hard. I find that unfair. We are boys. Why should we endure such horrible beds? I will not fall asleep.\n\nI can't wait to hear the oners' screaming. Milton always sleeps by an opened window. It'll be easy for us to his him with the explosion. I will not fall asleep.\n\nI hear a single, quiet ringing from the bells. It is midnight. I methodically, silently get out of my bed and wake Oscar. I cover his mouth in case he says something.

If we can make it to our dorm, then we'll be safe.\"\n\"Yeah... let's get the nail in now.\"\n\nOscar gives me the can of shaving cream. I gently hammer in the nail.

I carefully hand Oscar the can of shaving cream.\n\n\"Ready?\" I ask.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nWe both stand inches away from the window. Milton is one of the boys snoring. Oscar hurls it inside. The can hits Milton in the gut. The impact causes shaving cream to fly everywhere. The Oners scream like little girls.\n\nWe laugh hysterically. Cream, screaming boys, and bed sheets are everywhere. Then, some of the boys open the door. They see us two shadowy figures.\n\nI say, \"Run.\" We run in different directions. Oscar heads to the dorms. I head in a different direction.

The oners are already to close.\n\nEverything becomes much darker. I take a glance and see a cloud covering the moon. I make it to the graveyard. I twist and turn through the graves. I could run through here with my eyes closed. The others have to slow down. They're never in here. I think they are scared as well.\n\nI take a glance behind me. I can hardly see them. I'm almost out of the graveyard. I twist my ankle on something. It might be sprained, and it hurts more than my lungs. I slide behind a large grave. I hope they\u2019ll miss me. If not, I'm toast.\n\nThey slow down. Panting, one asks, \"Where's he?\" Another says, \"Don't know.\" between his breaths. I crawl around the grave. They could have seen me. I try to slow my breathing, but my body refuses to comply.\n\nI feel a rock with my hand. Getting an idea, I throw it into the woods. The boys hear it. One says, \"There he is!\" they stampede off.
