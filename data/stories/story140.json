You knew the reward for driving out those wolves would be small, but this will only last for about two more days at the inn. This is not what you had in mind as you left Barthville with your two best friends to become adventurers. You were dreaming of glory and a luxury lifestyle, not a meager existence of driving away wild animals to barely make ends meet.\n\n\nYou start your usual trot from the guard post to the Rusty Tankard, the small and quite poor inn you're staying at in Galenwall with Rowan and Isolda. As usual, you take the route across the marketplace in hopes of picking up on some rumors or problems from the locals you could earn some money from. You walk by a hunter who is selling a bunch of large rodents, with long, mottled, ochercolored fur. You think they are called Duneskewers, from the desert Shayu. Listening to him you happen to hear their conversation with the merchant he is selling them to.\n\n\n\"This is even worse than the last catch you wanted to sell me. Why all of the bad luck lately?\" the dwarven merchant with a rather fat belly asks.\n\n\n\"Bah, don't even ask. Since that stupid pyramid rose up from the sand again, these little buggers hide. And I'm not going near that thing,\" the dark skinned elven hunter remarks.\n\n\n\"A pyramid you say? Wouldn't that mean there is a load of treasure in there? Those are known to hold gold and all sort of trinkets.\"\n\n\n\"Even if it does, it's not worth for me to risking my life. I'm a bloody hunter, not some adventurer.\"\n\n\nAt this point, you interrupt and ask them for directions to the pyramid. The hunter tells you where it is, but also that you should stay away. You don't listen to that part. All you know is that this could be your opportunity to solve your financial problems for good.\n\n\nAs you open the door to the Rusty Tankard, you immediately spot Isolda. Not only is she the only elf in the inn, but you also can not miss her wild, flowing, fire-red hair, and her colorful robes. Her pale skin and innocent blue eyes give her a childlike sweetness, but boy can this girl have a temper when anyone disrespects her or her friends. Her nature towards you and Rowan is always caring though. It fits, given she is the healer of your group and your only mage.\n\n\nSpotting Rowan is not that easy. First, he's a dwarf and therefore not the tallest guy. Second, he does not dress as vibrantlyl as Isolda. His dark-gray Stetson hat is laying on the table in front of him. His head with the bushy black beard is resting on his arm, seemingly bored from having to wait for his dinner. As always, his black and gray clothing is sat neat, and his massive crossbow is resting against the wall.\n\n\nAs you stride over, both their heads perk up. \"Someone seems to be in a good mood,\" Isolda points out in her soft, calm voice. You are surprised to hear her lack of emotion sometimes. She always told you that's quite normal for an elf though.\n\n\n\"Better because our payment was so high,\" Rowan snorts, a little agitated. His rough voice is in stark contrast to Isolda's. His heavy dwarven accent is clear as day. Also, the fact that he tends to swallow the first word of his sentences makes him sound like he is always drunk.\n\n\n\"Even better, my friends. I found our next great opportunity,\" you happily tell them, leaning in on the table.\n\n\n\"Great opportunity?\" Isolda seems to be quite suspicious of that. \"You always tell us they are great and then they end up just enough to keep ourselves going.\"  \n\n\n\"I had one silver for every time you told us that, I would not have to sit here right now,\" Rowan grumbles.\n\n\n\"Look, I know we did not have the best run up until now but hear me out. This time I have something big.\" You then explain them what you overheard at the market. You also tell them that your payment from the last job could be just enough to get you the gear to go through with this adventure.\n\n\n\"I'm not sure that's a good idea. I mean you were warned by everyone knowing of it to stay away. What if that place is too dangerous for us?\" Isolda states her concern.\n\n\n\"Please, I can't do this without you guys. It could be our only chance to achieve something great,\" you start pleading with them. Isolda looks you deep in your eyes and seems to realize the desperation you have inside you.\n\n\n\"Well fine.\"\n\n\n\"Better be worth it mates,\" Rowan says standing up to shoulder his crossbow. With a look of determination and your two best friends, you stride out of the tavern towards your adventure.", "action_results": [{"action": "Entering the Tomb", "result": "You look upwards just to barely make out the tip of the giant pyramid in front of you. The walls of the sandstone structure are smooth to the touch, and even though it was buried, the pyramid shows no sign of aging on the outside. The pitch black entrance is right before you, like a gaping mouth trying to swallow you whole. Your friends and you all stand before it speechless, not sure of how to comprehend the fact that you're truly about to enter that massive structure.\n\n\n\"Can't fucking believe it. That mad hunter did speak the truth,\" Rowan suddenly blurts out.\n\n\n\"Did I promise too much now?\" your eyes widen in excitement. You stretch out your arms and give a hearty laugh.\n\n\n\"Well, there is still no prove of any riches in there. We should be careful and try not to disturb things too much in there. Who knows what creatures dwell through that,\" Isolda calmly states.\n\n\n\"Only one way to find out,\" you say with a shrug and get a torch out of your pack. After lighting it and drawing your sword, you start marching into the ancient stone structure. Rowan follows with his crossbow loaded and pointed forward at an angle, so he can shoot whatever could come up in front of you. Isolda lights her staff and walks behind the both of you.\n\n\nAfter a while of walking forward and lighting up the wall sconces as you go so the path becomes more lit, you enter a round room. In the center of the room is a fountain with a big statue of a muscular man. The man is wearing robes and ornate armor. His head is clad in a helmet with a feather crown. In his right hand he is holding a scepter towards the ceiling, while his left hand seems to be holding an imperial orb. While you walk around lighting up the wall sconces with your torch, Isolda inspects the statue.\n\n\n\"This seems to be a depiction of the first emperor of Shayu. Sadly, I only recognize the name, but I can't read the whole script,\" she states with a slight scowl on her face.\n\n\n\"Guess there is no reason for sightseeing,\" Rowan says towards you. \"Two ways out of here it seems. Which one you wanna try?\"\n\n\nRowan always was quite straight forward and seemed to be a go-with-the-flow kind of guy. Isolda on the other hand always tried her hardest to find out as much as possible about what was before her, sometimes getting lost in details. Oh, the memories that's bringing back. It reminds you of the day when you first set out from Barthville.\n\n\nThinking about which way to go you examine the paths more closely. The left path is completely pitch black, while the right one seems to have a faint green light at the end.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leaving Barthville (optional backstory)", "result": "How long you have been waiting for this day. All the time you were preparing and plotting with your two best friends to leave your shitty little hometown to become adventurers. Your dad used to always scold you when you were telling him about your idea. Always saying to be reasonable and become a farmer just like him. That was no life for you. You wanted excitement and adventure, not cows and endless days of tedious work. Tonight was the night.\n\n\nYou were sitting at the cherry tree on the backside of Barthville's graveyard waiting for Rowan and Isolda under the soft blue moonlight. After waiting for what felt like hours, you could start to hear two voices talking with each other. With a sigh, you also noticed that there seemed to be an argument going on. \"Do you two always have to be bickering about something?\" you asked with a small smile.\n\n\n\"Is not my fault the elf is always so incredibly careful. Thought we already decided to leave towards Sandrossa,\" your friend Rowan said while crossing his arms behind his head.\n\n\n\"And I already told you, Rowan. While Sandrossa is a great place to start setting out into the wide world on a ship, the terrain to get there is far more dangerous and tricky to pass. Also, we would have to climb the Alabasta mountain range without much in terms of climbing gear. That's why I suggested Galenwall,\" Isolda ends her monologue.\n\n\n\"Bah, Galenwall. Would rather go directly towards Sandrossa than dealing with Shayu. Am a dwarf. Like myself some mountains and not sand.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, alright, seems like I have to, once again, be the voice of reason. So, Isolda, why Galenwall? I mean, other places are closer, and the desert isn't that much easier to trespass than the mountains,\" you try to arbitrate the situation.\n\n\n\"If Rowan would have heard me out, he would already know why,\" Isolda then draws a map from her pack and lays it out in front of you. \"If we trespass the Fayrun forest towards Galenwall we can save one day of travel, and it would be far less dangerous than the mountains. Besides, we have no climbing gear, so we would have to make another detour at the foot of the mountain range to reach one of the dwarven villages in order to acquire some. Also, Galenwall is one of the biggest cities on this continent. I'm sure we'll find the most work there to start out our career as adventurers,\" Isolda finishes with a smile.\n\n\n\"Sounds like a quite solid plan there. So, Rowan, are you with us if we take that route?\"\n\n\n\"Course I am with you buddy. As much as I would like to go towards Sandrossa, I don't want to travel for ages with just the elf and you as company. Could not bear that constant blabbering in my ears all day. Besides, we swore to be in this together remember?\" Rowan calls out and reaches one hand to the middle.\n\n\n\"Together,\" you exclaim and grab his hand like you would want to arm wrestle him.\n\n\n\"Together,\" Isolda adds with a smile before laying her hand on top of your fists.", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "The left Path", "result": "Let's try the left one,\" you decide and head over to the opening in the wall. Your friends following behind closely as you carefully tread forward.\n\n\nThe path leads you down a narrow stone corridor. The walls, the floor, and even the ceiling seem to be made from the same stone blocks. A few of them show slight cracks but other than that there are no signs of aging in this place. As you keep moving the corridor becomes slightly wider and the walls before you are now intersected with vertical slits that seem to be made from iron. You slow down a little with your free hand on the hilt of your sword, ready to face any upcoming enemy. You keep your gaze focused on the front nearly overhearing the sound of stone grinding on stone. Purely by reflex, you take a step back just in time to dodge a blade swinging like an axe from the slit to your left and then vanishing in the one to your right. After a heartbeat it reappears from the left, seemingly circling now.\n\n\n\"Shit that was close!\" You exclaim with a slight panic of just having avoided near death.\n\n\n\"Was indeed, and now this thing just keeps swinging and blocking the way,\" Rowan grumbles annoyed. As if those were some magical command words, you start hearing more grinding as one blade appears after the other from every slot in the wall.\n\n\n\"Now that's just great. How do we go on here then?\" Isolda asks looking down the corridor.\n\n\n\"Are just axes. Could try and hack away at their handles. Bound to disable them isn't it?\" Rowan suggests with a shrug while leaning his crossbow against the wall and pulling his handaxe from his hip.\n\n\n\"Destroy them? Are you mad? We should not go close to them and remain there. I suggest we try to time it one at a time. There is enough space between them to stay for a while before proceeding,\" Isolda claims with a face lost in thought.\n\n\nAgain you are left with a decision about how to move on. Funny how you became the leader of those two when you left Barthville.", "action_results": [{"action": "Destroying the blades", "result": "As you watch the blades swinging left and right at different intervals, you also notice something else. The walls in between the blades sometimes have other, smaller metal openings. You recon if you stay in the spaces between the blades to long something will shoot out of there. \"Have you noticed those?\" you ask your friends while pointing out the opening in the walls.\n\n\n\"Shit. No I haven't till now. Guess that means running through won't work,\" Isolda admits.\n\n\n\"Guess my plan does not sound all that bad doesn't it elf?\" Rowan states proudly while smirking at Isolda. Isolda on the other hand just rolls her eyes at the cocky dwarf.\n\n\nYou pull your sword and step closer to the first blade, waiting for it to swing by. As you feel safe with knowing the rhythm of how it swings, you start hacking away at the blade trap. Rowan soon joins in with his hand axe and you both keep hacking at it. It takes you several minutes before the blade gets hacked loose and clatters to the floor. Only some part of the wooden stump still swings by, but short enough to pass by over your heads if you duck a little.\n\n\nAfter repeating this tedious process on several blades you reach the first place where there is a opening in between them. Using one of the destroyed blades to prod the ground you find a stone that gives way slightly. After a sound of metal scraping on metal a spear at about shoulder height stabs out of the wall and pierces into the one on the other side, again confirming your first thought.\n\n\nKnowing about the full extend of the traps now, you hack off the rest of the blades and avoid the pressure plate stones till you reach the door on the end of the corridor. With enough space to not be in reach of the spears, or swinging parts of wood that previously had the blades attached to them, you and Rowan sink to the floor exhausted.\n\n\n\"Was ... was quite some work eh?\" Rowan wheezes out between taking two breaths. You silently nod and take the flask of water Isolda hands to you to take a long sip.\n\n\n\"I guess we should take some time and rest. Who knows what's in this next room? You will need your strength,\" she says. \"And yes Rowan I do have to admit your idea was good,\" she continues interrupting Rowan who was about to say something.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "After taking your time to catch your breath, you stand up an examine the door to make sure there aren't any traps on it. After confirming it to be safe, you open up the door to the next room.\n\n\nBehind the door is a new corridor splitting off into two directions. You send one questioning look to your friends. Isolda's head suddenly turns to the left, \"Can you hear that?\"\n\n\n\"Hear what exactly, Isolda?\" you ask her kind of dumbfounded.\n\n\nShe looks at you and seems irritated, \"It sounds like music coming from that direction,\" She points down the corridor to the left.\n\n\n\"Music? Sure someones down there playing the lute,\" Rowan snorts with sarcasm.\n\n\nIsolda looks like she is quite serious about it so you sigh and start to head down that way. After a few steps, you turn your head, \"Are you two coming with me or not?\" They look at each other and then follow you down the corridor with their weapons ready to fight. The further you move forward the louder the eerie music becomes, now clearly heard by everyone.\n\n\nThe corridor leads to a huge circular room. There are rows of seats in a semicircle lined up towards the far end of the room. Some skeletons are sitting on them in a few places, or better said laying on the ground around some places. On the other side of the room you see a stage set up. Huge and heavy looking purple curtains hang from the ceiling high above, covering up most of it. Right in the middle though a single figure sits in front of what looks like an organ made from a strange white material and plays the haunting music. Only a few wax candles that flicker with purple flames are providing light to the room.\n\n\n\"The hell is this room?\" Rowan asks and looks at you both. You simply shrug and start approaching the stage.\n\n\n\"Be careful!\" Isolda screams as you start to hear the figure cackle.\n\n\nThen a old and withered sounding voice echoes through the room, \"Who is alive there in the realm of the dead?\" The figure turns around i's head and looks right at you. \"Ah! Another one for my collection. Hahahahaha,\" The skeleton man starts laughing maniacally and starts playing faster. The curtains blow open wider and some purple mist escapes from the pipes of the organ.\n\n\n\"What's going on?\" Isolda screams as the skeletons touched by the mist start to reassemble themselves. They draw various weapons out from their ribcage, reaching from swords and axes to some rusted spear tips and start advancing at the three of you.\n\n\nYou pull your sword starting to slash at every enemy coming into reach.  Rowan instantly starts firing his crossbow and reloading it as fast as he can, while Isolda gets behind you to swing her staff at them while muttering her protective spells. The skeleton at the organ cackles again. \"Let's see how you keep up with this rhythm.\" He starts playing faster and faster, and the bones of the skeletons you have slain start forming something else. Something much bigger. \n\n\n\"We need to stop the music!\" Rowan shouts while firing two crossbow bolts into the bone monstrosity forming in front of him.   ", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack the organ", "result": "You rush up the stage with your sword drawn trying to reach the organ in the middle. As you reach it you notice the hands of the organ player being shrouded in the same kind of purple mist and hesitate to attack for a second. If the organ is what contains the magic, maybe attacking it will prove more efficient than attacking the one playing it.\n\n\nYou hear Rowan screaming in agony behind you and without thinking twice you slash your sword downwards at the organ. The false tune breaks the rhythm and then skeleton man screams out, \"What the heck are you doing!? You are ruining my song!\" Looking back you see Rowan crumpled to the ground but the bone creature stumbles and parts fall out of it.\n\n\nSeeing that Isolda is already on her way to try and save Rowan you turn again and start hacking at the organ with your blade. As you do so, more and more false tunes ring out, and the organ's keys begin to crack more and more. Every time you hit it the skeleton man curses you and desperately tries to find a way to keep playing. With a roar of fury you swing down at the organ and it breaks the keyboard in half. \"NO! Why? How can I play now? How can I further my collection?\" the man screams standing up from his broken instrument.\n\n\nYou notice the purple mist dissipate and with a scream of victory you behead the organ player. Afterwards the room is silent. You look around noticing Isolda still leaning over the crumpled form of Rowan. You hastly make your way over to them.\n\n\n\"It does not look good. I think his spine is shattered in several places and he does not stop bleeding. I'm afraid I can't help him,\" Isolda states and starts sobbing.\n\n\nRowan suddenly clasps her hand, \"Bah, stop worrying about it Isolda. You did your best. Maybe it was just my time to go\" He starts coughing up blood and then wipes his mouth. \"Will miss to argue with you though. Has always been fun to have someone not back down from me,\" he then turns his head to look at you. \"Take good care of Isolda you hear me?\" He gives you a weak punch to the chest.\n\n\nYou take his arm in a grip like your arm wrestling and look at him with a smile, \"Been a pleasure to adventure with you. You stubborn bastard.\"\n\n\n\"It was indeed,\" Rowan speaks weakly and sinks back onto the ground closing his eyes. \"It was indeed.\"\n\n\nAfter a moment of just kneeling beside your fallen comrade you slowly stand up and start lifting his body. For someone his size it's quite heavy. You slowly carry it out to the fork in the path and lay him down. Then you sit beside him and stay silent for a moment.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Talk", "result": "After double checking the area to be safe, you lean back against the wall and slowly sink down towards the ground besides Isolda. With a sad expression, you stare at the body of Rowan laying on the dirty ground and leaning halfway against the wall. Isolda is sitting there in silence. Her knees are drawn towards her chest, and she is staring towards the floor.\n\n\nAfter a silence that seemed to last forever, Isolda starts to speak in a near whisper, clearly trying to hold back her tears, \"I cannot believe that Rowan is dead. I mean he was a stubborn idiot but still...\" her voice trails off.\n\n\nA small smile creeps onto your face. \"I never took the both of you to be best friends. I mean, with all the arguing you did.\"\n\n\n\"He always liked doing that. To be honest, I think he was appreciating me giving some backtalk towards him. Have you ever noticed that nearly no one did that?\" she asks, looking at you with small tears forming in her eyes but also the hint of a smile on her lips.\n\n\nIt breaks your heart to see her this sad. She seems to be fonder of Rowan than you ever imagined. People always show their real colors in the face of a grave situation. Maybe you could succeed in cheering her up. You are the one that lead them here though. So, isn't it basically your fault he died?", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to comfort her", "result": "You look at Isolda, for a moment noticing the small tears that are forming in her eyes. \"Have I ever told you how I even met Rowan?\" you ask with a smile, hoping to cheer her up with a story from the past.\n\n\nShe sniffs once before turning to face towards you, \"No. No, you haven't.\" With a smile you beckon her over to sit right beside you and begin telling the tale.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nIt was an ordinary day in Barthville. On your way to school, you notice a very small woman walking towards the building. Behind her walks an equally stocky and small child. The woman looks up and sees you walking in the same direction. Friendly as you are, you give a little wave towards her. Upon seeing this, she waves back and keeps walking.\n\n\nAs you enter class and sit down, your teacher, Mr. Grandolf, steps in and starts addressing the class, \"Today we greet a new member of our class. He is new in town with his mother and I want you to be nice, you hear me?\" As he finished, the stocky boy walks in and looks around with a curious but also hostile expression. \"Why don't you introduce yourself, boy?\" Mr Grandolf suggests.\n\n\nThe boy gives him a curious look and replies shortly, \"Rowan.\" Afterwards, he walks over to a free seat and sits down.\n\n\nSchool took long enough to end, and afterwards you are on your way towards home. As you leave the building, you see Tristan standing before you with a smug smile, \"Where do you think you're going?\"\n\n\n\"Home?\" you reply wearily and try to push past.\n\n\nTristan wants his money though and goes to push you to the floor. Rowan grabs his arm though and holds it for a moment. \"He owe you money?\" he asks Tristan grimly.\n\n\n\"Why does that concern you?\" Tristan exclaims while trying to shake Rowan off. Rowan just holds on and seems to press Tristan's arm harder which ends with him screaming for mercy.\n\n\n\"Should bully someone as strong as you, if you wanna be a man,\" Rowan replies before giving Tristan a hard shove so he lands on the ground.\n\n\n\"You should not get into trouble for my sake,\" you explain with an apologetic look on your face.\n\n\n\"Nonsense. Been the only one that didn't look at me mum with a scowl on the face. You're nice. Will be your friend,\" Rowan replies with a smile and holds out his hand. You shake it and return a smile of your own.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\"He was always more caring than people thought,\" Isolda says with a smile on her face but tears running down her cheeks.\n\n\n\"He was indeed,\" you reply and smile slightly. \"We should take a rest so we can go on with this damn pyramid. Who knows, maybe we can pay for getting him back,\" you suggest. Isolda nods and lets herself lean against the wall. With a last look at the body of your dead friend, you close your eyes to sleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "Carry on with Isolda", "result": "You awake as something starts moving beside you. You open your eyes and wake with a start as you stare right into Isolda's eyes. You both look at each other and start to blush. She then quickly gets up and says, \"So umm... let's carry on, I'd say.\" Your eyes follow her as she starts moving towards her pack laying on the ground, to grab her rations.\n\n\nAfter you and Isolda have eaten some of your rations, you make sure Rowan's body is in a safe place, so you may pick it up on your return. You then follow down the path until you find a split in the path again. The corridor is just a simple sandstone tunnel built with a few wall torches to light the path. The floor and some stones of the wall are already slightly cracked, and a few cobwebs are in the corners of the ceiling. At one point, the corridor becomes slightly wider and you see a silver-looking door with an hourglass etched into it. On the opposing side of the corridor, you see a stairway leading downwards deeper into the pyramid.\n\n\n\"Well that looks kinda impressive,\" Isolda remarks. \"Should we try to go through?\n\n\n\"Sure, why not. But check if you can find traps before trying to open it,\" you reply while moving closer to have a look. The door itself looks quite heavy and is most likely solid metal. You recon it alone would be likely worth more than anything else in this whole dungeon. Moving the door is out of the question though, since it's far too heavy. After checking for every kind of trap you can think of, twice to be absolutely sure, Isolda and you both take a step back. You look at her for a moment and shrug. \"Here goes nothing.\"\n\n\nYou slowly stretch out your hand, reaching for the door's handle. Carefully, you touch it and get a good grip. Then, you push and pull realizing it is locked.\n\n\n\"That was very anticlimactic,\" Isolda states as she raises her shoulders in a shrug.\n\n\n\"I guess we will have to try the staircase then,\" you remark and slowly start to descend. Every few steps, you check for traps just to find nothing.\n\n\nThe simple stone corridor leads you down deeper and deeper, until you reach a point where two doors split off the floor into two sections. Between the two doors is an elaborate painting of a bow and arrow. Above the left door is a skull carved into the wall. The door on the right brandishes what looks like a raindrop.\n\n\n\"Which way should we go now?\" Isolda asks you. You take a moment to think about it.", "action_results": [{"action": "The \"Skull\" door", "result": "\"Let's take that one,\" you say while pointing at the door with the skull above it.\n\n\nIsolda scowls while looking at the skull and says, \" It does not seem inviting.\"\n\n\nYou chuckle, \"Never took you for a woman to be scared by architecture.\"\n\n\n\"I'm not scared. Just careful. Do you remember Rowan just died back there?\" she claims.\n\n\nYour look becomes distant and you harshly clench your fists. \"No, Isolda. I can never forget that I lead him to his demise,\" you reply to her with anger and sadness in your voice. How could you ever forget that fact? You then feel a gentle hand resting on your shoulder as Isolda tries to comfort you.\n\n\nLike before, you start checking the door for traps of any kind. Isolda soon joins in to make sure. Again, you do not notice a trap on the door itself and afterwards, slowly open it to reveal the room behind.\n\n\nThe room behind the door is decorated with banners showing some ancient family crest. It depicts an eagle with spread wings that reach for the sun, trying to catch it. The crest itself is silver on a fiery orange background. The borders of the banner are trimmed with a silver thread. The floor of the room no longer is manufactured from sandstone, but from solid marble. Four massive hourglasses act like columns to support the golden-colored roof with the picture of a grand temple-like structure painted on it.\n\n\nBetween the pillars, a sarcophagus is placed on a slightly raised platform. The trunk of it looks like it has been carved from a solid block of marble. The lid is covered in golden and silver decorations, and carved to resemble a man with crossed arms and his body wrapped into wings that protrude from his own back. His face is covered by a beautiful and elaborate looking mask that resembles a hawk's face, but with a sun dial decorating the top of it, and four eyes instead of two.\n\n\nJust as you stop to take in the massive room, the door behind you slams shut and metal bars rise from the ground to prevent reopening. The torches on the walls light up with bright orange flames, and you see the four pillars start to fill with sand from above. The sarcophagus starts to rise and shift from the ground into an upright position. Then, the lid swings open, and a man steps out of it. His body is covered in bandages, and golden armor is clad around his body. The cape that falls off his shoulders is separated into different ribbons, making it look like wings. His head is dressed in the same mask that the sarcophagus depicted but behind the eyes burns a bright orange light.  He slowly looks around the room before screaming out a sound that resembles that of an eagle and raises a scepter that lights up with the same orange light.\n\n\nYour reflexes spring to action immediately, and you dodge to the side. You see Isolda do the same out of the corner of your eye, and a blast of orange flame hits the spot the both of you were standing on before. Circling one of the pillars, you draw your sword, taking a quick swing at the creature's back. The blade bounces off his armor and does not even leave a dent. The creature quickly turns around and swings his scepter at you. As the orange flame passes, you feel the immense heat emanating from it. Before he can take a second swing, he gets hit by a medium sized fireball square in the back, which is enough time for you to dodge around the pillar again.\n\n\n\"He seems like he can be wounded by fire quite well! Just like those mummies!\" you hear Isolda scream. \"Help me get closer; I have an idea!\"\n\n\nWithout thinking further about it, you dive in again and swing your sword at him desperately, trying to create an opening. You also hear Isolda starting to chant her spell and try to keep him focused on you.  Unfortunately, the creature also hears her quite clearly and, with a few expertly executed attacks, sends you sprawling to the floor with your sword clattering along the ground. In horror, you watch as it sprints over and slashes one claw at Isolda. For a split second, you see her eyes shift towards you. Her lips forming words you can not make out, but then you see her breaking her own spell which results in a huge explosion. The shockwave sends her and the creature flying in different directions and slamming into the walls. You stand in shock for a second as you see the creature stirring. A moment later, it lays still on the ground, you are standing beside it with your dagger slammed into its neck.\n\n\nYou quickly run over to Isolda to check her vitals. Her pulse is becoming weaker by the second, and you don't get any reaction from her body.

I simply know when your birthday is. Also, it's not like there is anywhere else to actually celebrate in this shitty little town,\" she replies with a smile while leaning onto the fence.\n\n\n\"Guess I'm not really into celebrating stuff like that. It's not like I achieved something that's worthy of celebrating,\" you shrug.\n\n\n\"Well, you did survive another year of Rowan's friendship.

Your eyes follow the red and gold carpet that leads from the entrance towards the opposite wall. The most prominent thing though is the massive, ornate steel and gold door on the other side of the room.\n\n\n\"Finally!\" you exclaim nearly shouting it into the room before you. After nearly three days of walking and crawling through dark tunnels you reached the door to the treasure chamber at last. Just thinking back to all the skeletons and mummies you had to hack down with your trusty old sword makes your skin crawl. \n\n\nThere were a few times you nearly were killed by those monsters. You are glad you were clever enough not to fall victim to one of those poisoned arrow traps or the swinging blades. Something Rowan and Isolda were not successful in sadly.\n\n\nBut that does not matter to you now because you finally reached the door to unknown riches and magical artifacts that was buried deep within this god forsaken tomb. If you can get to that none of it will matter since you can pay to bring them back.\n\n\n\"Would you mind not to shout so much? I was resting quite nicely here,\" someone suddenly speaks from your right side. With reflexes quick as lightning you turn towards it, draw your sword and stand, ready.

In fact, why risk a fight when it can be solved in another way?\n\n\n\"Very well,\" you answer and put your sword back into the sheath hanging at your side, still letting your hand rest on the handle though.\n\n\nShe smiles at you, \"Wise choice, human.\" With those words she rises and what was prior hidden from your view now shows as she rises and walks around the rocks that obstructed your vision earlier.

Just the face and the neck seem to be those of a human. \n\n\n\"From your startled expression I can tell you never saw a sphinx before,\" she addresses you again.\n\n\n\"Can not say I have,\" you answer cautiously. Your gaze is fixed to her paws watching out for the slightest movement.\n\n\nShe chuckles slightly, \"If I did want to kill you you would not stand here still. So no reason to be nervous around me.

Right as she lands she already starts turning around slashing at you with one massive clawed paw. This time a little to slow with raising your sword to deflect the blow she manages to hit your chest, drawing her five claws over it, leaving a deep bleeding wound.\n\n\nThe force of the blow sends you to the floor, and again you roll to the side purely by instinct and just fast enough to escape her downwards slash. Before you can stand however her tail swings at you hitting you with what seems to be a a golden, spiked ring that can be used like a club. The spikes sink deeply into your flesh, and you let loose a agonized scream echoing from the walls. With swift moves she puts her paws down on your legs and arms, her claws sinking in mercilessly.

Seemingly, they depict the history of an old Civilization. Could also be some strange religion when you look at some of them.\n\n\nThey seem to show a bird of prey that is huge enough to cover the sun. You see people despairing about the sun being blocked and cowering on the floor in the shadows. After that you see a man holding a scepter towards the sky that seems to shoot a blinding light towards the sky to chase away the bird. In the next picture the people start to kneel before the man and worship him as some kind of king or god.\n\n\n\"This is absolutely fascinating. Just look at all this detail,\" Isolda says staring wide eyed at the pictures while walking along the corridor.\n\n\n\"Yeah I guess you are right,\" you reply and notice there are some very small openings in the pictures. Before you can think about the deeper meaning you see Isolda walking ahead and follow her. It is then that you hear the grinding of stone on stone and see Isolda panicking.\n\n\n\"It's some kind of trap!\" she screams while running towards the exit. You start chasing as you see the door close and being blocked by iron bars protruding from the ground. You and Isolda both turn tails and run towards the other side. Then darts start to shoot from the pictures behind you like a slowly approaching wall. You look back to Isolda running behind you as you see a huge crossbow folding itself free from the ceiling with two arrows already aimed in your direction. Without thinking twice you turn around and block their way to Isolda with your body while ordering her to duck. She manages to throw herself to the ground. You are not that lucky as both arrows bury themselves in your ribcage and throw you to the ground.\n\n\n\"No!\" Isolda screams as she runs towards you kneeling down to inspect the wound. \"No no no. It seems those are poisoned.\"\n\n\n\"It's fine, Isolda.

But now, her look isn't caring. It's a look of determination, honesty, and anger. \"It is not your fault, you hear me?! Rowan and I could have both said no to this ordeal, but we didn't.

Rowan is dead that's all I achieved,\" you reply with a defeated voice. \"You would be better off without me,\" you remark while freeing yourself from her grip.\n\n\n\"Better off without you?!\" , you turn your head, surprised.

His head is already bleeding from where one of the thrown plates must have hit him and his nose is also bleeding.\n\n\n\"Damn elven bitch.

In the wall between the blades is a round, metal opening. From this opening suddenly a spear starts stabbing towards you.\n\n\nWhat happens next seems to happen in slow motion to you.

She seems to be crying.\n\n\nYou announce your presence by clearing your throat and step into the meadow. The girl shrieks and quickly stands up to turn around.

Looking closer you also notice you have seen her before. She and her parents came into town just recently.\n\n\n\"Yeah I do know Tristan. He is a massive jerk. Always wants to beat me up and steal my money,\" You state hoping for her to loosen up.\n\n\n\"If it was just that I would not even mind him. I would give him the money.

You then follow down the path until you find a split in the path again. The corridor is just a simple sandstone tunnel built with a few wall torches to light the path. The floor and some stones of the wall are already slightly cracked, and a few cobwebs are in the corners of the ceiling. At one point, the corridor becomes slightly wider and you see a silver-looking door with an hourglass etched into it.

After checking for every kind of trap you can think of, twice to be absolutely sure, Rowan and you both take a step back.

Every few steps, you check for traps just to find nothing.\n\n\nThe simple stone corridor leads you down deeper and deeper, until you reach a point where two doors split up the floor into two sections. Between the two doors is an elaborate painting of a bow and arrow. Above the left door is a skull carved into the wall.

I can never forget that I lead her to her demise,\" you reply to him with anger and sadness in your voice. How could you ever forget that fact? You then feel a gentle clap on your back as Rowan tries to comfort you.\n\n\nLike before, you start checking the door for traps of any kind. Rowan soon joins in to make sure. Again, you do not notice a trap on the door itself and afterwards, slowly open it to reveal the room behind.\n\n\nThe room behind the door is decorated with banners showing some ancient family crest. It depicts an eagle with spread wings that reach for the sun like trying to catch it. The crest itself is silver on a fiery orange background. The borders of the banner trimmed with silver thread. The floor of the room no longer is manufactured from sandstone but from solid marble. Four massive hourglasses act like columns to support the golden-colored roof with the picture of a grand temple-like structure painted on it.\n\n\nBetween the pillars, a sarcophagus is placed on a slightly raised platform. The trunk of it looks like it has been carved from a solid block of marble. The lid is covered in golden and silver decorations, and carved to resemble a man with crossed arms and his body wrapped into wings that protrude from his own back. His face is covered by a beautiful and elaborate looking mask that resembles a hawk's face, but with a sun dial decorating the top of it, and four eyes instead of two.\n\n\nJust as you stop to take in the massive room, the door behind you slams shut and metal bars rise from the ground to prevent reopening. The torches on the walls light up with bright orange flames, and you see the four pillars start to fill with sand from above. The sarcophagus starts to rise and shift from the ground into an upright position. Then, the lid swings open, and a man steps out of it. His body is covered in bandages, and golden armor is clad around his body. The cape that falls off his shoulders is separated into different ribbons, making it look like wings. His head is dressed in the same mask that the sarcophagus depicts but behind the eyes burns a bright orange light.  He slowly looks around the room before screaming out a sound that resembles that of an eagle and raises a scepter that lights up with the same orange light.\n\n\nYour reflexes spring into action and you combat roll to the side. Rowan does the same in the opposite direction and just as he rounds the pillar a bright orange flame hits the spot he was standing at before. You pull your sword from the scabbard and run around the corner slashing it at your foes back, but it simply bounces of his armor. The man turns and swings his staff at you. You just barely avoid the direct hit, but as you feel it pass your face the intense head it gives of is enough to make you sweat. Getting hit by it would result in a heavy burn. The sound of Rowan's crossbow can be heard and a bolt hits the enemies back bouncing of his armor. Using that as a distraction you run a few steps back and raise your sword in a defensive stance. \n\n\nThe man comes at you and swings his scepter again, which you block before dodging the second blow. The next series of bolts hitting him make him stagger a bit but still don't get past his armor. You start attacking yourself by hacking at different parts of his body. The mummy barely avoids them letting them bounce of his armor. Only as you go to strike his head he raises the scepter to interrupt your blow which gives you an idea.\n\n\nYou combat roll again out of his way and start shouting, \"I will give you an opportunity, Rowan. Just follow my lead!\" With that being all you say you run in again trying to dodge all his attacks while focusing yours on his arms. The first few he just takes and lets the armor protect him, but after a few tries you finally manage to hit his scepter just right to disarm the creature. without thinking twice you throw away your sword and grab onto his helmet. The mummy grabs you and tries to shake you off. After a short wrestling match you finally manage to pull of his helmet. Just as you do the mummy uses one of his claws to impale you through the stomach. For a moment you stand there with his hand inside you. He then retracts it and goes to grab for his mask. A dull sound can be heard as three heavy looking bolts fire into the creatures head in quick succession, making him stumble back and fall to the floor.\n\n\nYou also topple over and get caught by Rowan who holds you in his arms. \"Will be fine mate. Don't worry. It will be fine,\" he stutters while looking at the deep hole in your body. You cough up blood and then give him a weak smile while holding your hand up so he can grab it like you always did.\n\n\n\"No worries mate. I will be waiting for you to join me and Isolda again,\" you state as your vision begins to become clouded. You close your eyes and the last thing you hear is Rowan's voice.\n\n\n\"Better be waiting for a long time I hope.\"\n\n\nThen darkness engulfs you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "The \"Raindrop\" door", "result": "\"Let's take that one,\" you say while pointing at the door with the raindrop above it.\n\n\n\"Little water will not hurt this place,\" Rowan remarks as you both walk up to the door. You again begin to carefully search for traps on the door itself, Rowan double checking every place you already searched to be sure there are none, but again you find nothing. You stand there looking at the door for a moment before shrugging and reaching out for the door handle. Very slowly you open the door just to find yourself in a much more fancy looking corridor.\n\n\nThe walls are made form pure white marble while the ceiling and floor seem to be made of a much darker stone. a very silky looking red carpet lines the floor. The walls are lit by candleholders that are burning with a bright red flame and covered in Paintings done directly onto the wall. Seemingly they depict the history of an old Civilization. Could also be some strange religion when you look at some of them.\n\n\nThey seem to show a bird of prey that is huge enough to cover the sun. You see people despairing about the sun being blocked and cowering on the floor in the shadows. After that you see a man holding a scepter towards the sky that seems to shoot a blinding light towards the sky to chase away the bird. In the next picture the people start to kneel before the man and worship him as some kind of king or god.\n\n\nYou are very intrigued by the pictures and while looking at them you notice small openings scattered all throughout them. Just as you want to touch one you hear Rowan shout, \"Come on will ya?\" as he marches towards the other side of the corridor.\n\n\n\"Something is off about those pictures I think,\" you start speaking as you walk along the corridor.\n\n\n\"Bah. Just fancy old paint on a wall. Nothing to be scared of,\" he grumbles and keeps marching. You walk along with a shrug and from time to time glance at the pictures. At that moment you feel one of the stones beneath you give way and the slight grinding of stone on stone.  Suddenly the door behind you slams shut and metal bars shoot from the ground  to block it. You look behind you in shock when you see small darts starting to shoot from the walls.\n\n\nQuickly you start to run with Rowan following on your heels as you try to avoid the darts flying from left to right. You see the corridor end in a heavy wooden door and your face lights up. \"We will make it, Rowan!\" you shout with joy.\n\n\nThen you feel him tackling you from behind while screaming to duck at the top of his lungs. You fall prone towards the floor with him above you. After a few moments of you laying there motionless the darts stop flying. He struggles to get off of you and when he does he immediately sinks to one knee. It is just now that you see two bigger arrows protruding from his back. You look back towards the door you came from to see what seems to be a crossbow that folded out of the ceiling pointing towards your direction.\n\n\n\"Fuck! Rowan you idiot you should have just dived out of the way!\" you shout angrily.\n\n\n\"To let you get shot? Not gonna happen mate,\" he grunts while trying to get back on his feet. He staggers for a moment and then falls back to the ground. His hands are shaking heavily. You quickly get over to him and see some thick clear liquid dropping from the arrows and the flesh around his wound turning to a black color.\n\n\n\"Damn I think those are poisoned,\" you state and start to carefully pull them out of Rowan's back.\n\n\n\"Guess that's it for me then mate,\" he grunts and moves over to the wall leaning back against it.\n\n\n\"You should not have sacrificed yourself for me old friend,\" you say with a smile while kneeling before him.\n\n\nHe gives you a grin and raises his hand like you always did for your handshake, \"It was worth dying for you.\"\n\n\nYou give him a weak smile back and grab his hand. You see him close his eyes and hear his breath getting weaker and weaker before his hand slumps down.\n\n\n\"I truly hope it was old friend,\" you mutter before standing up to walk the rest of the corridor.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fond Memories", "result": "Again the sound of metal hitting hard against wood. \"Are getting quicker, but not quick enough right now,\" Rowan remarks while sidestepping your next swing. Quickly you swing again this time kicking at his foot the same time making him stumble and fall. You point the end of your dulled training sword at his throat.\n\n\n\"Still to slow now?\" you say with a smug smile in a mocking tone. Rowan just grins and raises his hand. You grab it with yours and pull him back to his feet.\n\n\n\"Plans for tonight already?\" He asks while gathering up the shield for the training your doing and walking back towards his mothers smithy.\n\n\n\"Not really, Rowan. I mean its not like today is all that special,\" you remark while hanging the training sword back onto the rack.\n\n\n\"What do ya mean by that? Is your birthday mate. And your eighteenth birthday at that,\" he nearly shouts seemingly disappointed.\n\n\n\"This is one small shit hole of a town, Rowan. It's not like there is anywhere to go but the local pub,\" you state casually while grabbing for the bucket of water to take a drink from it. \"Besides my father probably wants me to help him with the farm work,\" you add with a slight frown.\n\n\n\"You'll just miss another chance with Isolda if you just keep working the damn fields mate,\" He says while elbowing you slightly, making you cough from the water.\n\n\n\"I have got no idea what you are talking about,\" you reply while shoving the water bucket to him showering him partly.\n\n\n\"Sure,\" Rowan rolls his eyes and gives you a smile. \"Anyways my ma and I have been working on something we wanna give ya,\" he continues and walks into the smithy beckoning you to follow. Inside he tells you to wait and goes to fetch his mum. They come back with Rowan holding a small chest. His mother instantly going in to hug you.\n\n\n\"Oh deary. Let me congratulate you boy,\" she says with the brightest smile on her face. \"You're finally a man now.\"\n\n\nRowan snickers and you give his mum a few gentle pads on the back, \"Thanks miss Firehand.\"\n\n\n\"We worked hard on this one,\" Rowan continues and hands you the chest. As you open it you see it holds a dagger in a dark brown leather scabbard. The handle is made from what looks like brass and has a dragons head for a pommel. As you pull it out you notice the blade to be shining polished steel with your name etched into one side and Rowan's etched into the other.\n\n\n\"Thank you so much. Both of you,\" You reply and pull both of them into a hug. \"This is something I will hold dearly for all my life.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nYou reach the end of the corridor and take a last look back at your friends body before walking through the door. Your mind is set. No matter what is in that vault, if you can afford it you will bring them both back. Screw the money. What would you do with it alone?\n\n\nWith that new mindset, you walk through a rather simple sandstone corridor, again, until you see light shining around the corner at the end.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Blame yourself for Isolda's death", "result": "You sink your head, with a sigh. It nearly sounds like a whimper. \"It's all my fault,\" you state simply.\n\n\nRowan's gaze wanders towards you, \"What the bloody hell are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" you ask with an ironic chuckle. \"I was the one to go with her decision. It was my leadership that ended in her death. If I just had listened to you earlier. If I just never brought you to this dungeon.\" your voice trails of.\n\n\n\"Oh no, don't even start like that,\" Rowan begins to speak. You notice his voice becoming slightly agitated. \"Really think she would have gone with you if she never wanted to? Knew it was dangerous, but it was a hope. Since we left Barthville we followed your leadership. Are our friend and we trust you, yes, but if we ever thought your decision was a bad idea we would never have gone with you. Hell, we wanted to be adventurers and yet never found a way to be before you showed us to this bloody pyramid.\"\n\n\nYou stare at Rowan. His jaw is set and his eyes directly staring into yours. His nostrils slightly flaying with every breath he takes. It's the first time you have ever seen him that angry since you were both in Barthville.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\"Come on it's easy. Give me the money and I will be off,\" Tristan says with a mock smile on his face. You are sitting in the dirt before him holding your bleeding nose after he just punched you straight in the face.\n\n\n\"Better not be what I think it is!\" a gruff voice bellows out from behind you.\n\n\n\"Ohh look who is here. The walking tree stump,\" Tristan blurts out nearly laughing.\n\n\n\"Bah, you should leave before I hack you down then,\" Rowan speaks while walking up beside you. You slowly stand up and look down towards your dwarven friend.           \n\n\n\"Still don't know why you never fight back against that asshole. Just cause he's the mayor's son does not mean he's allowed to be a bully\"\n\n\n\"You better watch your tongue dwarf or I'll tell my dad to throw you and your bearded sow of a mother out of the town,\" Tristan blurts out with a smug smile.\n\n\nRowan clenches his fists and stares up at Tristan. His nostrils are flaring and his eyes never blink. The veins on his forehead start becoming more prominent and he speaks with a menacing whisper, \"Did you just say?\"\n\n\n\"Is your beard blocking your ears? I said you should watch your tongue or I let my dad throw you and your bearded sow of a mother..,\" Tristan does not get to finish his sentence before Rowan punches him so hard in the crotch he just crumples to the floor. Tristan seems like he wants to say more but Rowan still isn't finished. He grabs his hair and beats his face in with his fist. After about ten punches that basically destroy Tristan's nose, he lets go, and Tristan falls to the ground sobbing like a little girl.\n\n\nRowan then kneels so his face is close to Tristan's and starts speaking again, \"Better listen carefully for I will only tell you this once. Your dad or his men laying one hand on my mother, or you muttering one ill word against her again, and not only will I break your kneecaps and spine, but I will also make sure you never get to be someone's dad. Understood?\" All Tristan does is a nod in defeat and keeping up his crying.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nYour lips get a small smirk as you look at Rowan and you mutter a small, \"Thanks.\"\n\n\n\"Don't have to thank me for that,\" Rowan answers with a smile. \"Now get some rest we both need it. I take first watch,\" with those words, Rowan reloads his crossbow and rests it on his lap.\n\n\nYou nod and lay down waiting for your turn.", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}, {"action": "The right Path", "result": "\"Let's try the right one,\" you decide and head over to the opening in the wall. Your friends follow close behind as you carefully tread forward.\n\n\nThe path leads to an octagonal chamber with one door leading in and one door leading out on the other side. The sides of the room are covered in sarcophagi, and one more ordinate sarcophagus is standing in the middle of the room. The base of the middle sarcophagus is surrounded by gold and precious jewels as well as some pottery.\n\n\n\"Looks like quite the money there,\" Rowan points out and walks forward.\n\n\n\"Rowan, get back. Who knows if this is a trap or not,\" Isolda explains with concern plastering her face. Her eyes are constantly checking the room.\n\n\n\"She's right, Rowan. Let's at least think about what we do next,\" you join in, letting your hand rest on the grip of your sword.\n\n\nRowan just rolls his eyes but actually begins to scan the room too. As you look around in silence, all of you start to hear some strange chanting coming from the sarcophagus in the middle.\n\n\n\"The heck is that?\" Rowan asks as the lid of the sarcophagus in the middle starts to swing open very slowly. While it opens, strange green energy seems to seep out of it. As the lid is fully opened, the energy hits the sarcophagi on the walls. The lids fall open, and from each one of them, a mummy emerges. The one in the middle is wearing a noble death mask that shows an eyepatch and a face that slightly resembles a hawk.\n\n\n\"Fuck, get in position!\" you scream as you pull your sword and stand in front of your friends. Just like every time you are in combat, Rowan takes his place slightly behind you with the crossbow, ready. Isolda walks behind Rowan and pulls out her staff, the tip glowing with a soft blue colour.\n\n\nThe mummies start to approach, and you begin hacking away. Your sword does not cut through them easily though. Whenever you pull it out of them to strike again, you see sand falling from their bodies.\n\n\n\"Something's not right here!\" you shout while kicking one mummy back against his friend.\n\n\n\"Noticed already. Guess it's the big one doing something!\" Rowan shouts back. Just now, you notice the mummy in the middle has hardly moved. Also, the glow seems to be coming from it rather than the sarcophagus.\n\n\n\"Give me time, and I'll shoot it!\" Rowan screams while firing a bolt through a mummy's head.\n\n\n\"I could try a spell if you want me to. It is not perfect, but it could do the trick!\" Isolda suddenly shouts from the back.\n\n\nBoth sound like solid ideas. Isolda seems to have a little doubt in her spell though, and Rowan is an excellent marksman.", "action_results": [{"action": "Have Rowan shoot it", "result": "You would rather take the safe bet and let Rowan shoot the damn mummy.\n\n\n\"Rowan, go for it!\" you shout. You start to maneuver yourself so you're out of his way, but blocking the mummies from reaching him. Your sword swings downwards on one of their heads, leaving a deep gash in the mummy's scalp that starts to \"bleed\" sand. With another kick, you send it tumbling backwards into a second one standing behind it. You swing your sword to the right just fast enough to block one mummy's claw from hitting you. To your left, another mummy approaches you, ready to attack, but just before it reaches you, it's send flying by a bolt of energy.\n\n\nA slight grin appears on your face, knowing that Isolda has your back as always. You hear footsteps and see Rowan dashing to the side with a cocky smile on his face. \"Got you now, dust brain!\" he shouts, firing one of his heavier bolts straight at the glowing mummy's face. With an audible thud, it hits its target, and the bolt gets stuck in the mask. A slight crack appears. The mummies all freeze for a moment.\n\n\nThen you see Rowan's smile fade from his face as the mummies move again like nothing ever happened. You hear him cursing at the enemies and starting to shoot other mummies again. \"Isolda!\" you scream and return to fighting.\n\n\n\"No worries. I got this,\" comes the reply, and you see her take a step back beginning to cast some spell. As soon as she does, the mummies all turn towards her and ignore you. You run as fast as you can to place yourself in front of Isolda and block the mummies path.\n\n\nYou swing your sword at them and push your body in their way to block their paths as much as you can. One manages to break through your defense. Isolda looks at it with shock but keeps muttering her incantations. Just as the mummy raises its arm and takes a swing, Rowan jumps right into its path. From then on everything seems to happen in slow motion. The claw hits Rowan, blood starts pouring from the wound, Isolda's staff lights up with a bright orange light.\n\n\n\"Duck!\" she screams in a panic and just as you hit the ground, the wave rushes over your head.\n\n\nThe mummies hit by the energy wave immediately light up in flames, their bandages start burning away, and piles of sand are falling out of them. The big Mummy lets out a shriek, sounding like an eagle, and then starts to crumble. As his death mask hits the floor the green energy from him and the sarcophagus fades into nothingness.\n\n\nStill laying on the floor prone and unable to comprehend what just happened, it dawns upon you that Rowan is wounded. You stand up just to see Isolda already kneeling beside him with her hands glowing in a soft green light.\n\n\n\"How does it look?\" you ask running up beside her and also kneeling down.\n\n\nShe does not say a word but just gives you a very concerned look. \"Is alright friends,\" Rowan speaks in a weak and low voice. \"Can already tell I won't make it through this with ya,\" he continues.\n\n\n\"Don't say that just yet Rowan maybe I can...\" Isolda starts but gets interrupted.\n\n\n\"Wasting time on me will not do you both any good,\" Rowan exclaims. He then looks at you with a very determined expression. \"Better make sure to keep an eye on Isolda you hear me.\" After that, he reaches out his hand. Like always, you grab it in a gesture that reminds you of arm wrestling and Isolda places her hand on top. He gives you both a stern nod before closing his eyes.

Maybe Rowan's bolts won't even faze them either. \"Alright, Isolda. Hope this works!\" you shout and start to hack at the mummies between you and her. You dodge one claw and take a swing at the mummy's arm afterwards. Just as you slice down one enemy's front, you hear a thud of a bolt hitting the mummy right behind you, distracting it long enough for you to give it a good kick, to make it stagger back.\n\n\nAs you reach Isolda, who already retreated to the entrance of the chamber, you see her staff lighting up and hear her muttering some kind of incantations. The moment her staff lights up though, the mummy with the mask screams something in a guttural language. On his command, all mummies start to turn towards Isolda. You hear Rowan starting to curse. Suddenly, his bolts fly straight into the enemies closest to Isolda. You ready your sword for the mummies stomping your way.\n\n\nThe first one takes a swipe at you which you quickly dodge and answer with a hit to the face. Quickly turning to your left and ducking you hack at one mummy's knee stopping it from pushing past you towards Isolda. A long claw tears into your armour-plated shoulder giving you a painful bruise. You turn again and see another claw already raised to hit you, but a blot hits the mummy right in the face and makes it stagger back enough for you to kick it away.\n\n\n\"Duck!\" Isolda suddenly screams and without thinking you throw yourself to the ground. Out of the corner of your eye, you see Rowan doing the same. From Isolda's staff, a bright orange light starts to emit in a fast-moving energy wave. The mummies that are hit by the energy wave immediately light ablaze and start to scream in the same guttural language as the leader. The bandages burn away quickly and leave behind just some piles of sand.\n\n\nThe masked mummy does not stand a chance either, burning and screaming till all that remains is a pile of sand with a mask laying on top. You blink a few times to adjust your eyes to the normal light in the room again and see Isolda standing above you with a smile and her hand reaching out to help you up.\n\n\n\"By Haldrin's beard,\" Rowan exclaims. \"I knew you could do that I would never have started arguing with you.\"\n\n\n\"Well now you know,\" Isolda says with a weak smile. \"Takes a ton of concentration and magical energy though. So don't expect the same thing next time.\"\n\n\n\"Hopefully we will not need that again, Isolda,\" You tell her while resting your hand on her shoulder. You then take a look around seeing Rowan still eyeing up that pile of treasure around the central sarcophagus. \"I guess it is fine to take that stuff now you know,\" giving him your okay.\n\n\nRowan takes a look at you and then at the treasure. He slowly approaches it and stops right in front of it. With a last wary glance, he takes one of the necklaces and aims his crossbow at the sarcophagus at the same time. Nothing happens. \"Think that means it's safe to take this stuff and go on then,\" Rowan says with a smile and soon all three of you start stuffing your pockets with the gold and the trinkets in the room.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "Leaving the room you see a corridor leading into two different directions.

She simply shrugs, \"Might as well try it. I mean if it looks dangerous we can always return this way right?\"\n\n\n\"Alright, Rowan. Lead the way,\" you state with a shrug and start heading down the corridor. At the end of the corridor, you find a door not closed fully. You three all pull out your weapons ready to engage into combat if you should need to. You enter the room first with Isolda following close behind. Rowan still is not through the doorway while you look around the room. Before you is just an empty room with a small recession in the floor in the middle. On the opposite wall is a simple wooden chest.\n\n\n\"This looks to simple to be real,\" Isolda states, stepping up beside you.
