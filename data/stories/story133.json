The warmth of the school halls and brightness from artificial lighting seem much more inviting.\n\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019re out here, because they\u2019re inside. You deemed the pool too crowded and the dorms too wild. On the average dreary Saturday, half the boys receive warnings while a couple dozen are punished, not that it really matters. As long as their parents send in enough money, the troublemakers stay.\n\nYou pick up a rock from the path. You toss it up and catch it a few times. Then, you hurl the rock into the woods. It soars until it makes a resounding thunk against a limb. A bird flies away chirping out a warning, so you cringe. \u201cSorry,\u201d you say under your breath. Of course, the bird doesn\u2019t hear it, but it makes you feel a little better.\n\nThe wind gusts again and you shiver, though it\u2019s not as bad as last time. You should\u2019ve brought your hat, but you were in a rush to get out here. No one strolls through the woods despite the nice scenery and rock path. You shrug at people\u2019s indifference towards plain beauty, trees on a frigid winter day.\n\nYou cross your arms until the wind dies down. In this moment, you hear nothing. No fellow classmates chattering about whatnot, no teachers lecturing about the lessons, and no Cerise annoying you for fun.\n\nThen, the silence ends with a faint, feminine whimper. You strain your ears to find the source. Who\u2019d be out here anyway? You follow the sound off the path and to a small grove of pines. Looking around, you don\u2019t see anyone, just the green needles, grey sky, and brown ground covered in leaves. You step on a twig, and the whimpering stops.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d you ask. \u201cIs everything alright? Are you hurt?\u201d\n\nNo one responds. Was the sound only the wind? It couldn\u2019t be. Someone was crying.\n\nYou walk around the clearing and check behind the trees. Peering behind a large pine tree, you see flowing red hair. You gulp and kneel in front of the girl.

You\u2019re transported to a happy world, but this time you share it with Cerise. The music waltzes on by as you both walk on a green hill. The sun warms your skin. You stop by a creek and take of your shoes. She cools off her feet in the murmuring waters with you.\n\nThen, the music stops. The crowd claps. You wish it would be an eruption of joyous sounds, but it\u2019s just bored and polite. She takes your hand and leads you to the front of the stage.\n\nYou look at the swarm of people.
