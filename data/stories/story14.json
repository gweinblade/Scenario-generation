{"tree_id": "https://chooseyourstory.com/story/viewer/default.aspx?StoryId=61583", "context": "", "first_story_block": "\"Merlin! Hey, Merlin! Get your ass over here!\" an archeologist named Dave calls to you from across the worksite.\n\n\nDave hired you to do lighting for the archeological uncovering of the home of Merlin the Magician, but you are pretty sure he only hired you because your name matches that of the previous homeowner. Since you first started he has been complaining about everything you do. \n\n\n\"Good morning mate,\" you respond turning to face the short, balding man wearing a scowl. \"Something I can help with?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, there is actually. You know how I told you to keep things lit and not leave anything laying around?\"\n\n\n\"Sure, I have been doing a bloody good job of that over here too.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, well, that's good because on the other side of the worksite you are doing the opposite of what I asked you to do.\"\n\n\n\"Over there? You mean the corner of the site no one is working in?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that would be the one.\"\n\n\n\"Dave, I haven't been over there yet; that's why it's dark!\"\n\n\n\"You haven't been over there?\"\n\n\n\"No, not yet. I am only lighting this area, running the wires above the site, and cleaning up all of my tools as I go, just like you asked.\"\n\n\n\"And all of your tools and wires are labeled, right?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, every one of them,\" you say, pulling a spool of wire out of your pocket. You show Dave a label across the back that reads 'Merlin Ambrosius'.\n\n\nA devilish smile spreads across Dave's face. He holds out his hand to reveal a battered, rusty spool with a matching label on the back and asks, \"What does this say, Merlin?\"\n\n\n\"That is not mine, Dave.\"\n\n\n\"It has your name on it!\"\n\n\n\"It also looks like it has been here for a thousand years! If this is your idea of a joke, it isn't funny.\"\n\n\nDave looks like he is about to explode with anger when another archeologist runs up to him. The two of them whisper back and forth a few times; Dave seems to get angrier with every word either of them utter. Eventually, the second man hands something to Dave and runs off. Dave looks at the object given to him and scowls.\n\n\n\"Come here, Merlin,\" he demands, without looking at you.\n\n\nYou take a few steps forward and look at what he is holding: in his hands are a pair of rusty pliers with a label that reads 'Merlin Ambrosius'. Your jaw drops and you stammer, \"I...I don't know where those came from; they can't be mine.\"\n\n\n\"I don't care about your excuses, just go over there and make sure we don't find anything else that belongs to you!\"\n\n\nWith that, he storms off and blends in with the dozens of archeologists digging through the Paimpont Forest floor in the dimming sunlight. The floodlights are already on so that they can see anything unearthed under the dense canopy. Nothing too exciting has been unearthed, but a cottage in the Broceliande--the legendary enchanted forest near Camelot--has to belong to the famous Merlin the Magician, according to these experts.\n\n\nGrumbling to yourself, you carefully make your way across the large zone marked with wooden stakes. When it gets too dark to continue, you pull a flashlight from your bag and charge it with the attached hand-generator; traditional battery-powered flashlights have a bad habit of dying on you when you need them most. Light illuminates the forest floor once you're done cranking and you continue to the far end of the worksite.\n\n\nIn the back corner, along the edge of a large clearing, you find a shallow hole with more of your tools in it. Each one is rusty and broken, but the label with your name is visible. You pull out several items that look like broken replicas of the tools you currently are carrying: a stun gun, several rechargeable batteries, pliers, insulated and non-insulated wire, and even a hand charged flashlight are recovered from the hole, amidst a few other tools and supplies. Removing them reveals a taut wire in the bottom of the hole that looks like it is connected to something.\n\n\nYou grab the wire since it couldn't possibly be connected to a power source in the middle of the forest. Dave requires you to hang wires on stands or low tree branches to not contaminate the worksite so none were buried by you. Sparks fly when your hand touches the loose wire and electricity flows through your entire body, making it feel numb. After the shock, you pass out facedown in the dirt.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wake Up", "result": "Throbbing, your head is throbbing as you open your eyes. Everything is dark and quiet; Dave and his crew must have gone home and left you in the dirt, you think. They aren't exactly the friendliest people you have ever worked with; however, this was low, even for them. \"You could of at least have left the lights on,\" you grumble to yourself. Sitting up is difficult, but you force yourself to do it and look around anyway.\n\n\nIt is too dark to see the tip of your nose until you click your flashlight back on. The beam cuts through the night and reveals a much more overgrown forest than you remember. There are no paths, lights, wooden stakes, or tools like there were when you passed out. Everything looks like it did before the excavation started, except the trees are not trimmed.\n\n\n\u201cThere it is again! The strange lights!\u201d someone says from behind you. Hastening to turn off the flashlight, you turn to face the voice.\n\n\n\u201cI did not see anything, Sir Galeran,\u201d a second knight replies. He is carrying a torch and wearing chainmail with a sheathed sword on his hip. Terror spreads across his face as he strokes his long brown beard. The first knight is wielding his sword and a large heater shield walking in your direction, a serious, determined look in his dark eyes.\n\n\n\u201cSir Huon, have I ever led you astray?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, but we are walking through the Broceliande at night; you are asking for a confrontation with the sorcerer that plagues this forest.\u201d\n\n\nYou stare at the odd pair for a moment in silence. Their armor looks real--nothing like the paperclip replicas the kids that are into LARPing make--and they move in it easily despite the weight. Sir Galeran\u2019s sword is also the real deal; it is sharpened to a point on both sides and gives no impression of being a toy. All their gear has a crest marked on it, something that looks like it is out of a storybook about Camelot you read as a child. They slowly approach you.\n\n\n\u201cUther\u2019s orders were clear, Huon: we are to investigate the source of the light and return only after we make every attempt to identify what caused it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is good to hear that you are still loyal to a fault, Galeran.\u201d\n\n\nBreathing quietly becomes difficult as you start to realize something isn't right. Why are these knights here? Who are they? What happened to me? These questions and more swirl in your head, making you dizzy. Your hyperventilation draws the attention of the two knights, who turn and peer directly at you.\n\n\n\"What was that?\" Huon whispers frantically.\n\n\n\"I don't know, I can't see anything in this darkness, but be ready and stay close,\" Galeran answers.\n\n\nHuon draws his sword, and the two knights head straight towards you. The glow from their torch flickers menacingly, searching for you in the darkness of the forest floor. Their cautious steps give you time; however, they are probably close enough to hear you if you try to run.\n\n\nIf these two are real knights, letting them find you might be a bad idea. If they are assuming it is a sorcerer producing the light you might be able to fool them. You already have your flashlight in one hand and a small stun gun you typically carry in your bag in the other. You take a deep breath and make up your mind on what to do.", "action_results": [{"action": "Use the stun gun to incapacitate them.", "result": "Waiting until the knights are close, you step out from behind a tree and click on the stun gun. Huon is closer, so you jam the stun gun into his side; he stiffens and drops his torch and sword, making the arc of electricity shocking him the only light source as the torch self extinguishes. Sir Galeran holds up his shield and crouches like he expects to be hit head-on with a fireball while Huon collapses on the ground\n\n\n\u201cWho dares enter my forest?\u201d you yell, clicking on the flashlight to disorient Galeran.\n\n\n\u201cWe are knights of Camelot, we mean you no harm, mighty sorcerer,\" Sir Galeran says.\n\n\n\"Then take your friend back to Camelot, before I decide to kill you both, Sir Galeran.\"\n\n\n\"How... how did you know my name?\"\n\n\n\"I know many things, but you are trying my patience.\" You click on the stun gun again to make electricity arc between the two diodes; Galeran looks at the controlled thunderstorm you are holding, throws Huon over his shoulder, and runs as if under the impression that you could shoot lightning from your hands. \n\n\nWhen the knights disappear into the darkness of the woods, you sigh and sit on a fallen log. Strange days were an occupational hazard for you, but today was the worst by far; focusing on what you can do to improve the situation is the only distraction you have thought. You need to find a place to eat, sleep, and not be killed if more knights showed up.\n\n\nFortunately, sweeping the flashlight in a quick circle reveals that there is a cottage in a clearing nearby. Approaching the quaint cobblestone cottage, you look up at the straw roof and single chimney that rises in the back of the otherwise circular building with a wooden door and a small round window on one side. There is even a well on the other end of the clearing. Hesitantly you step inside the open door, knowing you do not own the place.\n\n\nInside there is one room with modest furnishings: a straw mattress curved along the wall opposite the window, a wooden table and chair are set beneath the window, and the fireplace is across from the door.  Other than the furniture there are logs in the fireplace, sacks of flour and other common food staples, and a barrel with three swords and a small anvil inside. Everything looks as if someone is living in the cottage, but no one is there.\n\n\nFeeling the exhaustion from the long day you light the fireplace with a small lighter from your bag, sit on the bed, and wonder where the cottage's owner could be. Many other questions swirl around in your mind, making you tired. You drift to sleep before long; however, your slumber is not restful as your mind continues to try to analyze what has happened, leaving you with haunting nightmares about Dave hiring LARPers to kill you.\n\n\nWaking in a cold sweat, you sit up as someone pounds on the door. \"Please open the door in the name of King Uther of Camelot!\" a vaguely familiar voice calls.\n\n\n\"Who is there?\" you ask nervously.\n\n\n\"I am Sir Galeran, a knight of Camelot, we have come here seeking the sorcerer residing in the Broceliande by order of the king.\"\n\n\n\"What does the king want with me?\" you say, jumping gout of bed and readying your stun gun.\n\n\n\"It is him, we should flee while we can,\" a second voice you recognize as Huon's says.\n\n\n\"The king's orders were clear, Huon,\" Galeran responds.\n\n\n\"The last time you said that the sorcerer struck me with lightning!\"\n\n\n\"What did the king send you here for?\" you interrupt.\n\n\n\"Of course, we were sent to find you; King Uther recognizes your unique talents and wants your help!\" Galeran says.\n\n\n\"He wants my help?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Camelot faces several plights. If you could help us with just one of them, we could surely reward you for your troubles.\"\n\n\n\"What if I refuse?\"\n\n\nThere is a long pause before Galeran answers. \"Should you turn your back on the king's request, he will assume you are a danger to Camelot. We would rather rely on you as an ally.\"\n\n\n\"May I ask what plights Uther needed my help with?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"Camelot has grown under King Uther's rules, but the growth gave rise to famine and disease. If we do not have an exceptional harvest this year, people will starve; of course, letting the plague go unchecked will be just as devastating...\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell me more about the famine", "result": "\"Tell me more about the famine,\" you say, opening the door to face the knights. Magically curing diseases does not seem like something an electrician can do; admittedly, feeding the masses is not your favorite miracle, but you have to try one.\n\n\n\"There is no famine, yet, but our fields can not support the population if we continue to grow at this rate,\" Huon responds.\n\n\n\"We can take you to the fields. King Uther wants to know if our harvest could be increased with your magic,\" Galeran adds.\n\n\nWithout delay, the pair of knights lead you through the woods towards Camelot. After walking for several minutes, the trees give way to a large field with a majestic stone castle standing at the center surrounded by two cobblestone walls and a small city. The outer wall surrounds the city, and farmland stretches out from the wall to the woods. Half of each field is planted while half remains fallow.\n\n\n\"What is planted here?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Our main crops are wheat and oats in the two larger fields, but we also grow rye and beans from time to time in the smaller fields,\" Huon says. \"We use a two-field system, so the soil can rest in the fallow field to recover for the next year.\"\n\n\n\"Can your magic help us increase our harvest?\" Galeran asks.\n\n\n\"I guess you could use a three-field system...\" you say.\n\n\n\"What is a three-field system?\" Huon asks.\n\n\n\"It's a... err... magic planting system where you can leave one-third of the field fallow, rather than half.\"\n\n\n\"Fascinating! How does it work?\"\n\n\n\"Simple, you plant two different crops in the other two-thirds of the field and rotate them like you have been.\"\n\n\n\"Why two different crops?\"\n\n\n\"Because the different crops take different nutri--I mean... that is how the magic works.\"\n\n\n\"Well, what crops need to be planted in each field?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "\"First, plant wheat.\"", "result": "\"And?\" Huon asks, prodding you to continue.", "action_results": [{"action": "\"Second, plant wheat.\"", "result": "\"That's all? We can certainly do that!\" Huon says. \"That alone will solve our problems! With more of the field planted, we will be able to feed everyone.\"\n\n\n\"There's one more thing that you need to do,\" you respond. \"Your fields will not sustain the crops unless you complete the magic ritual.\"\n\n\n\"Magic ritual?\" Galeran repeats.\n\n\n\"Just something to ensure that the magical planting doesn't wear off and make the soil barren.\"\n\n\n\"What sort of ritual must we do?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "You must have beautiful young maidens ride cows in the fallow field", "result": "\"You must find several beautiful young maidens and make them ride cows in the fallow fields; this will start after you plant and continue until the harvest,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Maidens riding cows in a fallow field?\" Galeran says as he scratches his chin. \"How exactly will that make the fields produce?\"\n\n\n\"Well, the cows will fertilize the field, and the girls are just eye-candy--I mean... Are you questioning my magic? Do you want my spell to work or not?\"\n\n\n\"Fertilize? Eye what? Err, never mind, we can talk to the king and see what we can do...\"\n\n\nWith that, Huon and Galeran scamper back to Camelot to inform the king of your assessment of the field. They mutter to each other as they walk away; all you can hear are the words \"dinner,\" \"eye-candy,\" and \"three-field.\" You can't be sure how they feel about your advice, but Huon seems excited about it. All that remains for you to do is go home and wait.\n\n\nBack at the cottage, you make yourself at home. Whoever owns the place still has yet to show up, so you figure you can claim it; there isn't much to do, though. You fetch water, start a fire, and try to figure out how people took a bath in medieval times.\n\n\nAfter that, you gather some of the supplies and attempt to make dinner. Fortunately, the cottage doesn't burn down; however, your efforts do not produce anything edible. Newfound appreciation for pre-made loaves of bread doesn't fill your stomach as a knock on your door causes you to jump.\n\n\n\"Who is there?\" you ask nervously, hoping the owner of the cottage wasn't back and angry.\n\n\n\"It is I, Huon,\" the knight says, to your relief.\n\n\nYou open the door and reply, \"Huon, have you come to tell me that King Uther accepts my proposal?\"\n\n\n\"Yes! That is correct, of course, I wouldn't expect anything else from a sorcerer as powerful as you.\"\n\n\n\"Great! I will make sure the fields produce as long as your most beautiful maidens are in the field every day.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, Merlin! I also have a gift for you from The King.\" Huon steps aside as two other knights carry in a cooked boar on a roasting spit.\n\n\n\"Oh, how generous of him!\" You eye the boar excitedly, confident you will not starve for at least a few days with that.\n\n\n\"It is nothing compared to the help you have given us! We already have plans to plant the fields, and the maidens will start riding through the fallow fields tomorrow.\"\n\n\nAfter that, Huon leaves in a hurry; he seems more excited about your three-field system than any sane person should be. You waste no time gorging yourself on the roasted meat. Once you have eaten your fill, you get ready for bed. Your final thoughts of the day are about what beautiful maidens will be on display a short walk from your new cottage; tomorrow you will go and get an answer to that question.\n\n\nDay-old boar for breakfast isn't ideal, but it is all that you have. Eating is just something you have to do before you make the short walk through the woods to Camelot's farms. Your day immediately improves once you arrive; roughly a dozen of the most beautiful women you have ever seen are begrudgingly riding around on cows in the section of the field closest to you.\n\n\nOne of the maidens catches your eye as the most gorgeous among them. She is a blonde your age with blonde hair and timid blue eyes that dart around the field like she expects to be attacked. You stare at her for long enough that she glances at you and makes eye contact before both of you blush and look away. Her petite figure and soft features, combined with her apparent nervousness, make her seem cute beyond measure.\n\n\nYou sigh, watch her blonde hair dance in the wind, and wonder if there is a way to talk to her. Without so much as her name, it seems unlikely; however, daydreaming of having dinner with her becomes one of your favorite pastimes in Camelot very quickly. You're thankful to discover that she is always on \"magic ritual duty,\" which is what you name their job.", "action_results": [{"action": "One year later", "result": "Roughly a year passes, though you can't be sure of the time since your calendar app isn't working, and the first harvest yielded more food than Camelot needed. King Uther showed up at your cottage to thank you in person over the winter; something you imagine does not happen often.\n\n\nStill, your reputation around Camelot is barely positive. Villagers started calling you Merlin the Magician, but they also started a rumor that you eat children. One farmer even claims that you ate his daughter, who went missing some time ago; of course, he won't formally accuse you of a crime since you are fueling the magical fields.\n\n\nYou put a questionable loaf of bread on the table and take the chicken off the fire; your cooking skills have improved somewhat over the year. Sitting down to eat your loneliness reminds you that the girls will be starting magic ritual duty soon since the fields have been planted. All you have for entertainment is watching the maidens in the field and daydreaming about talking to the beautiful blonde; winter is particularly boring without this luxury. \n\n\nEating alone in the woods causes a certain paranoia, so when you first hear the yelling and cheering outside, you chalk it up to imagination. When it gets louder, you look out the window and notice that your cottage is being surrounded by pitchforks and torches; panic quickly overtakes you as there is a knock at your door. You open it slowly and see Huon standing on the other side.\n\n\n\"Come out, Merlin,\" he says menacingly.\n\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" you ask nervously.\n\n\n\"These people want answers,\" Huon gestures towards the crowd as he speaks.\n\n\n\"Answers? I haven't done anything!\"\n\n\n\"Is that so? Well, you were supposed to be tending to the magical fields!\"\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\"Don't play dumb: you know the fields are not producing this year. The sprouts are sickly because the soil is no longer fertile; this problem was prevalent before we switched to the two-field system. Your magic isn't working, Merlin!\"\n\n\nThinking for a moment, you respond, \"It's the crops! We planted too many of a similar type in each field!\"\n\n\n\"We will not listen to your excuses! King Uther turned a blind eye to your foul deeds because of your magic, but if your magic will not help us, then you will not be pardoned for your crimes!\"\n\n\n\"I haven't committed any crimes!\"\n\n\n\"We shall see about that.\"\n\n\nHuon nods to another man who steps forward and says, \"This sorcerer ate my daughter! She was in the field riding cows at his request, he was watching her with hunger in his eyes, and she never came home.\"\n\n\n\"What proof do you have?\" you ask desperately.\n\n\nHuon motions to someone else in the crowd and says, \"Viviane, tell them.\"\n\n\nYou gasp as the beautiful blue-eyed blonde from the field steps forward. She looks at her shoes and says, \"Umm... The sorcerer watches me...\"\n\n\n\"How does he watch you?\" Huon asks.\n\n\n\"He is creepy like he wants to eat me.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, Viviane, you can return home now.

You fetch water, start a fire, and try to figure out how people took a bath in medieval times.\n\n\nFortunately, before you can attempt to cook anything, a blonde girl your age with blonde hair and timid blue eyes shuffles into your cottage. She glances at you nervously from the doorway holding a woven-wicker basket. You stare back at her for a moment before both of you blush and look away. Her petite figure and soft features, combined with her apparent nervousness, make her seem cute beyond measure.\n\n\n\"Don't just walk in, Viviane, that is rude,\" Huon says nervously appearing in the doorway. \"Ah, Merlin, there you are!

Why would I want to do that?\" you ask, horrified that Viviane's first impression of you is that you are a cannibal.\n\n\n\"My father says that anyone who does magic is wicked...\"\n\n\n\"Well, I am going to eat the dinner you made me... and I have never ate a person.\"\n\n\n\"Do you promise?\"\n\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\n\n\"Then I'll stay, but only because you said you would make the food grow...\"\n\n\nAfter that, Huon leaves in a hurry; it seems like he might also believe you eat people and doesn't want to stick around to find out if it is true. Once you are alone, Viviane doesn't leave the door frame for a long time. She continues to stare at her feet but occasionally glances at you or out the door. Several minutes pass with you eating roasted boar before she gets comfortable enough to even sit down.\n\n\nWanting to make a good impression, you do not rush her. You invite her to eat with you, but she politely refuses as if you asked her to be to entree. Praying for her to calm down and talk to you doesn't work; however, she does look more comfortable being there over time.\n\n\nEventually, you finish eating and send her home with the empty basket. On her way out the door, Viviane asks if she will be staying for dinner again tomorrow; you tell her that she can if she wishes but doesn't have to.

Several scandals and a few good laughs later, it is time for Viviane to leave. Her departure is the worst part of any day, so you always go straight to sleep.\n\n\nStraw mattresses are not comfortable, but you have grown accustomed to yours. Drifting to sleep is easier now than it was when you first arrived; however, your rest is short-lived. The instant your eyes close, your door flies open. Viviane rushes inside with a pained expression in her blue eyes.\n\n\n\"Merlin! Get up!\" she shouts.\n\n\nSitting straight up and rubbing your eyes, you respond, \"Viviane? What are you doing; what is wrong?\"\n\n\nTears stream down her face, and she avoids eye contact with you while speaking frantically, \"You need to leave Merlin. It's the fields; they aren't producing like they did last year.\"\n\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\"Huon said the sprouts are sickly because the soil is no longer fertile; this problem was prevalent before we switched to the two-field system.

I wish I could...\"\n\n\n\"Why can't you? We can run away together!\"\n\n\n\"Please, Merlin, go!\" \n\n\nYells and cheers indicative of an angry mob prevent you from arguing further. Stepping outside, you can see a conglomeration of torches and pitchforks marching through the woods. Without Viviane's warning, they may have cornered you inside the tiny hut. Thankfully, they are all approaching from the same direction.\n\n\nRunning in the opposite direction is your only choice; a flashlight guides your way through the dark and unfamiliar forest of the Broceliande. Your flashlight cuts through the darkness like a knife, illuminating your path with a narrow beam.

In that mere moment, you trip and fall. You expect to hit the ground quickly, but the fall continues for far longer than it should; eventually, over-rotation causes you to slam into the ground on your back. Laying there unable to move, you look up at a twenty-foot ledge.\n\n\nA large rock marks the top of the pit you are in. It is the only thing you can see besides dirt as the sounds of an angry mob start to grow louder. You wonder what would be better, to be found and killed by the mob, or left in this hole to die. Turning your mind to the field to distract yourself, all you can think of is that the fields may not have received enough fertilizer. Footsteps break your train of thoughts; they sound like they are separated from the mob.\n\n\nWithout thinking, you yell, \"Viviane is that you? Come help me!\"\n\n\n\"It is him, over here!\" someone you don't recognize calls after peeking into the hole.\n\n\nSoon the top of the hole you fell into is filled with torchlight and pitchforks. People mutter to each other, but no one attempts to help you out of the pit. Nothing happens until Huon's face peers over the edge.\n\n\n\"Well, I guess she took care of the punishment for us,\" Huon says.\n\n\n\"What?\" you croak.\n\n\n\"Don't play dumb with me; we know everything. You stopped using magic on the field and taught Viviane witchcraft.\"\n\n\n\"No, I--\"\n\n\n\"It backfired though.

Leave him and find the witch, she couldn't have gotten far.\"\n\n\nHuon turns and walks away, dispersing the crowd to find Viviane. You cant move, so climbing out of the pit is out of the question.

King Uther wants to know if the sick can be cured with your magic,\" Galeran adds.\n\n\nWithout delay, the pair of knights lead you through the woods towards Camelot. After walking for several minutes, the trees give way to a large field with a majestic stone castle standing at the center surrounded by two cobblestone walls and a small city. The outer wall surrounds the city, which is a collection of buildings that look like bigger versions of your cottage. Closer inspection reveals that the streets are teeming with people bustling about.\n\n\nWhen you arrive in town, the smell hits you like a semi-truck carrying a septic tank. It is like the streets are paved with shit and urine. Cobblestone buildings packed close together shade the dirt paths between them, which are damp despite the lack of rain. \n\n\n\"What is that?\" you ask, unable to stand the pungent odor.\n\n\n\"That is God's House,\" Huon says, gesturing towards a large building at the end of the street. It takes you a minute to remember that God's House is what they called medieval hospitals. They are little more than a large room with cots and a chapel.\n\n\n\"Oh, right, I meant the smell.\" Just as you finish talking, a woman opens the door of the building next to you and dumps a bucket of shit directly in front of you.\n\n\n\"This is how it always smells in the town,\" Galeran says.\n\n\n\"Tell me, what symptoms are people showing?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Symptoms?\"\n\n\n\"How are they dying.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, they usually get hot to the touch and start sweating.

I will make sure it happens.\"\n\n\nHuon and Galeran escort you back to the woods, then scamper back to Camelot to inform the king of your assessment of the plague. They mutter to each other as they walk away; all you can hear are the words \"hole,\" \"every week,\" and \"magical protection.\" You can't be sure how they feel about your advice, but Huon seems excited about it. All that remains for you to do is go home and wait.\n\n\nBack at the cottage, you make yourself at home. Whoever owns the place still has yet to show up, so you figure you can claim it; there isn't much to do, though. You fetch water, start a fire, and try to figure out how people took a bath in medieval times. This last task is of particular importance since you smell like Camelot's streets.\n\n\nAfter that, you gather some of the supplies and attempt to make dinner. Fortunately, the cottage doesn't burn down; however, your efforts do not produce anything edible. Newfound appreciation for pre-made loaves of bread doesn't fill your stomach as a knock on your door causes you to jump.\n\n\n\"Who is there?\" you ask nervously, hoping the owner of the cottage wasn't back and angry.\n\n\n\"It is I, Huon,\" the knight says, to your relief.\n\n\nYou open the door and reply, \"Huon, have you come to tell me that King Uther accepts my proposal?\"\n\n\n\"Yes! That is correct, of course, I wouldn't expect anything else from a sorcerer as powerful as you.\"\n\n\n\"Great! I will make sure Camelot is protected from the plague once you dig the hole; this will continue for a long as you keep covering the holes and making new ones weekly.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, Merlin! I also have a gift for you from The King.\" Huon steps aside as two other knights carry in a cooked boar on a roasting spit.\n\n\n\"Oh, how generous of him!\" You eye the boar excitedly, confident you will not starve for at least a few days with that.\n\n\n\"It is nothing compared to the help you have given us! We already have plans to dig the first hole, and The King's groundskeeper will be in charge of digging a new one each week.\"\n\n\nAfter that, Huon leaves in a hurry; he seems more excited about your three-field system than any sane person should be. You waste no time gorging yourself on the roasted meat. Once you have eaten your fill, you get ready for bed. Your final thoughts of the day are about how terrible you still smell, despite your best efforts to bathe.\n\n\nDay-old boar for breakfast isn't ideal, but it is all that you have. Eating is just something you have to do before you make the short walk through the woods to Camelot's new latrine. You're surprised to find that the hole is already dug and that women are already lined up to dump yesterdays crap into it.\n\n\nOne of the maidens catches your eye as the most gorgeous among them. She is a blonde your age with blonde hair and timid blue eyes that dart around the woods like she expects to be attacked. You stare at her for long enough that she glances at you and makes eye contact before both of you blush and look away. Her petite figure and soft features, combined with her apparent nervousness, make her seem cute beyond measure.\n\n\nYou sigh, ignore the bucket of shit in her hands, and wonder if there is a way to talk to her somewhere else.

Villagers started calling you Merlin the Magician, but they also started a rumor that you eat children. One farmer even claims that you ate his daughter, who went missing some time ago; of course, he won't formally accuse you of a crime since you are fueling the magical plague-barrier.\n\n\nYou put a questionable loaf of bread on the table and take the chicken off the fire; your cooking skills have improved somewhat over the year. Sitting down to eat reminds you of how lonely you are; cannibal magicians are not popular around Camelot. Your only pastime over the last year was to see the cute blue-eyed blonde at the latrine. \n\n\nEating your dried out attempt at bread makes you thirsty, so you head outside and draw water from the well. As you drink directly from the bucket in the well, you notice the faint smell of urine.

They seem to be an angry mob, and they are headed towards your cottage. Your instincts lead you to hide from them in the bushes as they pass.\n\n\nWhen a few collapse on the trail coughing, you think you know why they are mad. The plague is back, and if it is in the water supply, it is much worse now. Passing by Camelot allows you to see many more sick people; they are roaming the streets and collecting at God's House.\n\n\nDisgusted with the entire situation, you shuffle through the city and continue upriver.  You hope to clear the latrine and make camp; resting where there is clean water is the only smart plan. After that, there is no plan.

Her petite figure and soft features, combined with her apparent nervousness, make her seem cute beyond measure.\n\n\n\"Don't just walk in, Viviane, that is rude,\" Huon says nervously appearing in the doorway. \"Ah, Merlin, there you are!

I will make sure Camelot is protected from the plague once you dig the hole.\"\n\n\n\"That is excellent news! I will return and tell The King at once; Viviane, leave The Sorcerer his dinner and let's be off.\"\n\n\n\"Hold on now, can't she stay and join me for dinner?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, I didn't think you would want her bothering you...\"\n\n\n\"She is no bother to me. Won't you stay, Viviane?\" You turn to the beautiful blonde as you speak and lock eyes with her.\n\n\nViviane looks down at her shoes and says, \"As long as you promise not to eat me and to make the plague stop, I can stay.\"\n\n\n\"Eat you? Why would I want to do that?\" you ask, horrified that Viviane's first impression of you is that you are a cannibal.\n\n\n\"My father says that anyone who does magic is wicked...\"\n\n\n\"Well, I am going to eat the dinner you made me... and I have never ate a person.\"\n\n\n\"Do you promise?\"\n\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\n\n\"Then I'll stay, but only because you said you would get rid of the plague...\"\n\n\nAfter that, Huon leaves in a hurry; it seems like he might also believe you eat people and doesn't want to stick around to find out if it is true. Once you are alone, Viviane doesn't leave the door frame for a long time. She continues to stare at her feet but occasionally glances at you or out the door. Several minutes pass with you eating roasted boar before she gets comfortable enough to even sit down.\n\n\nWanting to make a good impression, you do not rush her. You invite her to eat with you, but she politely refuses as if you asked her to be to entree. Praying for her to calm down and talk to you doesn't work; however, she does look more comfortable being there over time.\n\n\nEventually, you finish eating and send her home with the empty basket. On her way out the door, Viviane asks if she will be staying for dinner again tomorrow; you tell her that she can if she wishes but doesn't have to.

Several scandals and a few good laughs later, it is time for Viviane to leave. Her departure is the worst part of any day, so you always go straight to sleep.\n\n\nStraw mattresses are not comfortable, but you have grown accustomed to yours. Drifting to sleep is easier now than it was when you first arrived; however, your rest is short-lived. The instant your eyes close, your door flies open. Viviane rushes inside with a pained expression in her blue eyes.\n\n\n\"Merlin! Get up!\" she shouts.\n\n\nSitting straight up and rubbing your eyes, you respond, \"Viviane? What are you doing; what is wrong?\"\n\n\nTears stream down her face, and she avoids eye contact with you while speaking frantically, \"You need to leave Merlin. It's the plague; it is back worse than last year.\"\n\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\"Huon said that the smell and plague are related; the smell returned worse than ever today, and people are already sick. Your magic isn't working, Merlin; they are coming here for you!\"\n\n\nJumping out of bed, you gather your few possessions. Viviane packs provisions into a leather bag and hands it to you. She can't look into your eyes without sobbing. \n\n\n\"What about you?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"They aren't after me, and you don't have time to worry.\"\n\n\n\"No, I can't just leave without you, Viviane, come with me.\"\n\n\n\"I... I wish I could...\"\n\n\n\"Why can't you? We can run away together!\"\n\n\n\"Please, Merlin, go!\" \n\n\nYells and cheers indicative of an angry mob prevent you from arguing further. Stepping outside, you can see a conglomeration of torches and pitchforks marching through the woods. Without Viviane's warning, they may have cornered you inside the tiny hut. Thankfully, they are all approaching from the same direction.\n\n\nRunning in the opposite direction is your only choice; a flashlight guides your way through the dark and unfamiliar forest of the Broceliande. Your flashlight cuts through the darkness like a knife, illuminating your path with a narrow beam.

In that mere moment, you trip and fall. You expect to hit the ground quickly, but the fall continues for far longer than it should; eventually, over-rotation causes you to slam into the ground on your back. Laying there unable to move, you look up at a twenty-foot ledge.\n\n\nA large rock marks the top of the pit you are in.

You notice you stand out sorely due to your unusual clothing; no one else is wearing khaki pants. Due to the lateness of your arrival, the streets had been empty, so you avoided the questioning glances until now.\n\n\nFortunately, Galeran returns before long and announces that King Uther will be entering to speak with you. Moments later, an elderly man with a crown steps through the door. He slowly makes his way to the throne and sits down.

Hesitantly, you step inside the open door, knowing you do not own the place.\n\n\nInside, there is one room with modest furnishings: a straw mattress is curved along the wall, a wooden table and chair are set beneath the window, and the fireplace is across from the door. Other than the furniture, there are logs in the fireplace, sacks of flour and other common food staples, and a barrel with a blacksmith's tools and three unfinished weapons. It looks like someone is living in the cottage, but no one is there.\n\n\nFeeling the exhaustion from the long day you start a fire in the hearth with a lighter from your bag, sit in the chair, and wonder where the cottage's owner could be. Your eyes drift to the barrel and the three swords within. Inspiration strikes you as the firelight reflects off the polished blades; you could make a magic sword and plant it in an anvil.\n\n\nRushing to the barrel, you pull the contents out one by one. There is a plain arming sword, a larger claymore, and an ordinate arming sword with a red gemstone on the end of the pommel. No longer feeling tired, and picking up the last blade, you examine it more closely to see that the hilt is loose and the tang is slotted to save weight.\n\n\nPlacing the ordinate weapon on the table, you grab your tools and sit down. Removing the wooden hilt is easy, since it is already split, and you examine the exposed handle. A slot in the center is just big enough to fit a small electronic device. Both the pommel and blade are magnetic, most likely made from steel.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get to work!", "result": "From your bag, you produce your small stun gun.

Once you turn the power on, it will zap anything the blade strikes. All you need to do is add a hilt since the wooden one will no longer fit.

You can make a complete seal from the guard to the gem on the bottom by heating it over the fire. To finish it off, you also cover the guard so anything the wielder might touch is insulated from the electric blade. Your finished product is a stylish, red rubber handle that looks like something from a renaissance fair.\n\n\nTurning on the device is as simple as lifting the shrink wrap and pressing the button with a few flathead screwdrivers.

A boulder in the woods not too far from your clearing is the perfect candidate. Its long flat top hangs over the side of a steep slope, with a crack straight through the middle, like it is about to split in half.  \n\n\nCarrying everything to the rock is excruciating, especially the anvil. This takes you an hour to move by itself, leaving very little time to set up before the sun rises. Thankfully, there is not much left to do.\n\n\nPlacing the anvil on top of the rock, you run the wires down through the crack to the battery below. You wedge the claymore inside the crack so that it is stuck below the anvil. The wires from the blade also connect to the battery, but they lead to opposite terminals--this should cause your two electromagnets to attract each other.\n\n\nWhen powered, the electromagnets should hold things in place well enough that no man can move the sword. One issue remains: Arthur must be able to pull it out. Running back to the cottage for a simple switch, you wire the positive terminal of the battery to it. This switch is hidden near the rock in a tree hollow. Both electromagnets are connected so they can be turned on simultaneously.\n\n\nBack at the cottage, you lie down on the straw mattress while you wait for the royal entourage to show up. Restless sleep overcomes you, but it is short-lived.\n\n\nKing Uther's arrival is not quiet. Several war horses gallop through the woods and neigh loudly when prompted to stop, startling you awake. They restlessly fuss while several knights dismount; Galeran and Huon are among them.\n\n\n\u201cMerlin, are you there?\u201d Galeran calls from outside your door.\n\n\n\u201cI am coming out,\" you reply realizing that you left several tools lying around the cottage in plain sight.\n\n\nNo one enters or bothers you until you rush out the door into the misty morning air. King Uther and Arthur sit atop their horses with the knights gathered around them; as you approach, they stand at the ready and look at you nervously. Uther, Galeran, and Huon are the only ones that do not seem suspicious of you. They also seem to be carrying a lot of supplies, as if they intend to travel for days.\n\n\n\"Good magician, are you prepared to take the King to this magic sword in the stone?\" Galeran asks you.\n\n\n\"Yes, but it is not far from here. You will not need your horses.\"\n\n\n\"We have scouted these woods many times; there is no sword matching your description this close to Camelot.\"\n\n\n\"Not one that you found, but these woods hold many secrets. This mist hides many things which can only be revealed by magic.\"\n\n\n\"What other secrets does the Broceliande hide?\" King Uther asks.\n\n\n\"For now, all you need to know is that the sword is close.\"\n\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\nUther nods to Arthur, and they dismount their steads. With everyone on foot, you lead them across the field towards the rock that holds the anvil. Thinking quickly, you wave your hands in the air and mumble, \"Donde esta el bano.\"\n\n\nNot remembering any other broken Spanish, you repeat that phrase, attempting to sound like you are dispelling the mist. By some stroke of luck, the morning fog dissipates as you walk up to the stone. King Uther and his crew stop behind you the moment it comes into view and stare at the precariously placed sword.\n\n\n\"There it is!\" Arthur shouts. You get the sense that he expected the sword to be a hoax.\n\n\n\"Indeed, it is. So what do we do, Merlin?\" King Uther asks.\n\n\n\"Only one man may try to pull the sword from the stone at a time,\" you lie. \"Only the true King of Camelot will be able to take it.\"\n\n\nArthur steps forward and says, \"I will take the sword and the throne that is rightfully mine.\"\n\n\n\"Hold on son,\" Uther responds. \"For all we know, that blade was merely placed there as a trap. Surely even Merlin will admit that the world is filled with evil sorcerers who revel at such trickery with magic.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, you can never be too cautious,\" you agree. This was something you counted on.\n\n\n\"But father, how do we know if we can trust this magician, then?\" Arthur asks.\n\n\n\"Simple. Galeran shall try to pull the sword from the stone first. He has no claim to the thrown but is one of my strongest and most loyal knights. If he can not pull the sword out, and returns from the rock safely, then you can try as well. Should you be successful after Galeran fails, we know it is true,\" King Uther explains.\n\n\n\"Great! Galeran, please try to take the sword. I should warn you that the anvil is enchanted; trying to move it or even touch it would not be wise,\" you say as Galeran steps forward.\n\n\nHe approaches the flat rock trepidly, giving you the perfect opportunity to flip the switch in the hollow. Everything is set up and ready; all you can do is watch. Galeran takes a deep breath before stretching a shaking hand towards the sword.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "Galeran grips the rubber hilt with one hand. Nothing happens, but he can\u2019t get enough leverage to even attempt to lift the sword. His face relaxes, and the tension leaves his body when he touches the sword without consequence. With a deep breath, he plants his feet and places his other hand on its pommel.\n\n\nHe bends his knees and adjusts his grip, as if he is about to lift a heavy box off the floor. When he does pull upwards, the sword doesn\u2019t move. Galeran doesn't give up, he pulls upwards from a squating position, looking like he is constipated. Only after several minutes of strenuous effort does he let go, backing away from the sword while panting, and wiping the sweat from his brow.\n\n\n\"It is stuck sire; no man could move that sword,\" Galeran says.\n\n\n\"Interesting, the magician might be speaking the truth!\" King Uther replies.\n\n\n\"I will have a go then,\" Arthur announces stepping forward.\n\n\nLike Galeran, he approaches the anvil cautiously. Peering at it, he sticks out one hand to grasp the hilt, then wraps his other hand around the first. He breathes deeply and plants his feet, which is when you flip the switch that turns off the magnets. With a grunt, Arthur bends down then extends his body, pulling the sword out of the anvil quickly. He leaves the ground from the force he exerts with his legs.\n\n\nUther and his men cheer as the young prince falls on his back and raises the sword in triumph. Getting caught in the moment, you can't help but yell with them as they start chanting, \"Arthur is worthy! Long live King Arthur!\" You are cheering more for the fact that your plan worked, but everyone else's excitement about the new King is contagious.\n\n\n\"Let us return to Camelot for Arthur's coronation!\" King Uther announces. \"Merlin, show us the way out of this fog and back to your hut.\"\n\n\nFollowing the King's orders, you lead the way back to where the day started. Once there Uther, Arthur, and the knights of Camelot prepare to ride back to the castle. Galeran and Huon offer to escort you there, but you assure them that you can find your way alone. Before the King mounts his horse, he turns to Arthur and asks to see his new weapon.\n\n\nYou caution the pair that the blade of Excalibur is imbued with magic and should not be touched, lest they turn the shockly powerful blade on themselves. They heed your warning and fit the sword into Arthur's scabbard which is, to your relief, made from leather. Examining the blade, Uther comments that it looks like one he had commissioned a local blacksmith to make for the prince. According to the King, the Smith left his forge in Camelot to live in the Broceliande and focus on his work, but they hadn't heard from him since.\n\n\nThinking quickly, you suggest that Excalibur took the form that its master desired. This seems to satisfy the King and his men. Once they ride off, you pack up your tools and materials, not knowing when the blacksmith will return to his cottage.

They are packed into the entrance hall that seemed large when it was empty last night; today it is like a small tin packed with sardines. It smells like one too.\n\n\nAfter telling a guard your name, he takes you to Huon and Galeran who usher you to a reserved area near the throne. Uther nods to you from his seat upon it and motions to the Bishop. Seconds later, the ceremony starts. Arthur emerges from the door behind the throne after a speech given in Latin, which you don't understand at all, and kneels before his father.\n\n\nLatin continues to pour out of the Bishop's mouth louder than you thought possible without a microphone. Looking around, you realize that the entrance hall is built like a reverberation chamber so the King can address large crowds, but you have to stop and pay attention when the Latin finally stops. Uther stands and smiles down at his son, who is dressed in a regal cape and fancy tunic.\n\n\n\"Arthur Pendragon, my son, do you vow to rule over all of Camelot fairly and justly?\" Uther asks.\n\n\n\"I do, father,\" Arthur responds.\n\n\n\"Do you promise to show mercy and compassion, as well as strength?\" \n\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\n\"Do you swear to maintain the authority of the church and exercise the will of God?\"\n\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\n\"Then I shall abdicate the throne and pass it on to you.\"\n\n\nUther places his crown on Arthur's head and steps aside so that his son can sit on the throne.

You glance up at the Bishop long enough to notice that he is glaring back at you, confirming that the dousing is intentional. Fortunately, he stops before you are soaked to your underwear.\n\n\nWhen the crowd settles from their second outburst of cheers, Arthur addresses them.
