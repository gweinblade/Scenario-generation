The midday sun beats down upon the combatants, bathing their skin in sweat, adding to the grime and dirt accrued. With each swing of the sword, or in one of their cases, a spear, sun glistens from the steel, sending golden rays to the sand beneath their feet. The sand, a sacred place to the warriors. The sand, soon to be painted red.\n\nThe one armed with a sword sweeps low, then high, searching for a break in his opponent\u2019s defences. His attack finds nothing but air, save for a glancing blow on the other man\u2019s bracer. The crowd cheers with the blow, despite its missed arc. They hunger for blood, and the close call excites them into a fury. Rotten vegetables, and items of similar aroma, fly from the arena\u2019s seats. Curses accompany as well, directed at both members, safely shouted from their position some fifteen feet up.\n\nBlood! A thrust of the spear lands home, spraying red onto the sand. The spearpoint, buried in the sword-wielder's gut, pauses for a moment, then emerges out the back in another crimson spread. As the pierced man drops to his knees, the crowd instantly forgets the insults directed at the apparent victor. Their favor lies with the strong, with those able to drop weak men to the dirt.\n\nSuddenly, a hand appears at the spear\u2019s shaft, caked in blood and sand. Its knuckles turn white, holding a steady grip, not allowing the spear to move. With both hands, the spear-wielder can\u2019t jar it loose. His body erupts into movement, placing one foot in front of the other for leverage, attempting to gain ownership of his weapon.\n\nStill, nothing.\n\nGritting his teeth, the man, impaled, rises from his knees, hand still on the spear. His opponent desperately tries to pull the spear from his gut, focused on the singular action. Horror spreads on his face at the sudden display of strength, highlighting his own weakness, overshadowed by resolve. How can this be? He should be dead.\n\nThe sword strikes high, its outcome delayed in arriving. A flash of steel, rush of air, and finally a head drops, the body shortly following. The man, still impaled by the spear, collapses, all his energy spent in the action. He doesn\u2019t hear the crowd chant his name. He doesn\u2019t see the dozens of women exposing themselves for him. He doesn\u2019t even see the impressed look by his master.

Long have you been at sea, chained in the same seat, hands gripped at the same oar. Sure, you can look around, but what\u2019s the point? You\u2019ll just find other men\u2019s backs. You sure as hell don\u2019t want to make eye contact with the guards. They patrol below deck with whip in hand, daring the prisoners to test them. After a few hours from departure, no one bothered to let their pride guide them into action, even if that action was as little as meeting eye contact.\n\nWeeks now, this has been your reality. In the morning, they give you a small piece of bread and tiny sips of water, then you row. You do not speak, you do not interact with your fellow prisoners. You row. You\u2019re dispensable, only allowed to live if drawing breath is beneficial to your masters. You\u2019re nothing but a warm body filling a chair, allowing a businessman miles away to receive compensation. The sooner you accept that fact, the better off you\u2019ll be.\n\nA wave crashes into the boat, showering your mostly exposed body in freezing droplets. Nearby, a whip cracks, warning you to row harder. The brewing storm doesn\u2019t make rowing easy. Malnutrition and exhaustion doesn\u2019t help either. Still, you row. It\u2019s your reality. You see the man\u2019s back, feel the smooth wooden oar at your grasp, even feeling a small dimple in the wood.\n\nEach pull of the oar sends an intentional, sharp exhale from your mouth. Allowing the oar to travel forward, naturally, you take a deep breath in, preparing for the next burst of motion. Then, with another quick exhale, you engage through hardened back muscle, aiming to use as little arm as possible in order to avoid fatigue. Better to let your back, a larger muscle group, take the bulk. Those in shackles among you learned the same trick. Together, in a perfect rhythmic beat, the enclosed area of the ship fills with men\u2019s breathing. Row, exhale. Prepare, inhale. Repeat. There are no other thoughts besides breathwork and your hands on the oar. Nothing else matters.\n\nAnother crack of the whip motivates you into movement. Simultaneously, thunder roars from the clouds above the boat in a slow, throaty rumble. Storm\u2019s brewing. You row.", "action_results": [{"action": "You row", "result": "The steady volume of rainfall grows increasingly larger in density. Strong winds howl outside the narrow gap your oar sticks through. The gap isn\u2019t big enough to see any sort of detail; it\u2019s typically just a blue dot in the left side of your peripheral vision. Now, however, it\u2019s black, occasionally flashing white with each lighting strike. Still, you row, the tumultuous water and gusts providing additional resistance. Above deck, you hear the captain shouting commands to the crew, preparing to guide the ship through the storm. Water splashes through cracks in the wood with rising volume. Each spray of icy water encourages you to row harder. Your rowing becomes the outlet in which you take your frustration out.\n\nAs if there\u2019s nothing better to do, like helping the above deck crew, several guards patrol down the center of the room cracking their whips. Their fury has heightened with the storm's build. Normally, the whip is used on those slacking in their seat. Now, they use the weapon almost at random, snapping it on the exposed backs of men working their hardest, rowing with everything they\u2019ve got. Twice, you are the victim of such prodding. The whip tears open your exposed flesh. Exposed flesh, which soon after gets stung with cold salt water.\n\nSuddenly, a massive wave crashes into the side of the ship knocking those standing, just the guards, from their feet. Unfortunately for them, the blow knocks them into the rowing slaves, falling at shackled feet. Despite the raging storm, time seems to stand still for a moment, and silence ensues. From their position on the ground, the guards look up towards the lines of slaves sitting above them. Then, as one, the slaves burst into motion. Feet stomp on the guards, keeping them in their prone position, clutching at their sides and face in protection.\n\nNone have fallen near you, so you simply watch the scene unfolding before you. Small puddles of red join with the ever present thin layer of water on the floor, spreading out, slowly losing its color into the blue. A hand clasps your back, and you look up to find a ragged face behind an unkempt beard. Drops of water fall from the man\u2019s beard as he moves. Hazel eyes meet yours, and no words are spoken. He places an item in your hand and motions for you to follow. It\u2019s a small key. Free of your shackles, you quickly follow the man. Whoever he is, releasing you from your bonds is reason enough to do his bidding.\n\nBy now, almost the entire room is free from their chains. Several guards lie bleeding on the floor, strung over the same seats that held you in place. One by one, the freed prisoners scamper up the staircase, the only exit, to the main deck.", "action_results": [{"action": "The main deck", "result": "Wind and rain greet you. The crew, busy with keeping the ship afloat, don\u2019t notice the herd of approaching slaves at first, not until several members get taken down, a few thrown overboard with strength built by the oar. Some of them shout for you to keep your distance. After all, their duty is to keep the ship above water. If it sinks, everyone goes down with it. The now-free slaves don\u2019t care. Each sailor, guard, and deckhand are treated the same. Hands, shackled for many weeks, tighten into fists, fists which find their place on the crew.\n\nThe man who placed the key in your hand is leading the charge, no stranger to combat. His body is thin, but he fights with a fury far surpassing his peers. With each ship member felled, another slave arms himself with the fallen\u2019s weapon. A few whips from below deck quickly turns into many swords and spears shared among free men.\n\nHowling wind carries men\u2019s screams overboard, losing them at sea, threatening to give their origin a similar treatment. The tide of slaves crashes into sailors, desperate to muster up a defense. Eventually, though, each is overwhelmed by sheer number. You\u2019re met with a couple sailors along the way. Each, poorly trained for combat. Their skills lie elsewhere. The short sword you\u2019ve armed yourself with makes quick work of their defense, finding gaping holes in their meager parries. The act brings a slight smile to your lips; it\u2019s been awhile, but it\u2019s good to see your skills haven\u2019t deteriorated too much since the shackles were clasped around your wrists. Your mentor would have a field day if--\n\nYour head instinctively ducks at the sudden movement in your vision. An axe plants itself in the side of the ship, not inches from where you just stood. A sailor, dressed in loose trousers and a simple shirt, unarmored, frantically tries to pry it loose, but it\u2019s firmly in place. As you bring the short sword up to finish your opponent, a wave rocks into the boat, knocking everyone to the deck. Lightning sends a surge of brightness into the air. Upon subsiding, the sudden flash keeps lingering images, ghostly figures, in your eyes for several blinks.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going down! Hang on!\u201d a voice carries over the wind. The storm encouragement enough, you grab onto a rope tied to the side of the ship and brace yourself. Contrasting lightning, the world slowly, gradually turns darker. As one, the deck\u2019s combatants halt their skirmish, turning to face the looming darkness. A wave looms over the ship, building, rising higher and higher. Ominous it grows, flexing its size over the comparatively small vessel. Then, in a burst of motion, it crashes.\n\n---\n\nA lone wooden coffin sits on a pedestal, surrounded by bright colored flowers. Candles burn at four points around the coffin, shaped in an imaginary square. You\u2019re lightless, floating above the pedestal as if a spirit. Simple stone blocks line the floor, and a small staircase leads up to the coffin.\n\nThe coffin calls to you. The lid is cracked slightly, daring you to peek inside. Taken by an impulse not known to you, you float closer. As you approach, the candle\u2019s flames intensify as if oil was poured on top. The flowers, formally an array of shining yellow, red, and white, peel back at your approaching presence. They sink inside themselves, decaying and wilting on the spot. The air around you becomes heavy, filled with the moldy smell of spoiled meat.\n\nDeath follows you, child.\n\nYour inner forearm suddenly ignites in flame. You scream, still floating in the air. The flame subsides, and left behind is the blackened image of a crow mid-flight. A woman appears at the pedestal\u2019s steps, dressed in simple religious robes. Her face is unblemished and youthful, but her eyes speak another story; they\u2019re black, piercing and born of experience. The woman\u2019s long blonde hair falls perfectly past her shoulders, to a small degree like the way hair floats underwater, the loose strands never appearing to fall in front of her gaze.\n\nScratching softly appears from the coffin, like two rough stones rubbed against one another. The coffin, surrounded and filled with death, rumbles low, its vibrations filling the room. The woman watches silently, interested to see what you do. The scratching becomes louder, building to deafening levels. Following suit, the coffin\u2019s vibration intensifies, shaking the wooden structure uncontrollably, the lid on top threatening, begging to be tossed from its cracked position. In a thunderous echo, the coffin falls from its position on the pedestal, tumbling down the stone steps stopping at the woman\u2019s feet. Rolling from within--", "action_results": [{"action": "Wake up", "result": "You awaken to find a man staring at you from above, peering at you as one would over a ledge. It\u2019s the same hazel-eyed man who released you. A burning feeling draws your attention to your arm: the image of the crow is tattooed on your forearm, aged as if it\u2019s been there for many years, yet your arm was void of ink mere hours ago. You start to say something, but immediately water rushes from within your throat in a coughing fit. After releasing the excess sea water, you speak.\n\n\u201cMade it through the storm, I see.\u201d\n\nYou see a slight grin from behind the man\u2019s beard. \u201cAn understatement, but true all the same. Are you well to rise?\u201d\n\nTaking stock of your being, you nod. Swallowing sea water seems to be the worst injury inflicted, no broken bones or cracked ribs. When a ship goes down, it\u2019s not uncommon for stray parts to land on sailors, especially when brought about by a storm\u2019s wind. You find yourself on a beach. The sand glints in the morning sunlight, contrasting with light blue waves lightly touching the shore. Men lie scattered on the beach, along with broken pieces from the ship. The few unscathed like you, help those nursing their wounds.\n\n\u201cI am Ulris Joren, but you can call me Joren,\u201d the man says, offering a hand to help you up. \u201cA holy man from the west.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich lands? The Helswith Desert?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cFarther. Into the rolling plains.\u201d\n\nThe plains are not unknown to you. Commonly referred to as \u201cbarbarian\u201d land, many different tribes roam the plains waging war with one another. Conquering brings glory to their god, or something like that. You really should have remembered more from your studies. The tribesmen are looked upon as simple barbarians to city-dwelling citizens, although they would likely place that label on anyone who hunts their own food and doesn\u2019t live within four walls.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a long way from home. Where is this place?\u201d you ask.\n\nJoren scratches his head in thought. \u201cNot sure, exactly. There are many lesser-known islands such as this in King Tristrand\u2019s land...his waters to be more accurate. With his entire nation a series of islands, it\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better move away from the beach then,\u201d you say. \u201cTristrand\u2019s ships likely patrol these waters. No doubt they\u2019ll be searching for survivors after finding the wreckage.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind a path in the jungle. I\u2019ll work on speeding up the others\u2019 recovery,\u201d Joren says, emanating the green glow of healing magic from his palm.\n\nHoly man indeed. \u201cNeat trick,\u201d you answer, heading for the tree line.\n\nThe jungle is dense. Vines hang from unseen, covered branches, twisting and growing around one another. Critters, out of sight, chirp, croak, and whistle as you meander through the trees. With Joren\u2019s healing magic, all the shipwrecked prisoners walk mostly free of injury. More importantly, no injury slows down the pack. There are twenty-two of you total, a fraction of the number chained to the oar.\n\nWith no food and no water, your main priority is finding just that. Fortunately, you\u2019re all used to eating very little, which is, perhaps, the only benefit to being under the whip. Still, you needed to find something, otherwise the miracle of surviving the shipwreck would be short-lived.\n\nSingle file, you lead the survivors, Joren behind you, through the thicket, knocking down stray foliage in your path with a walking staff picked up from the shore. It\u2019s not nearly as efficient as a blade, but you\u2019d rather not go out of your way to touch your exposed flesh on the plants. It\u2019s bad enough wearing a simple loincloth and no shoes. Who knows might happen if an unidentified plant pricks your skin? You sure as hell don\u2019t want to find out, especially if Joren\u2019s magic doesn\u2019t extend to toxins.\n\nThe jungle suddenly opens up into a clearing, giving you a full view of the surrounding hillside. Large stones scatter in lush grass like freckles on a spotted egg. That\u2019s not what draws your attention, though. A single stream of smoke, emanating from a lone smokestack immediately attracts your gaze. The smokestack comes from one of three huts arranged in a semicircle, a farm at their backs.\n\n\u201cSmells like fuckin\u2019 dinnertime,\u201d one of the survivors bellows, his low voice unfitting for the thin body it originates from.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too quick to raid,\u201d Joren answers. \u201cWe know nothing about the island\u2019s inhabitants.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t your people live for raiding, priest? The Great Warlord of legend would be disappointed.\u201d\n\nBefore the man can react, Joren grabs him by the hair and pulls his neck back, exposing it into the open air. Joren holds his pointer finger out, igniting the tip with holy flame, and holds it mere inches from his neck. \u201cDo not mistake my caution for cowardice. You know nothing of the Great Warlord.\u201d\n\nJoren doesn\u2019t wait for the man\u2019s response before tossing him to the ground. Several other survivors help the man to his feet. He spits on the ground upon standing upright. \u201cStay here and starve then.

Despite the circumstances, you desperately need food and water. The huts below offer both. Joren shakes his head, disapproving of the choice. You, along with most of the survivors, creep down the hillside using the scattered stones as cover. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s better than nothing. You move slowly, rather than swift, in order to blend in with the environment. Sudden movements have a way of drawing attention. You hope that moving deliberately will come across unseen over such a large span of land.\n\nNo movement emanates from the huts, the same for the farm behind. Collectively, the group decides that making for the hut with the smokestack is the best bet. Who knows? Maybe food is being prepared on the fire already. The group surrounds the hut and bursts through the front and back door simultaneously. Surprised, a woman inside drops a pan she\u2019s holding, sending its contents scattered on the floorboards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking that food now,\u201d the survivor leading the group says. \u201cAmong other things,\u201d he adds with a wink and glance downward.\n\nExpecting the woman to continue her frightened state, you\u2019re caught off-guard when she places her hands on her hips and narrows her brow. \u201cNow you just went and done the stupidest, motherfucking thing of your life,\u201d she says, bending down to scoop up the pan. She shovels the food back onto the cast iron, nonchalantly as if she doesn\u2019t notice the mob of half-naked men who barged into her hut.\n\n\u201cYou little bitch\u2026\u201d the man curses as he walks forward, removing his loincloth to make good on his promise. Whirling through the air, a flash of steel appears suddenly. At the same time, the man screams and clutches his groin area. You can\u2019t see, since his hands cover the area, but streaks of red spill from beneath. Then, you catch sight of it: a throwing dagger lies buried in the wall, pinning the man\u2019s appendage along with it. Several more whirls of air later, you lie bleeding out on the floor, two sizable throwing knives sticking from your torso. You bleed out, half-naked and unarmed, but at least with your manhood still attached. Your assailants, unseen.

You\u2019ll not have any of my share,\u201d the man answers. Most of the other survivors join with him. Maybe they are right, but with no clothes, weapons, or supplies, you\u2019d rather not come face to face with equipped warriors or worse yet, roaming mages. The island is a perfect spot for a spellcaster to experiment without fear of collateral damage. If it\u2019s truly uncharted in Tristrand\u2019s waters, it also possesses, or rather lacks, law enforcement. From the 22 of you, only less than ten decide to stay with you and Joren.\n\nYou watch the man take off with most of the survivors. They creep down the hillside, making use of the scattered boulders for cover. It\u2019s not exactly the most hidden pathway, but it\u2019s the best they\u2019ve got. No movement is visible from the huts, though the rising smoke means someone\u2019s home; the only issue is finding out who exactly. Hooking a shark on the end of a fishing pole isn\u2019t exactly ideal. They surround and enter the hut. Still, the lone stream of smoke rises.\n\n\u201cWhy did you not join them?\u201d\n\nYou turn around towards the direction of the voice. No one\u2019s there. Joren and the others apparently heard it too as they\u2019re scanning for the source as well.\n\n\u201cWas it wisdom? Compassion?\u201d\n\nThe voice fades in and out, differing in volume levels, starting loud in your right ear and finishing soft in your left.\n\n\u201cReveal yourself, spirit!\u201d you shout.\n\nThere is no response to your command, save for a low chuckle that could have just been your imagination. Glass shatters, distracting your focus from seeking the voice. Smoke begins to rise at your feet, spreading too rapidly to simply be normal smoke. It fills your vision in mere seconds, preventing you from seeing the others standing next to you. Then, a sluggishness draws over your body, like a great weight is placed upon you. You collapse to one knee, refusing to fall completely. Eventually, though, it overtakes you.\n\n---\n\nYour body is conscious, but your vision is still black. A dark canvas hood covers your head, disallowing you to see your environment. Your wrists are bound together in front of your body, the rope, scratchy on your bare skin. Your knees ache, but you know any attempt to stand would be dealt with swiftly. The flooring beneath you is firm and unpadded. You hear breathing next to you, likely the others are next to you, hooded and bound the same.\n\n\u201cThe settlers on this island are under our protection,\u201d a voice speaks. It\u2019s not the same voice as before, but a woman\u2019s. \u201cYour allies\u2019 savagery have been dealt with. You did not follow in their ways. Why?\u201d\n\nAfter a moment of silence, you answer for the survivors. \u201cWe know nothing of this place. Our ship crashed on the shore.\u201d\n\nThe woman utters half a laugh. \u201cAnd here I thought you were wandering around naked for the fun of it.\u201d Turning serious, she adds on. \u201cStill, there\u2019s a small matter of secrecy. You see, we can\u2019t let our location be known to outsiders such as yourself, shipwreck or no. It\u2019s nothing personal, really. We will make it swift. Make peace with your gods.\u201d\n\nA few feet away, you hear a sharp pierce and gurgle soon followed by a dull thud as a body drops to the floor. Several more times, piercing, gurgling, and thudding. Footsteps draw closer to you. They pause for a moment, allowing you to \u201cmake your peace.\u201d Sensing motion, you reactively bring your arms up in defense.\n\nWhirling in the air, steel clashes against steel. Light blinds you for a moment as the dark hood around your head is ripped off. A woman stands above you, dagger in hand, looking just as surprised as you are. Dark strands of hair tucked behind her ear toy with falling from their position, dark strands which appear to be unnaturally black. To your left, a throwing dagger lies buried in a wood column.\n\n\u201cThat tattoo. Where did you get it?\u201d the same voice from earlier rings.\n\nCaught off guard, you attempt to explain it, but then realize you can\u2019t really explain it. \u201cIt just...sort of appeared,\u201d you answer with complete honesty.

Kill the other.\u201d\n\nThe woman raises her weapon high. Light flashes from the finely sharpened point. She thrusts forward. Vision restored, you react to the strike doing the only thing you can. Your bound hands catch the blade, slicing open your exposed palms. Steel tears into your flesh. Pressure added by the woman only deepens the fresh wounds on your hands. Fresh wounds, which still hold the originating cause. The woman attempts to press the blade into Joren, but still you hold fast stopping the point from entering his chest.\n\n\u201cSo be it.

It\u2019s every man for himself, all in search of the most treasured prize: freedom.\n\nMen who he had embarrassed in sparring sessions, return the favor sevenfold upon his return. Their previous lessons, learned from the sharp sting of the practice sword, were enacted back on their \u201cteacher.\u201d Paxson gladly took each lesson, after all, he did start in their position once upon a time. This time, however, his mind is sharp with victory in the arena. Wisdom guides his ferocity, tempering it into a sharpened weapon with deadly purpose.\n\nSlowly, day by day, improvement was made. His sword arm grew strong again, no longer weighted by the weapon. The sword, an extension of his arm, was now raised as easily as pointing a finger. Hardened muscle built back into his shield arm, absorbing blows that would deaden most into abandoning the protective weapon. With her on his mind, Paxson holds an unstoppable will.

He saves that fury for the arena.\n\nArroden waits for the gladiator in his study. A large map rests on the center table. In the top eastern corner of the map, Paxson sees King Tristrand\u2019s islands, some uncharted and unexplored, but all lie within the might of Tristrand\u2019s fleet. The islands lie just opposite of the Breckenridge Channel, a small body of water connecting the Helswith Desert to Tristrand\u2019s \u201cland.\u201d To the western edge of the Helswith border, a large land body is colored red and is sweeping towards the desert.\n\n\u201cYou were military before arriving here,\u201d Arroden speaks flatly. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d\n\nPaxson eyes the map once more, well aware of the guards behind him keeping a steady hand on their hilts. \u201cThe lands to the west are being overrun. Who does the red represent? I do not see a sigil or coat of arms associated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do not have a unifying banner. The barbarian tribes in the west have banded together on a warpath,\u201d Arroden says as if one explaining soft notes in a red wine.\n\n\u201cImpossible. There is too much infighting between tribes to organize anything, especially something of this magnitude. The tribes have only unified once, under the Great Warlord of old.

He offers a glass to Paxson, who takes it. You don\u2019t say no to the master. \u201cCopies of this map have been dispersed to all nobility within Helswith. High Lord Ursa is offering substantial reward for any warriors that can be \u2018volunteered\u2019 into service, seasoned gladiators highly sought after. The High Lord\u2019s already conscripted those he can into his ranks.\u201d\n\nPaxson glances down at the map again. The wave of red, the barbarian horde, is mere miles away from entering the desert. To his knowledge, the High Lord\u2019s army isn\u2019t vastly numberable, but their chariots are deadly to face in open ground. Between the chariots and extreme conditions of the desert, High Lord Ursa\u2019s land seems well-defended. Still, in war, sheer number can overtake the most disciplined of armies defending key positions. It all depends on how many bodies are thrown at accomplishing the goal. Paxson has no doubt the horde is willing to throw as many as necessary.\n\n\u201cThe battleground is vastly different from the arena,\u201d Paxson says. \u201cThere\u2019s too many factors that a gladiator is untrained for.

It was almost as if you knew what was going to happen. Not specifically, of course, but the scene in your mind played out eerily similar. Killian might have been the one to help you understand as he was in the master\u2019s role.

Two travel packs are already filled with supplies and sitting at the base of the trunk. She picks up both and tosses one behind her, almost taking your head off. One of your hands catches the leather straps mid-flight, and you swing the entire thing onto your back.\n\nStill unspeaking, she leads you from the ruined remains of the temple and into the surrounding forest.

Scattered like stones on a hill, islands mark the water, creating spots of green in the ocean blue.\n\nMorgan scans through the bushes, searching for something, and finally she pulls two large coils of rope securely fastened, or rather, welded, to a large boulder. Two packs, two coils of rope, she knew this day was coming, but somehow you didn\u2019t imagine she imagined it\u2019d be you. Killian, most likely. She throws you a coil and begins to suspend herself over the cliff\u2019s edge. You glance down at the sheer mountainside, taking note of the jagged, spear-like rocks waiting for you in the water.

Passing through the winding streets, ignoring peddlers, street vendors, and some very direct and rather vulgar \u201ccompanions,\u201d you head straight for the keep.\n\nSoldiers patrol the five walls. More are posted outside. Their uniform is naval, prioritizing movement with cloth pants and leather boots. Royal blue, no less. The vast majority only wear light leather protection, although you do see some with shiny steel breastplates. The officers, if you had to guess. While the keep\u2019s gate is raised, a guard stops you from entering.\n\n\u201cHalt,\u201d he commands, holding a tanned hand up, palm facing toward you. \u201cWhat business do you have in the Crow\u2019s Nest?\u201d\n\nA fitting name for a keep overlooking the entire island. You know it\u2019s based on a ship, but the mention of \u201ccrow\u201d is oddly fitting, like a quiet confirmation you\u2019re on the correct path.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re searching for a man. A man picked up by one of your lord\u2019s ships,\u201d Morgan explains.\n\n\u201cAnd you think we just give out records to anyone who walks up demanding it?\u201d the guard questions, raising an eyebrow for emphasis.\n\nYou intervene. \u201cNo, of course not. Not to just \u2018anyone.\u2019 My father is Arroden Scholhart. Heard of him? The man we pursue is of great interest to my father, and he is willing to pay well should the information from the records pan out.\u201d\n\nMorgan\u2019s face darkens for a moment, then returns back to its blank state. No doubt she\u2019s gauging if you\u2019re lying or not. The guard does the same, but isn\u2019t willing to risk offending the son of a renown gladiator school, even if the house does lie in another nation. Along with wealth, that profession is typically paired with a short fuse.\n\n\u201cRight this way then, young master,\u201d the guard answers, motioning to the open gate. You stride ahead, first, in front of Morgan.", "action_results": [{"action": "Reach out", "result": "The sight, your new-found power from the temple, tingles. It\u2019s the feeling on your skin when static energy is in the air, like the hairs on your arm are standing up. Something about the man calls to you. A secret that wants to be shared, but is too afraid to be spoken. For the second time in your life, you draw on that power.\n\nYour vision darkens, transitioning to a dark purple, then to a deep black. Wind, clouds, smoke. At once, they rush through your sight as if you\u2019re falling from a clifftop, only in a horizontal direction. Your body isn\u2019t physically moving, but your mind races through...wherever this is at an alarming pace. You pick up speed, rushing to a level where your eyes begin to dry, causing a build-up of tears in response. As the tears roll down your cheeks, your movement is suddenly halted.\n\nThe man, the guard floats next to you, unseen by the people before you. Like previous visions, you\u2019re able to survey the scene before you from above, lightlessly floating. This time, however, the guard is the same as you. A child, the younger version of the guard sits at a crudely constructed table, an older man next to him. His father, if you had to guess.\n\nThe man addresses the child. \u201cSon, we need money, and the navy is willing to pay it. I know things have been difficult since your mother...left us, but this is the best thing for us. Can you be a good boy and tend to the horses for me?\u201d\n\nThe kid nods. \u201cYes, Father. Do you really have to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t serve in the navy from the comfort of your living room. I\u2019ll be back. Promise. Six months tops.\u201d\n\nWith that, the older man gets up and places a kiss on the child\u2019s, the guard\u2019s, forehead. After a reassuring squeeze of the shoulder, he exits the home.

He doesn\u2019t speak, but a quick head motion signals follow me. The keep\u2019s courtyard is lined with a sandy brick, the stones closely aligned as to create a smooth floor. Tristrand\u2019s men don\u2019t show it, but you know every eye is on you and Morgan. The Crow\u2019s Nest doesn\u2019t seem to get many visitors. A quick march takes you to the keep\u2019s main doors, a pair of sturdy wooden things reinforced with cross beams of steel. The march takes you inside.\n\nDeep blue greets you upon entering. The floor is dyed a dark, ocean blue like the color of water with low depth, the color of water where unseen, undocumented predators swim, where few explore and survive. Instead of being taken directly to the throne room where you can speak to the king, you\u2019re brought to a separate chamber, not far off from the main doors.\n\nIt\u2019s a small room. Only enough room for two rickety chairs behind a desk assembled from driftwood. The desktop is mostly flat, although different colored and shaped driftwood sometimes jut out in weird spots, one of which is directly in the center like an antler was nailed to the desk.\n\n\u201cI get the feeling we\u2019re not about to meet the king,\u201d you whisper to Morgan. She silently agrees with what looks like a borderline pout.\n\nThe door to the room opens and slams just as quickly. A portly man enters, red beard running down at the edges of his face, though not quite completing the connection to a thin moustache. Despite his loose clothing, rolls of fat move with each movement, which are surprisingly dexterous for someone of his size. He slams down a massive leather book on the table, creating a similar sound to the door shutting. The book narrowly misses the desk antler, or in this case, pike.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re searching for a man. What makes you think we give out records to the public?\u201d the man says, fashioning a pair of tiny glasses to his nose, the frames barely wider than his pupils.\n\n\u201cJustice,\u201d Morgan answers. \u201cThe man we seek is a murderer. He killed our...teacher. One of your vessels picked him up from an unnamed island.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd just who do you think you are? Taking the law into your own hands. The punishment for murder is a death at sea,\u201d the portly man replies. Seeing your confusion, he continues. \u201cWhy bother the hangman when a heavy rock, rope, and deep waters are at your disposal?\n\n\u201cNo arguments here,\u201d you answer. \u201cBut still, in order to uphold the king\u2019s law, you need to locate the murderer first. Think of it as our civic duty, helping to locate a criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas, no,\u201d the man says, readjusting his glasses. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we cannot allow every vengeance-seeker to carry out his deeds, no matter how \u2018righteous.\u2019 Leave me a description of the man, and I will make sure our men are on the look-out. There are two of you claiming witness to his crime. That\u2019s good. Along with a description, leave your names and residence. We\u2019ll contact you once he\u2019s brought in.

We\u2019ll know more once you leave a description of the man. My lord\u2019s waters are vast, spanning the majority of the sea. There are many unnamed islands such as the one you claim to have come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not some fairy tale,\u201d Morgan answers. \u201cWe can show you the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, that will not do either. If you have the coordinates of the island along with the date you think one of my lord\u2019s ships picked up this man, then that will narrow our search. I really must be going. Leave the information on the parchment I left on the table, and see yourselves out. Good day.\u201d\n\nThe portly man slips out of the small room, making it seem less small. As you sit up to write on the parchment, Morgan stops you. \u201cHe\u2019s hiding something.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople in his position are always hiding something,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cYes, but he knows something about Joren.\u201d Morgan spits the man\u2019s name with obvious distaste. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait to get out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because he doesn\u2019t want to spend his time with us doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s actively aiding Joren\u2019s escape...but he did seem rather shifty, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. And I plan to find out what he knows.\u201d\n\nSomehow you don\u2019t think Morgan\u2019s decision involves holding to King Tristrand\u2019s laws.", "action_results": [{"action": "Done here", "result": "You and Morgan leave the Crow\u2019s Nest and journey back to the main hub of Lune. Part of you knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy to waltz into a king\u2019s keep and demand information, but the other part naively believed you would find the information you sought after. Back to the winding streets you go, searching for a place to reconvene and plan your next steps.\n\nThe streets are packed with citizens and shops. A place such as this relies heavily on importing and exporting goods to survive. While King Tristrand\u2019s territory may be large, the amount of land mass is on the smaller side. Food, clothing, even jewelry needs to be brought in from other lands. It\u2019s no wonder that the streets are constantly abuzz with sale. The same street vendors and peddlers yell towards you as you walk past, promising their goods will change your life. One comment about \u201csprucing up the bedroom\u201d with their product earns a nasty look from Morgan.\n\nSuddenly, the crowd seems to move as one, parting down the center like the crease of a leather-bound book. Blue uniforms appear. Soldiers from King Tristrand\u2019s navy rush past in a thunderous stomping of boots and heavy breathing. The climb from the docks isn\u2019t a short one, and, well, it\u2019s a climb to reach the Crow\u2019s Nest.\n\nUnlike a coordinated march, the soldiers in royal blue run scattered, allowing for the faster ones to not be held back by the slower. Still, none are slow, just some slower than others. A mix between soldier and sailor, Tristrand\u2019s naval men are built with lean muscle from manning their vessels. A ship can only hold a limited amount of food, so the soldiers need to condition their body to work without an excess of nutrition.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think that\u2019s about?\u201d you ask Morgan shortly after the final blue uniform passes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d she answers. \u201cIn the meantime, we have work to do. I don\u2019t intend to leave this place without answers. We need to find an inn and gather some equipment.\u201d\n\n\u201cEquipment for what?\u201d you question, fully knowing the answer.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m not leaving here without answers, and they\u2019re sitting behind lock and key in the Crow\u2019s Nest. Ready to put your training to the test?\u201d\n\n\u201cI made it through your instruction. This should be easy in comparison.\u201d\n\nYour reply earns you a smirk from Morgan.

She takes off down the street, walking with purpose. That\u2019s not normally the way you\u2019d describe a person\u2019s steps, but hers are intentional, deliberate, straight-forward. There\u2019s no swaying of the arms or casually glance side-to-side with her head. She\u2019s heading towards a destination as if wearing blinders, ignoring the noise around her. Strange woman. Beautiful woman. Deadly woman.\n\nFinally, you\u2019re alone. Somehow it feels relaxing without the constant eyes of Morgan upon you. Not that you\u2019re at odds, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t quite feel like allies yet. You\u2019re thrust together by necessity. A man lies dead, a temple destroyed in the process, and the blame lies mostly with you, at least according to Morgan. The crow on your arm, the tattoo burned into your skin signifying the Lady\u2019s mark: it\u2019s the only reason why you\u2019re still breathing. Joren was to be executed when Morgan and Killian first captured you, and what happened? You saved his life. You wonder what would have been, should you have stood back and let Joren die.\n\nNo. That\u2019s not who you are. Weak men stand idly, too afraid to act. True, your act may have, in a sense, doomed Killian and the order, but the blame lies with Joren and his decision. You can\u2019t be at fault for that, despite what Morgan may think. If she needs to view you as the object of her blame, so be it. You can\u2019t change that.\n\nWalking in thought, you end up staring at a sign post marked SEA BREEZE. Showing signs of blue and white paint, it\u2019s almost completely void of its original color. In fact, if you shut one eye, it reads E R EZE. Looks as nice a place as any to rest your head. Not really, but the few crowns Morgan placed in your hand will cover room and food for a few nights. The door opens with a creak, and you head inside the dimly-lit building.\n\nWooden tables sit in various places of the inn in no apparent position, besides being spaced out far enough that listening ears would have trouble tuning in. From the doorway, the entire right side of the inn is one long bar, holding positions for both stools and standing patrons. Behind the bar, a hearth lies cold and dead, likely only fired up during cold nights. Speaking of patrons, there are none, which you\u2019re unsure if that\u2019s a good or bad thing.\n\n\u201cAre you gunna stand there or buy somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\nAn old man missing a few teeth yells at you from behind the bar. His hands are busy cleaning a mug with a rag that looks as if it could use a nice washing. The same goes for the old man. You approach the bar, wooden floorboards settling in as you walk. Your palm slams down on the bar top, and upon retraction, two crowns appear.\n\n\u201cI need a room for a few nights. How\u2019s the cook?\u201d\n\nThe man nods, swiping the coins into his hand. \u201cBest I ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the ale?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven better.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrder me up his best dish then.

Wearing the brown robes of a scholar, an elderly man approaches you.\n\n\u201cYoung Master, you need to be careful. It\u2019s a long ways down from here, and cleaning your blood from the sand would put a nasty ache in my back,\u201d the elderly man says.

Darkness consumes you. Cold air, like that of a morning, fills your lungs. You\u2019re being taken somewhere. As if a torch lit in a cave, brightness returns, and you see a new scene before you. It\u2019s still a younger version of yourself, although much older than the kid at the balcony, mid-to-late teen if you had to guess the age.\n\nYou\u2019re sitting at your father\u2019s table. Plates of food are spread out in front of you, much more than two people could ever eat. More than a family of four could ever eat, realistically. You eat quietly, allowing your father, Arroden, to speak with the man standing at the doorway. The man, chained at the wrists and dressed in a loincloth, leaves no imagination to his hardened muscle built by combat. He stands attentively towards your father. Several guards are posted in the room, armed with short swords and tower shields, should the man decide to act disobediently.\n\nIt\u2019s a scene well in your memory. The man, your father\u2019s champion, felling countless opponents in the arena, a god in the world of gladiators, standing before your father stuffing his face with comforts and honeyed wine. Yet, the champion is but a pet to Arroden Scholhart, doing his bidding, completing his every command. It\u2019s similar to the way a warhorse is tied, a single strap of leather binding it to a flimsy post. It has the strength to revolt. It can crush a man before its feet. But still, it attends to the master\u2019s bidding.\n\nWhy did you leave?\n\nThat voice, familiar in sound, speaks to you. Next to you, floating alongside, is the woman from your dreams, the one whose mark you bear. The woman flocked by crows, her bright hair barely touching her shoulders, seeming to float above them, despite the length going down her back. The sharp features of her face look at you questioningly, although you have a feeling she knows the answer. She just wants to hear it from you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve replayed this scene in my mind countless times,\u201d you say, willing, wanting to say the answer the woman seeks. \u201cThe imbalance of power planted a seed in my head. How is it that a man of strength is so easily controlled?\u201d\n\nPhysical strength can only take you so far. The mind, your will, is what separates the strong from the weak.\n\n\u201cBy the same token, chains can only limit you so much.\u201d\n\nThe woman smiles. Warmth rushes over you, as if stepping out from cool shade into the morning sun.\n\n\u201cThe seed grew,\u201d you continue. \u201cIt grew into a bitter-tasting fruit tree.

You stand not 200 feet out, surveying its defenses and guard patrols. All it took was an hour, give or take, to learn the patterns of the night watch. You and Morgan are more interested in the guards patrolling the walls. Those on the ground level are stationary, their only movement lies in a shift or finding a place to relieve themselves. Nearby barracks house more security, ready at a moment\u2019s notice. It\u2019s dark. The keep stands still and powerful, only lit by torches every 20-30 paces.\n\n\u201cReady to put your training to the test?\u201d Morgan whispers.\n\n\u201cAfter you, Milady,\u201d you whisper back, sarcastically bowing.\n\n\u201cEnough of that. Follow me.\u201d\n\nMorgan steps out from your cover, an outcropping of trees, crouched, and sneaks towards the walls. You follow, keeping light on your feet. Your gaze goes down, more concerned with stepping on a stray twig or leaf, rather than the guards patrolling the keep. With Morgan in the lead, you\u2019re certain she\u2019ll stop you before straying too close to anyone.\n\n\u201cHold a moment,\u201d she whispers, hand finding a spot on your chest to physically drive home her point. On the wall in front of you, the glow of a torch passes by, its radius of light slowly fading back into darkness. \u201cHook,\u201d Morgan commands.\n\nSilently, you pull the grappling hook from your belt and begin to swing it in a circle, gathering momentum for the throw. Your left hand loosens on the rope, while your right releases on the upswing. Allowing the attached rope to travel between your loose grip, you watch the hook fly high, dropping just barely over the wall, where it lands with a soft clank. You both hold still, listening for reaction, before starting the climb. Not hearing a response from any guards, Morgan begins the climb, you closely behind.\n\nAtop the wall you\u2019re still in darkness. Staying in one place too long will eventually result in a guard discovering your location. As you pull up the rope and attach the hook back to your belt, you wait for Morgan\u2019s directions. She eyes the blueprint, quickly rolling it open to check your whereabouts. Satisfied, she rolls the parchment back up points the direction in which to travel. Off in the distance, you spot a guard coming your way. Knowing this would likely happen, the both of you swing your legs over the wall, and lower yourselves down, your fingertips the only section of your bodies visible over the edge.\n\nHeavy footsteps draw near, grumbling from the man\u2019s mouth following suit. As the footsteps reach crescendo, you hold your breath, afraid any abnormal sound would draw attention from the guard. As quickly as they approach, the footsteps begin to subside. You and Morgan pull yourselves back over the wall, clenching your fingers into fists a few times to get the blood flow back into your fingertips. A door lies ahead of you, leading into the interior.\n\nInside, patrolling guards are less frequent. Most of the security is spent preventing intruders from getting inside. Besides, anyone breaking in this far has to travel back past the outer defenses. Torches on the walls provide minimal light, dancing shadows in the night. Following the directions from Morgan\u2019s blueprint, you arrive at the unnamed room, the place holding the answers you seek.\n\nThe room is organized chaos. Shelves line the floor and walls, holding countless scrolls piled upon one another like logs to a fire. In some places, hanging shelves descend from the ceiling, providing even more space for scrolls to sit.\n\n\u201cHow in the hell are we supposed to find anything here?\u201d you softly whisper, more to yourself.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s arranged in a pattern.

Do you remember the moon from when Joren...escaped?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Morgan answers, starting to scan the shelves. As Morgan searches, an idea pops into your head. Remembering the royal blue soldiers rushing past, you find the shelf for current reports. It\u2019s not hard to find as it\u2019s the least populated shelf as the moon cycle is not yet complete. Unlike the other scrolls around it, you find a long cylinder tube sitting on top of the pile, a case designed to protect its contents. You pull the tube and pop the lid open, sending the report into your awaiting hand. You unroll the scroll and place it on a nearby reading table.\n\nIt brings news from the west.

The old schooner and he had been paired together for almost five years now. She\u2019s a pretty boat. By far Rotha\u2019s favorite command. It wasn\u2019t special by any means. It wasn\u2019t the speediest. It didn\u2019t pack the most firepower, but damn, was she nimble. Captain Rotha could guide her, shifting directions, as if a dance partner in his arms.\n\nCaptain Rotha stood at the helm, watching his crew working their tasks. His crew. He liked the sound of that. His eyes found a young lad, not more than 16, bringing a bucket of water and brush to the ship\u2019s railing. Rotha\u2019s mind traveled back to when he was in that position. King Tristrand\u2019s territory didn\u2019t house many families of nobility. Good thing, too. Each man had the opportunity to rise naval rank by accolade, rather than family name. In Rotha\u2019s experience, the best leaders are ones with humble beginnings, who know what it\u2019s like to put himself in the common soldier\u2019s boots.\n\nHis voyage wasn\u2019t an uncommon one. Sail west to the straight, travel north along the Helswith coast, and finally west, along the northern border of the Helswith. The voyage took him on a loop, sailing around the perimeter of King Tristrand\u2019s waters. As far as scenery goes, it wasn\u2019t the prettiest journey, not counting the ocean. Blue skies, even bluer water, sparking, shimmering, reflecting sunlight like torchlight on a pile of sapphires.\n\nThe land mass, though, wasn\u2019t pretty by any means. Traveling along the coast of the Helswith, mostly desert, didn\u2019t afford much to look at. Dry hills, void of color, stand between the ocean and the desert sand. Ironically enough, the Helswith beaches were mostly rock, despite the territory holding an abundance of sand. Most of the crew, Captain Rotha included, kept their eyes on the sea. The people of the Helswith can have their lifeless hills and sand; King Tristrand\u2019s men would take the comforting waves of the sea.\n\nAlong the northern coast of Helswith, The Seaspell was drawing very close to the end of King Tristrand\u2019s waters. Traveling west, they reached the border of Helswith as well, a three-pronged meeting place where King Tristrand, the Helswith Desert, and the barbarian plains of the west intersect: Trident\u2019s Point.\n\n\u201cCaptain!\u201d a voice shouted from the crow\u2019s nest, pointing towards the land. Occupied by a young man, youth brought the spryness needed to climb up to the nest at a quick pace. \u201cThere\u2019s a battle on the Point!\u201d\n\nCaptain Rotha drew his eyeglass from his pocket, dusting off the lens for a clear picture. Sure enough, the kid was right. The army of High Lord Ursa was easy to recognize. Their silver and gold armor glinted from sunlight, like the deadly flash of a throwing knife. But who were their enemies? The barbarian tribes of the west don\u2019t have numbers to engage High Lord Ursa in a clash of armies; when not infighting, they stick to small raids on stray travelers and towns. It\u2019s never a full, direct confrontation. Still, Captain Rotha knew what he saw. A great number of tribes, barbarians banding together to create an army, one that would outnumber High Lord Ursa if all joined together: a horde.\n\n\u201cPull her around, we make straight for the king!\u201d Captain Rotha commanded, spinning the helm with all his might. Around him, the crew scattered to their duties, not a single hand could be idle. The horde posed no threat to King Tristrand. They had no ships, no navy to threaten the king. The islands of King Tristrand were heavily reliant on the import of goods to keep their lifestyle. If Helswith falls, thinks Captain Rotha nervously, then King Tristrand is directly affected. A shortage of goods might cause people to revolt. Some might even make deals with the horde to secure their own future.\n\nNo, the survival of Helswith is strictly tied with King Tristrand. Captain Rotha knew it, High Lord Ursa knew it, and King Tristrand knew it.", "action_results": [{"action": "News of Joren", "result": "\u201cHere it is.

A last minute guard change almost results in your capture. As soon as you exited the keep, you found yourself face-to-face with a rather unhappy-looking guard, obviously just woken up and definitely not expecting to find intruders. Your fist smashing his nose certainly didn\u2019t improve his mood, although at least it put him back to sleep. Securing the grappling hook, you traverse back down the side of the keep\u2019s wall. Not an hour later, you find yourself back in the Sea Breeze room.\n\nYou collapse, cross-legged, and pull your waterskin from your things, taking several gulps. After being deprived of a healthy amount of water, you\u2019ve learned to take advantage while you can, noticing the benefits of keeping hydrated and the direct effect it has on physical toil.

Are you saying because I\u2019m a woman you expect civility and dainty sipping of tea cups?\u201d\n\n\u201cCivility, sure,\u201d you answer, this time choosing your words more strategically. \u201cI expect that from everyone. But you...you\u2019re different. Strength flows through you. It guides you. It\u2019s like nothing seems impossible to you. I mean, this journey we\u2019re on? Not many would go through the lengths you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what of you?\u201d Morgan asks, turning her full attention towards your seated figure. \u201cYou\u2019re on the same path. Do you intend to feed from my strength as if a parasite to a hunter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I...It\u2019s not fear that keeps me here. Without a doubt, you would have killed me if I refused to come. I didn\u2019t accompany simply to save my life. Do you know where I come from?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYou were a slave, unless, in fact, you weren\u2019t lying to that guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t. My family is one of the wealthiest in the Helswith. Wealth, comfort, it has a way of deteriorating a man, making him stretch the use of that title. The gladiators in my father\u2019s employ, they could defeat any of my father\u2019s guards, but why don\u2019t they? Why don\u2019t they revolt for a better, humane way of life? Their strength lies in their physical body. They\u2019re nothing but mindless tools, doing the bidding of whatever my father seems fit. Strength of body, strength of mind: there\u2019s a very real difference to the two. One alone doesn\u2019t cut it; only the truly strong possess both. I left to see if I had that strength, the very same one you embody.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still uncertain,\u201d you answer, honestly.\n\nMorgan walks toward you, crouching where you sit.

Many times, you\u2019ve been the object of her wrath, of her hands-on discipline. This time, the touch is gentle, soothing, comforting. Her open palm rests on your chest, feeling the steady beat of your heart. Eyes still meeting yours, she speaks.\n\n\u201cThe Lady provides both.

High Lord Ursa wouldn\u2019t dare issue such a command without absolutely needing the men. It was not his place to dispute directives; Pralthar\u2019s place was to follow them. The same could be said for the arriving slaves. Imagining the future, thinking through possible outcomes was nothing new for the squadleader. It\u2019s something that needs to be done before each battle. Slaves, while possessing the ability to follow an order, were prone to seek escape.

The Reapers are formatted in an upside down V shape, with Paxson at the point, the rest of the soldiers behind him in a line on either side of him. The front is the most dangerous position, even more so with an unknown ally at your back.\n\nSmall skirmishes such as this one became a common occurrence.

His buckler knocks a wild axe swing aside, creating an opening for his spear. Before he can take advantage, Paxson\u2019s instincts urge him to dodge to the right. In a roll, a short throwing spear flies harmlessly through the air where Paxson once stood, bouncing from a Reaper\u2019s tower shield behind Paxson.\n\nAs the thrower struggles to draw his weapon, Paxson lunges forward, thrusting the point of his spear through the man\u2019s chest.

The fact those savages can even stand next to one another without slaughtering each other is a miracle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh, apparently you think you know of the horde. Then why did you ask where all the people were?\u201d the beggar retorts, scratching at a beard far past the regular grooming stage.\n\n\u201cEnough of this. I have no time for games,\u201d Morgan answers, starting to walk down the street. As you turn to follow, a strong grip wraps around your wrist twisting your forearm open. In a blink, your sleeve is rolled up to expose the tattoo, the one placed by the Lady herself.\n\n\u201cInteresting ink you have there, traveler,\u201d the beggar says, articulating his speech much clearer than before. \u201cSome would call it a blessing, others a curse.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you call it?\u201d you ask, allowing the man to keep his grip. If he turns violent, you are ready, but you won\u2019t be the first to escalate things. What\u2019s the honor in striking a beggar, especially landing the first blow?\n\n\u201cDepends on who bears it,\u201d he answers. \u201cA blessing to some, a curse to others. It\u2019s relative, depending on who you ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou speak in circular riddles. We\u2019ve come back to the very beginning. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re after, but you\u2019ll not make a jest of me,\u201d you say, twisting your arm from his hold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised one bound by shackles is uncomfortable with a firm grip on the arm. I grow tired of your presence. Leave me be,\u201d the beggar replies, waving his hand at you as if batting a fly, a nuisance away.\n\nStrange way to end a conversation, even more so when you remember he was the one initiating it. Your past is no secret to those with the ability to interpret, not just with a seer\u2019s sight either. Scars at your wrist point to either slavery or incarceration. The tattoo, while mysteriously appearing, draws eyes as most markings do, self-imposed or otherwise. See. The words spoken by the Lady resonate in your mind. You must be made to see. Still, you have little experience in the matter. \u201cSeeing\u201d goes both ways.

A streak of blue reaches down from the sky, crackling with electric energy, the heavens otherwise dark, filled with black storm clouds.

It\u2019s the place of your training.\n\nAround you, the landscape lies dead. Where a green treeline once surrounded, black, jagged trunks stand, void of leaves. Their bark is blackened, burned. Silent they stand, surrounding you, no sign of life. The largest one stands directly in front of you. Its scarred remains bear a resemblance to the willow tree.\n\nYou begin to approach the willow tree. Then you discover a man squatting beneath it. He\u2019s crouched low on the balls of his feet, resting his arms on his knees. His body has a slight sway to it, like leaves in the wind. As you draw closer, the dark hair on the man slowly fades from color, transitioning to a snowy white. You realize his hair wasn\u2019t actually black; it was dyed and filled with soot.\n\nThe man turns at your presence, motioning for you to sit next to him. You take a seat beneath the scarred tree. Still staring forward, the man speaks.\n\n\u201cDeath. The death of our home, the death of the order, the death of me. All caused by you.\u201d\n\nKillian.\n\n\u201cCaused by Joren,\u201d you correct.\n\n\u201cWho rescued his life? From that moment, his actions were your responsibility.

It all lies on Joren.\u201d\n\nYour words don\u2019t seem to sit well with the man, with the image of Killian. His head slowly turns your direction, moving focus away from the dead willow.

The animal, a mirshka, is carrying more than its weight on its carapace-like back and struggles in defiance at its owner\u2019s direction, firmly stomping its six hooves into the ground. Strange. There are not many who can slip from your detection, especially after training on the island.\n\n\u201cGods,\u201d Morgan curses. \u201cThat must have been a member of the Dreamwalkers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe who?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cThe Dreamwalkers, or Walkers. Rivals of sorts. No, \u2018rival\u2019 implies some level of shared ground. They are enemies of the Lady, seeking to disrupt her work. Killian must have mentioned the war with you. Well, it\u2019s with them.\u201d\n\nShe continues explaining as you approach a horse trader. The man stands behind a row of horses, displaying the individual animals, each with their own small stable. His curved hat, made of straw, curls down to his shoulders, protecting him from the Helswith heat. He calmly twirls one end of his dark moustache as you approach. Ignoring the man, you listen to Morgan.\n\n\u201cThe war is not a traditional one. Not in the sense of simply killing one another. There\u2019s a much deeper goal. Killing is easy. Walkers seek to harvest our power\u2026one they share to a degree, but not like ours. Theirs is a watered-down version, attained with magical artifacts. To the commoner, it\u2019s the same, but to us it\u2019s an abomination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not just kill them?\u201d you ask, watching Morgan place coins into the horse trader\u2019s palm. \u201cWhat do you seek from them?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowledge,\u201d she answers. \u201cImagine if we could enhance the Lady\u2019s work with the artifacts they bear. Our few numbers would mean nothing. And I know your next question. No, using the artifacts isn\u2019t the abomination. It\u2019s using the Lady\u2019s gifts against her will that\u2019s the true sin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, I\u2019ll ask: Why not just kill them? You could take the artifacts from their bodies.\u201d\n\nMorgan sighs, casually directing the horse trader to throw saddles on the newly-purchased animals. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Each is somehow tied to the user. When the body dies, the artifact crumbles to dust. There\u2019s a reason why the order keeps a low number. Certainly there would be strength if more were trained, but that\u2019s a double-edged sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore numbers means more potentially harvested by the Dreamwalkers,\u201d you comment. \u201cAiding the order could mean directly aiding the Walkers.\u201d\n\nMorgan nods. \u201cExactly. Killian is fond of keeping it at two. It used to be much higher, tens, even hundreds of members at one point. With a population that high, it\u2019s hard to truly know each one. Where do you think the Dreamwalkers came from? A tainted sect of the order, only they didn\u2019t master the initiation rite. It\u2019s more than a ceremonial graduation. It\u2019s when the Lady blesses us with her power. Two is where Killian liked to keep it. We\u2019ve had up to five at one point. That\u2019s still a manageable number. But the order has thrived the best when only holding two.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less of an order, and more like a couple,\u201d you say, intending to point at the quantity, rather than the relational meaning of the word.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas,\u201d Morgan says, pulling herself on her horse.

All were more than a few deep at that point, the hazel-eyed man more than the rest. It wasn\u2019t anything too unfamiliar, although the lesser amount of guards have resulted in alteration escalation on a few occasions, this being one of them. \u201cWithout none of them shiny spears, men got nothin\u2019 to fear,\u201d the barkeep said.\n\nEverything was running smoothly. Sure, the night\u2019s patrons were a little more indulged than normal, but that\u2019s good for business. Talk of the war overtook the place. It started as mere rumblings, men discussing the most recent news from the western border.\n\n\u201cThat topic is always on everyone\u2019s tongue,\u201d according to the barkeep. \u201cHard not to think of it with the streets bein\u2019 this empty. The men left behind, that weren\u2019t recruited for the High Lord\u2019s army, are all essential to the economic well-being of the nation. They\u2019re craftsmen, mostly. Possessing skills above the commoner. Too important to allow their brains to spill from their skull on the western front. Me? I\u2019m the most important of them all. Their well-being relies on me!\u201d\n\nYou had to politely get the man back on track.\n\n\u201cOne night, the boys were getting a little patriotic. The hazel-eyed man had been here before. More than a few times, actually. He never speaks to anyone. Just drinks silently at the end of the bar, back in the corner. Normal discussion of the war effort took place. Soon, it built into a love for king and country. All were getting in on it, except the hazel-eyed man of course. He soon joined, though. Just not in the same way as the others. In fact, it was the exact opposite. Insults started being hurled at the \u2018New Great Warlord,\u2019 the one who united all the tribes. Reports say he\u2019s a direct descendant of the one of old. Well, at least they say he claims that.

It\u2019s near the end of the week, approaching on the holy day. That and Hedges closed shop early this week. Maven, proud owner and the tavern\u2019s sole employee, somehow avoided being pulled into the High Lord\u2019s army, the thought causing him to scratch at his lengthy sideburns. Hedges, who the place was appropriately named after, wasn\u2019t quite as lucky. And so, all of the regulars at Hedges became regulars at Tankard and Cheer.\n\nTankard and Cheer wasn\u2019t fancy by any means. The interior was filled with pine and similar light wooden furniture. Several pillars, looking too thin to handle structural weight, were spread out over the floor, seven of them total. Maven always got nervous when larger folk leaned on them. Whoever designed the building must have thought they looked regal. Maven can\u2019t think of another reason for the inefficient beams.\n\nA man in the corner, one with distinguished hazel eyes, raised a finger up, signaling for Maven. The barkeep strode over to the man, two tankards in his hand. Part of keeping regulars was to learn their mannerisms, to learn their consumption methods. You needed to anticipate their requests. This man in particular had come in every day for the past three, always ordering the same. First, something strong. Then, two ales. He tipped well, which is why Maven was extra certain to serve the man with a high level of service.\n\nTwo tankards landed with a thud in front of the man, hazel eyes falling upon them with thirst, hands closely following.\n\n\u201cGood to see you again, friend,\u201d Maven said.\n\n\u201cGood to be seen,\u201d the man answered, reaching for the closest ale. A little froth spilled down the side of the tankard onto the bar top.\n\nMaven pulled a rag from his apron pocket and began wiping. \u201cNew in town? I don\u2019t mean to pry. We rarely see travelers now, you know. With the border disputes going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that won\u2019t go on for much longer,\u201d the man replied between sips. Behind Maven, a pair of loud voices rose above the noise of the tavern. After a few ale-induced insults are thrown towards the \u201csavages from the western plains,\u201d ale-induced laughter closely follows.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just blowin\u2019 off steam,\u201d Maven said. \u201cThe war\u2019s putting pressure on their work. Even more so with most of their help recruited into the High Lord\u2019s army. They\u2019re decent folk, just feeling the burden of the conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cHA HA HA! I would give the \u2018Great\u2019 Warlord some of this!\u201d Again, their shouts broke through the typical tavern noise. The man who raised his opinion so subtly, gestured towards his codpiece in a manner of equal subtlety.\n\n\u201cThey bring dishonor on themselves,\u201d the hazel-eyed man spoke, more to his tankard than Maven, who assumed it was directed at him. \u201cThey\u2019re not warriors; they\u2019re the children left behind at war, while true men fight.\u201d\n\nAnother gesture is shown, this one having to do with flipping around an imaginary Great Warlord and riding him from behind, one hand swaying in the air as if trying to tame a wild horse.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just--\u201d Maven started to explain, before the hazel-eyed man slammed down his second tankard. A hand, gently, but with enough force, pushed Maven out of the man\u2019s walking path. The hand transitioned the message well as any words could. Maven knew the man held no grudge against him, but an attempt to get in way would instantly ally himself with the shouting men. Holy flame appeared at the hazel-eyed man\u2019s fingertips, a ring of blue searing into the open air.\n\nCalmly, he walked towards the pair of men, a blank expression on his face. His hand curled into a fist, save for the pointer and middle finger. The blue flame swirled around the two outstretched fingers like clouds at the top of a mountain. As if a sword thrusting in and out from a victim, two fingers, lit by holy flame, slid in and out from one of the men\u2019s temples, dropping him to the floor.\n\nThe tavern noise grinded to a halt, all the inhabitants turning to the hazel-eyed man. The blue flame spreaded to both palms, one outstretching to grip the remaining man\u2019s throat, fingers clamped around the throat, holy flame burning the skin. Screaming, the man tried to release the hazel-eyed man\u2019s grip, only to burn his hands on the holy flame. He collapsed next to his drinking partner.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d the hazel-eyed man, Joren, spoke with a low tone. \u201cAny other \u2018patriots\u2019 feel like voicing their opinions?\u201d\n\nMaven thought it meant to be rhetorical, especially with two bodies at the hazel-eyed man\u2019s feet.

Of the Nameless.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the councilor starts, \u201cand you just spoke of being of Helswith. Which is it then?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Nameless", "result": "You answer, choosing your words with care. \u201cHelswith may be my place of birth, but it is no longer my home. I was once of the house of Scholhart. My name, title, even inheritance was made forfeit with my departure, which was many years ago. I am of the Nameless.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d the councilor comments. \u201cI am well aware of the sudden departure of young Master Scholhart. It\u2019s not every day a great house\u2019s firstborn disappears. So that\u2019s where you went. The Mountains of the Nameless. Your actions put your father, and his house, in a precarious situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re that naive. An heir. You left your father without an heir. Who would continue his work after his death? Who would manage his business, take care of his employees?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no shortage of ambition in Helswith. I\u2019m sure finding a replacement is easy,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s easy. Harder so, to find one that shares the same vision as your father. The house of Scholhart was put in jeopardy by your decision, and all the lives that associate with it. Luckily, you made your decision early enough before Arroden grew too old.\u201d\n\nThe implication of the statement is known to you.\n\n\u201cThere is a new heir?\u201d you ask.\n\nThe councilor nods. \u201cYou, my Nameless friend, have a younger brother. He\u2019s here in the camp, too. At least the house of Scholhart bore one worthwhile son to bring glory to the High Lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve proven we are no enemies to Helswith. Our debt must be settled with this \u2018fugitive\u2019 as you call him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s awaiting execution, is he not? Allow us to finish the deed for you. Then, we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that,\u201d the councilor answers. \u201cYou see, there is a level of order I must maintain throughout the camp. I can\u2019t let just anyone demand to be executioner, striking down men in the name of vengeance. Chaos would ensue. The good news is you\u2019ll be reunited with your fire-loving friend very soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your meaning?\u201d Morgan asks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be kept here until I decide what to do with you. If you are Nameless, then I can\u2019t conscript you, legally, into the High Lord\u2019s army. Then again, your previous familial ties are no small matter. Likely, I will send a message to Arroden and inquire for his thoughts. Perhaps he has one last lesson to teach his firstborn son.\u201d The councilor finishes by rapping his knuckles on his desk.\n\nThe knock causes soldiers to rush into the tent\u2019s interior. These ones are unlike the ones encountered at the camp\u2019s outskirts. Their plate armor is a shiny silver, trimmed with gold. While the mainhand of each carries various weapons, they all bear a sizable shield. The royal guard, if you had to guess. Elites.\n\n\u201cNow, will you kindly escort these two to their quarters?\u201d the councilor asks.\n\nYour hand reaches for your sword, but then is stopped. Morgan\u2019s hand rests at your wrist, keeping you from drawing the blade. She shakes her head, and you understand her thoughts. You may not be arriving as expected, but you\u2019ve finally found Joren. Shackles clamp around your wrists, bringing back memories of the past. You\u2019re meeting Joren the same way as you did originally. Bound by chain.", "action_results": [{"action": "Bound by chain", "result": "The familiar feeling of cold steel around your wrists. The Helswith elite guard escorts you from the councilor\u2019s tent. Back into the hot Helswith air, they lead you through several makeshift streets lined with collapsible structures to a large open area. A simple wooden fence as the perimeter, many cages fill the entire space, pressed against one another. By your estimate, each cage is holding eight to ten prisoners inside, although the proximity of each jail cell makes it look as if it\u2019s one huge enclosure. Luckily, the Helswith soldiers don\u2019t seem too hell-bent on separating prisoners by male and female, so both you and Morgan are \u201cpolitely\u201d placed into the same cell.\n\nStripped of your weapons and armor, you wear a simple loose tunic and trousers, Morgan the same. The other prisoners in the cell glance at you as you\u2019re thrown in, then quickly avoid making eye contact. Conditioned not to stare. You\u2019re accustomed to such behavior by those in shackles. Hell, you experienced the same thing on the boat that eventually crashed into the island. Eye contact is seen as a threat. One that is punished severely by those holding the whip, often extending between prisoners themselves. The result is a frightened bunch, hardly capable of mustering a revolt. Or so the slavers on the boat thought. Still, you recognize the storm created more of an opening than the prisoners did themselves. If the storm never hit, you\u2019d probably still be chained to that damn oar.\n\n\u201cWhy did you have us surrender like that?\u201d you whisper once the cell door slams shut.\n\n\u201cSurrender?\u201d Morgan asks. \u201cI had that pomous man place us exactly where our prey lies. Even more, he\u2019s locked in a cage unable to run from us any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but in case you didn\u2019t notice, so are we,\u201d you reply.\n\n\u201cAre we?\u201d Morgan, again, asks a question she obviously knows the answer to.\n\nInstead of audibly responding, you raise your hands in a questioning manner, gesturing to the cell walls around you as well.\n\nA small laugh escapes Morgan\u2019s lips. \u201cPlease. It only looks that way. Now to locate our man\u2026\u201d She scans the sea of prisoners around you. After a few seconds, she speaks again. \u201cThere. Five cells over.\u201d\n\nSure enough, five cells to your right, a man with brown curls, far longer than you remember, sits on the ground, leaning against the cell wall for back support. You can almost see a twinkle in his hazel eye as he winks in your direction, noticing who his two newest fellow prisoners are.\n\n\u201cIf our plan was to surprise him, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working,\u201d you comment.\n\n\u201cSurprise?\u201d Morgan asks. You groan inwardly at a third rhetorical question, reminding you of her teaching style on the island. \u201cI\u2019d rather him peer into my eyes as I slide my dagger into his heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. Might be hard to do so from your position. Not only would you need to break free from our cell, you\u2019d have to sneak into Joren\u2019s without alerting the guards or having the other inmates create a scene. He may be within sight, but he\u2019s just outside of our grasp,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d Morgan says. If there\u2019s something she knows, she isn\u2019t sharing it with you. Another sigh escapes your lips. What else were you expecting?

When a passing guard came to drop off rations, one of the prisoners, a man with stringy hair at his sides while balding on top, pointed to the opposite end of the cell. Only once the entire cell\u2019s inmates stood on the far end did the guard place the food down.\n\nThe thing often not shared about prison cells is how dreadfully boring it is. You\u2019ve got nothing but time. Sure, it depends who\u2019s holding you. Violent wardens definitely make one\u2019s stay...interesting. High Lord Ursa\u2019s prison is more the \u201ccivilized\u201d variety. Regular meals are given. The food may taste like dirt, but it\u2019s filling enough.

You have a little brother, and he\u2019s in the war camp.\n\nThere\u2019s also the small matter of war. The horde, biding their time, testing the western frontier for weak points, has not engaged on a full-scale attack quite yet. Whatever they\u2019re waiting for hasn\u2019t happened yet. More troops? Supplies? It can\u2019t be additional troops; they\u2019ve already assembled the largest number since the Great Warlord of old, according to the reports. Suddenly, in the grand scheme of things, your quest for revenge feels very insignificant.\n\nA nation, your place of birth, the Helswith, on the verge of destruction, its impact already being felt by military recruitment. Better not tell Morgan that, though. Her mind, as always, is singular, focused on the task. Focused on the Lady. Deviating from that path may end up with the knifepoint pointed at you after tasting Joren\u2019s blood. Part of you doesn\u2019t think so, but still, you think it safe to hold such thoughts to yourself.

Your cellmates, along with Morgan, are dark forms in the foreground of blackness. For days you\u2019ve sat, imprisoned, Morgan still content where you both are for the time being.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change.\n\nA cold hand lands across your mouth, the face behind it shrouded in black. Morgan. Her other hand motions towards her face, and you barely make out her finger gesturing in front of her lips, the sign to be quiet. You nod, slowly rising from your prone state. Morgan\u2019s finger, still in front of her mouth, pulls an object from underneath her tongue. A small pin, not longer than an inch, rests between her forefinger and thumb, likely something she snagged in the councilor's tent. No wonder she was content. She was biding her time for the perfect moment. A night like this, moonlight hidden, is that exact thing.\n\nShe creeps to the cell door, you closely behind, and maneuvers the pin into the lock, taking care not to jumble it around and alert the others. With a satisfying click, the mechanism releases. You both pause, listening to see if there\u2019s a response from the other prisoners. It\u2019s silent. The two of you slip from your cell into the Helswith air, free.\n\nSuddenly, a burst of light emerges from one end of the camp. A group of soldiers appear, five in total, carrying torches, marching straight for you. How did they know you escaped so quickly? Before the torchlight can land on you, you make a break for the nearest makeshift barracks, a canvas tent designed in a long, rectangular position. In the safety between two of them, you watch the soldiers pass you by. They aren\u2019t coming for you. And you have a good idea who they are coming for. The sentries did say Joren tried burning the camp down. Bound to be some angry Helswith soldiers as a result of that.", "action_results": [{"action": "Watch", "result": "They head straight for Joren\u2019s cell, their torchlight interrupting nearby sleeping prisoners, which react by moving to the end of their cells, obviously wanting no trouble from the soldiers.

A few wrinkles lie on their tunics, and they aren\u2019t tied tight. After throwing a few kicks into Joren\u2019s prone body, they address him again, sure that he\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\n\u201cCome on, gentlemen. You take things too personally.

Nasty thing it was,\u201d Joren says once the kicking stops, which of course causes it to begin again.\n\n\u201cYou damn near burned the skin from his face, savage!\u201d\n\nJoren curls up as more blows hit his body. In the mad rush of feet stomping and occasional fist, you can tell not many blows are actually causing damage. To an untrained eye, it would look as if Joren is beaten half to death. To yours, on the other hand, you notice most of the strikes are absorbed through his arms, often just glancing off to the ground as Joren twists his body in a subtle defensive pattern. The soldiers, intoxicated as they are, simply think he\u2019s squirming in pain. There\u2019s no doubt Morgan is catching it as well.\n\nThen Joren strikes.\n\nHe explodes into a burst of motion, twisting on the ground, sweeping the feet out from under two of the soldiers. His fists, using his shackles as blunt weapons, rain down on them, stopping any sort of movement in their bodies.\n\n\u201cYou really think I need the Divine\u2019s power to handle the likes of a few drunks?\u201d Joren flatly states, more as a fact than threat. \u201cYou\u2019re brutes, cruel masters taking up arms against a \u2018defenseless\u2019 prisoner. I know your kind, never willing to take a fair fight. There\u2019s three of you left. I\u2019ll try to take it easy in fairness.\u201d\n\nJoren engages them in a fury of chained fists. With both hands closely bound, he uses his arms as a single weapon, a mace put together with fist and steel. He blocks left, then right, kicking his leg out to keep the other soldier at distance. The soldiers, slow with drink, are more helpless than Joren was in the center of them. One drops, then another. Then, Joren takes his time with the final one, slamming his fists into the man\u2019s gut doubling him over. A quick knee sends the man sprawling to the ground, where Joren takes a position standing over the man in a mad frenzy of hammer fists. As the man\u2019s face caves in, turning into an unrecognizable mess, only then does Joren quit, taking the man\u2019s key and unlocking the shackles at his wrists.\n\nFive soldiers at his feet, his cell door open, Joren takes off into the night.", "action_results": [{"action": "Follow", "result": "He takes off west, traveling towards the barbarian plains.

It probably wouldn\u2019t have been too hard to catch them unawares. Still, though you find yourself here. There\u2019s a man to kill.\n\nJoren quickly ducks into a nearby tent, a barracks of sorts, likely to search for supplies. Better do the same if you\u2019re going to chase him into the plains. Then, the thought comes across your mind. Why would you chase him into the western plains when he\u2019s in a building not 50 feet away? You\u2019re within striking distance.

They head straight for Joren, the light from their torches interrupting the prisoners of each cell that they pass. The soldier in front of the others reaches in his pocket for a key, digging around for a bit and missing the lock twice before swinging open the cell door.

Blood splashes in the air then down to Joren\u2019s prone body, too much for one man. To your right, Morgan has done the same maneuver, and she\u2019s working on the next one. You do the same, making quick work of the drunken soldiers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll not get away this time,\u201d Morgan speaks to the man before her, the very man who burned the temple and killed her mentor.\n\nJoren looks up from the ground.

That old man of yours was a traitor to your cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour lies mean nothing,\u201d Morgan answers. \u201cI only wish I could make it slower.\u201d Morgan thrusts the dagger down, sending the tip piercing Joren\u2019s chest. A small gurgle escapes his mouth. His hands, still chained, half-heartedly reach towards the blade in his chest, unsure whether to try pulling it out. Either way, he\u2019s doomed. Morgan takes a deep breath and looks up to the night sky, as if in contemplation or looking for divine direction. You stand back a few feet, allowing her to savor the moment. What does this mean for the two of you now?\n\nMen\u2019s voices begin to ring into the night, still a way\u2019s off. Your skirmish must have alerted other soldiers, who are now making their way to your very location. You drop down, searching the leader of the now-dead Helswith men and pull a key from his belt.\n\n\u201cGood luck. You\u2019re better off traveling west, just steer clear of any tribesmen,\u201d you say, tossing the key into the nearest cell. The prisoners inside nod and immediately unlock their door, passing the key to the next and so on. Not many would likely make it, but at least some will. It\u2019s a better chance than you ever received. Deep down, not a prideful thought, but you also know they will cover your own escape, distracting the soldiers away from you.\n\nWith Joren dead, your mission completed, Morgan and you escape into the night.\n\nLouder and louder the camp gets, coming alive in the middle of the night. Prisoner escape. Not that the soldiers would have noticed you and Morgan sneaking through, but the chaotic circumstance makes for a nice cover. Men rush past your various hiding positions, all heading straight for the prison area. Soldiers lie dead, prisoners breaking free, they\u2019re more concerned with stopping a revolt than searching for lone escapees.\n\nYou take the opportunity to snag some equipment on the way out. After finding a soldier your height and build, you\u2019re now armed with simple protective leather and sword at your hip. Morgan\u2019s only able to pick up a sword, as the soldiers you came across wore armor much too big for her. Just as you suggested to the prisoners, you head west into the barbarian plains. Now that you\u2019ve put some distance between you and the camp, you see it\u2019s littered with fires. The prisoners who seemed docile enough, must have made more of an impact than you were expecting. They likely know it\u2019s their one chance at escape and are making the most of it.\n\nIt\u2019s still dark, although the first sign of morning light is starting to appear. A thick cloud layer still hangs in the air, doing its best effort to shield the approaching sunlight.\n\n\u201cFinally.

Perhaps you\u2019re reading into it too much. Joren is dead, and you will start over with Morgan. Things could have ended up worse. Still, though, a tiny part of you doesn\u2019t imagine this is how it was all supposed to end. You\u2019ve only just learned that you have a little brother. And he\u2019s here.

In the moment, a mundane decision, a mundane choice feels exactly that. Insignificant. Looking back, however, you can see how they added up, how they brought you exactly to where you are now.

His effort causes his wounds to spill even more blood on the sand. Waves crash on the shore, highlighting the silence of the soldiers standing before him. They wear the royal blue of King Tristrand. Traitor, abandoning his Helswith allies to support the barbarians of the west.\n\nK\u2019rell, Caius, even the squadleader, Pralthar, lay dead around Paxson, the lone survivor of the beach massacre. Soon he will not be able to make such a boast.\n\nHe can\u2019t help but feel the loss of each squad member. True, he joined the Reapers as a slave. They did not treat him with the respect of a fellow soldier at first. Slowly, battle-by-battle, they began to treat him as one of their own. They recognized him as another member of the squad. Paxson, gladiator, slave to the house of Arroden Scholhart, a member of the Reapers. Not a single one of them would deny that.\n\nPaxson presses his short sword into the sand, using it as a crutch to stand back to his feet. His buckler, once inseparable from his hand, rests harmlessly next to his feet, his off-hand lacking the strength to hold it. Instead, the hand clutches a side-wound, one of many that mark his body.\n\nRise, keep fighting, press forward. The words of past teachers echo in his body. Each wound, each time he\u2019s knocked to the dirt, the words appear, instilled by countless hours of training. Somehow, someway, they always cause him to rise again, this instance for the final time.\n\nIt\u2019s not the sand of the arena beneath his feet, but it\u2019s close enough. It\u2019s the lie believed by any gladiator who\u2019s had some level of success, Paxson among the greatest. Death in the arena, on that sacred sand is the highest honor. It\u2019s a nice lie to believe. For a gladiator it\u2019s either death on the sand or death in chains. With only two choices, might as well choose the honorable one. Here, now, far away from such glories, away from the cheering crowd, Paxson prepares himself for the end, something he\u2019s done each time before stepping into the arena. A quiet, nameless death wasn\u2019t an outcome he imagined.\n\nPaxson charges the soldiers, staggering forward, swinging his sword recklessly, his only strength left an impenetrable will that urges him on, despite his broken body.

After protecting the western front for so long, it finally happened. The main force of High Lord Ursa assembled, it\u2019s marching time. With the strength of the High Lord\u2019s famed chariots, there\u2019s no reason to sit and wait for the horde to strike. It\u2019s time for the Helswith soldiers to take the offensive, no longer playing border patrol. The full might of High Lord Ursa would be felt on the barbarian plains.\n\nBecause of their \u201chonorable\u201d and \u201cnoble\u201d service protecting the western front, the Reapers, along with other similar squads were rewarded with first entry into the plains. The first line of defense soon became the first line of offense. The exact location of the Great Warlord and his horde was still unknown, but that\u2019s one benefit about fighting such a large force: they\u2019re not easily hidden.\n\nThe Reapers took to the northern coast of the plains, attacking supply lines and using their small strike force to catch straggling barbarian groups. Their usual V formation isn\u2019t as effective when surprising the enemy; it\u2019s better suited when engaging a larger attack force. Instead, the Reapers took to a pincer tactic, where they\u2019d cause a roadblock, stopping the supply carts in place, then assault from both sides.\n\nPaxson blocks an axe swing, meeting his buckler with the barbarian weapon, then counters with his own short sword. The blade lands true, a piercing thrust into the tribesman\u2019s chest, quickly retracted in search of another victim. Along the northern coast on bluffs overlooking the sea, three carts sit in a line, their journey blocked by a large man, K\u2019rell, and two felled trees on the dirt road.\n\nWind from the sea greets Paxson as he readies himself for the next man in front of him, a man with unkempt hair dressed in tribal leathers. He charges forward, swinging his short sword in an uppercut, closely following with a shield bash to stun his opponent. Unlike convention military training teaches, Paxson prefers to use his \u201cdefensive\u201d weapon aggressively. Paxson\u2019s buckler crashes into the tribesman\u2019s nose, sending blood flying in the air. More blood appears as his short sword finds his stunned opponent.\n\n\u201cLook!

We\u2019ll greet Tristrands men soon after.\u201d\n\nThe Reapers search the fallen bodies of the tribesmen and peer inside the wagons. Nothing too valuable is captured. Mostly dried meat and fruit.

There was a wealthy man once, who despite his riches led a double life. At night, he would dress in all black, cover his face with a mask, and break into different homes and museums. You see, it wasn\u2019t for the riches that he led a double life -- he had all that already. It was for the thrill. One night, as a wealthy member in society, he received an invitation to the governor\u2019s home. Masquerade party. The governor had a famed collection of rare jewels, ones passed down through generations of his family. Now our wealthy thief had a real challenge in front of him. The aforementioned jewels were the governor\u2019s most prized possession, in terms of monetary value and sentiment. Stealing them wouldn\u2019t be easy.

It doesn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cAh, just a different kind of invitation,\u201d Morgan answers. \u201cIn the story, the wealthy thief had to keep up appearances. He couldn\u2019t just disappear in the party the night the governor\u2019s jewels were taken. That\u2019d be too obvious. He was confined to mingle, to make his presence known as one of the other guests. You see, that reduces suspicion on him. That makes the governor think everything is happening according to plan. His invitation also came with certain limitations, but still, it brought the greatest chance at success.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, I get it. But it\u2019s still on the thief to execute the heist to perfection. Not only is stealing the governor\u2019s jewels a difficult task, he puts his entire identity at risk.

There are no exceptions for runaways. And I\u2019m afraid abandonment of one\u2019s house means your military responsibilities will be low.

You are hereby now part of the High Lord\u2019s army, young Master Scholhart.\u201d\n\nWith his final words, the councilor slams his hand down on a sheet of paper, stamping the bottom with his seal. No doubt he had that prepared ahead of time. How he knew beforehand, you know not. The sound of his stamp causes soldiers to rush in through the tent flaps. These ones are not like the ones encountered at first. Their towering bodies are in shiny silver plate, trimmed with gold. Each carries a sizable shield, although the accompanying weapon in their main hand varies. Some hold swords, others maces and battle axes. Only one holds a spear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll not give up so easily,\u201d Morgan says, drawing her sword.\n\n\u201cAlive, please.

You draw both sword and dagger, searching for weaknesses in their armor. The usual weak points have been addressed. As the elite guard move, you scan their underarms, neck, and knees, places that commonly have a break in defense. This armor, however, was forged with such places in mind. Small chain, connecting tiny plates, fills the gaps between sections in armor. You\u2019ll have to figure something else out.\n\nWhispers, incoherent words form at Morgan\u2019s mouth. Is she praying to the Lady? You\u2019ve never seen her begin battle this way. She finishes speaking and looks up. Her eyes, once a sparkling green, are pure black, two onyx beads. Light flickers for a moment, sending shadows bouncing from the tent walls. As the light returns to stationary, no longer flickering, something is off. It\u2019s more dim, like standing in the shade. Then, you see the result of Morgan\u2019s work.\n\nNext to Morgan are six images, six shadows, six perfect illusions of her. They attack.\n\nYou follow suit, weaving your weapons into an attack pattern with a series of thrusts. Any sort of slashing, arcing technique will have no effect on the heavily-armored guards. You need to find small openings in the armor with the point of your weapons. Your opponent, an elite member with a standard sword and shield, easily blocks your attacks. With a shield covering half his body, and plate armor behind said shield, finding any sort of opening will be difficult. Still, you search, poking, prodding with your weapons, looking for an area to exploit. Behind you, a shadow is consumed. A battle axe tears through the illusion, sending a flicker of light back into the room.\n\nYou continue your attack, throwing the heel of your boot into the guard\u2019s shield, pushing him off-balanced. You thrust forward, lunging onto one knee, changing levels. Your sword strikes true, piercing just above the waist, between the breastplate and greaves, angled up from your low lunge. More light flickers.\n\n\u201cUrgh,\u201d a voice, muted by the closed helm, murmurs, sounding more surprised than distressed. The back of the man\u2019s gauntlet slams into your face, sending you sprawling backward, hand released from your sword hilt. Your back meets Morgan\u2019s, the remaining illusion dispelled with a swing of a battle axe.\n\nMorgan turns, resting her hand on your cheek, lightly touching her forehead against yours. \u201cThe Lady will reunite us.

It\u2019s more jog than run, something that you weren\u2019t expecting. The squad seems to hold the same preference with mobility. Due to their numbers, victory can\u2019t be won through pure strength, so any advantage is taken. Reaching a defendable spot first is part of that.\n\nThey appear almost instantly, spanning across the horizon. Gods, there must be hundreds of them. Rolling hills are to the west, guarding much of the warm desert air from reaching the plains. Small figures rise just over the nearest hill\u2019s peak, marching toward the Helswith border. More and more appear, like ants spilling from within their hill.\n\n\u201cYou know the drill, Reapers! Form up!\u201d Pralthar\u2019s voice is direct, sure of himself. The trajectory of your jog takes you towards a series of stones scattered in the plains. The unit rearranges itself into an upside down V, like the point of a spear. Except for one man. One man, separate from the others, travels ten-twenty feet in front of the formation, exposed, alone. He seems to not mind the position, though. It must be a normal part of the formation, as untraditional as it might be.\n\nYou do as you\u2019re told, standing next to K\u2019rell, his hulking frame overshadowing your lean. Despite the large frame, the jogging doesn\u2019t appear to bother him, something that usually would affect one of his size. Near the series of stones, Pralthar calls for a cease in motion, and you halt position, still in the V formation.\n\n\u201cThink you\u2019ll leave some for the rest of us, Champion?\u201d K\u2019rell shouts towards the lone man, a haggard, resonating shout.\n\nThe man glances back, stoic, fitting for the current situation. \u201cI may let one or two filter through, unless you\u2019d like to join me up here.\u201d\n\nK\u2019rell laughs, a similar resonating sound as his shouting. Then, the barbarians attack.\n\nTheir strategy is uncoordinated. It\u2019s singular, each tribesman attacking on his own terms, abandoning the strength that they possess together. While the Great Warlord may have somehow united the tribes, he definitely hasn\u2019t united their battle tactics. At least not for these barbarians in particular. They crash into the formation, a scattered mess. The Reapers brace themselves for impact, raising their shields high, protecting themselves and the soldier next to them. Retaliation is a swift thrust of the spear. You notice the formation doesn\u2019t stay still. It slowly creeps forward, not allowing the numerous barbarians to surround. Each wave of undisciplined tribesmen results in more bodies to step over as the unit continuously moves forward.\n\nIn the center of the V, Squadleader Pralther looses another arrow from his greatbow. You notice most of his attention is focused on the lone man, the \u201cchampion.\u201d With expert aim, the barbarians who try to surround the man are picked off one by one. You realize the similarity between Pralthar\u2019s efforts and the V formation. It\u2019s about taking the fight directly ahead, keeping your strength compact, ready to press forward. It would fall apart if sheer numbers were allowed to encircle. The man on his own is a one-man squad, supported with Pralthar\u2019s aim.\n\nThe series of stones that the Reapers choose to fight in only aid their strategy. Without a direct path to overwhelm the small squad, the attacking barbarians are forced into reducing their number engaging. Next to K\u2019rell, it\u2019s clear his words were simple over exaggeration, confident words meant to put the men at ease. More than a few, most actually, make it past the champion, crashing into the V formation. You imitate the others, raising your shield, then moving on the offensive. It\u2019s not a difficult maneuver, but it\u2019s damn effective.\n\nAn axe clashes against your shield, sending a shock through your arm, the strength and sturdiness not built up for handling such blows. It only entices you for battle, waiting the appropriate amount of time, then thrusting your spear forward, finding a home for the point. The act brings an audible laugh from K\u2019rell next to you. He\u2019s obviously enjoying himself. Still, more tribesmen are there to replace the fallen, always one behind the other. More appear, starting to surround the lone man, the arrows from Pralthar not enough to drop them all. Soon, he\u2019ll be overwhelmed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Break rank and help", "result": "Despite K\u2019rell\u2019s warning ahead of time, you break rank and sprint towards the lone man\u2019s location, dodging axes and sword swings along the way.

Once finishing off the barbarians surrounding him, you\u2019ll return back to your position in the V formation.\n\nThe champion stands, spear in hand, buckler in the other, scanning the scene in front of him. He charges forward, thrusting the spearpoint into the nearest barbarian, causing a burst of red. Before removing the spear, the champion blocks two attacks with his buckler. One from the right, and the other from behind. Instead of pulling the spear, he draws a short sword from his hip, engaging the surrounding tribesmen.\n\nYou reach his position, abandoning your spear as well, throwing it into a nearby barbarian\u2019s chest, drawing your sword and dagger. The champion eyes you, surprised at the fact someone is next to him.\n\n\u201cThis is not your place, newcomer,\u201d he states.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m here all the same,\u201d you answer with a slight shrug. The enclosing barbarians attack. Wide sweeps with their axes deflect from your dagger, parrying the strikes off-target. Once an opening presents itself, which doesn\u2019t take long, your sword lands true in a series of slashes and cuts. You move swiftly, not standing in one location, always taking the fight towards the nearest tribesman. Something flies by your ear. An arrow. A body drops behind you, the result of Pralthar\u2019s aim.\n\nMore appear. Your constant movement is starting to wear on your strength. While your training is far more than the soldiers around you, your endurance is lacking. Such strength is only built during battle, the constant swinging of the sword, the constant blocking of blows. Your breath becomes heavy, breathing through an open mouth rather than nose, the first sign of fatigue.

Your breath is now struggling to keep up with the energy expenditure. Once each strike, each blow was paired with a sharp exhale. Now, you\u2019re finding it hard to keep a normal cadence. Suddenly thirsty, your tongue sticks to the top of your mouth, your body using up most of its stored resources. Stubborn, though, you continue attacking.\n\nThe champion does the same beside you, although he looks to be hardly breathing. This type of fighting is normal for him, endurance built up over countless skirmishes. The shield and sword in his hands are simply extensions of his limbs; they aren\u2019t added weight to carry.\n\nAn exhausting swing of your sword brings you off-balanced. The champion steps in front of you, blocking a blow that would have been your death.\n\n\u201cAre you mad? Get back with the others!\u201d he shouts.\n\nYour distraction causes an axe to land true in the champion\u2019s chest.

A warrior must adapt to the situation in front of him, and you do just that.\n\nInstead of charging the barbarian ahead of you, your feet remain still. You place a slight bend in your knees in order to absorb the impact of the impending blows. Your sudden shift in tactic causes a slight confused look from underneath the man\u2019s unshaved beard. He takes the offensive, rushing with powerful overhand blows.\n\nEach one is absorbed and redirected, but you can\u2019t stand in one place very long, not without a shield.

That was clearly shown through the friendliness of the banter. It doesn\u2019t feel right, but you remain in rank. The formation relies on it. The squadleader notices the surrounding barbarians and commands the unit forward.\n\nThe champion weaves his spear in an attempt to keep his opponents at bay, stopping them from closing in. He thrusts forward, then quickly angles to the right, narrowly avoiding an incoming axe swing. He turns, throwing his shoulder into a nearby barbarian, the one who almost took his head with the axe, pushing the man back a few steps. The champion\u2019s spear finds his off-balanced flesh.\n\nMore close in. The lone man whips around facing towards the squad, back turned towards the hills. His spear stabs forward, planting itself in another barbarian. Instead of pulling it out, he drives it deeper, pushing the man backward into several other tribesmen. The champion continues pushing, using the man impaled by his spear as a battering ram to reach back to the V formation. Along the way, he ducks down, sliding his buckler to a strap on his back, protecting himself like the shell of a turtle. Finally, he arrives back to the formation, a line cut through the barbarians, several cuts and glancing blows displayed on his body. Nothing too serious, though.\n\nThe barbarians\u2019 eyes on the lone man, they don\u2019t notice Pralthar\u2019s command. You do your best to follow the shift, although the instructions are nothing you\u2019ve heard before. The champion\u2019s mad scramble had brought the barbarians into a trap, putting himself as the bait. The snare snaps shut. On one angle of the V, the tribesmen don\u2019t see the other side closing in. The tip as a hinge, the far side of the V swings around, pincering the barbarians in from both sides. Steadily, methodically, you continue the attack, blocking first with your shield then stabbing forward with your spear. Soon, between a pile of dead tribesmen, you\u2019re face-to-face with the otherside of the pincer. The day is won.\n\nThe remaining barbarians, still outnumbering the squad, flee towards the hills. Strange. You assumed they would fight until none remained. That\u2019s the way of their god, if you remember your studies correctly. Perhaps they noticed not a single Helswith man had fallen. Perhaps they knew they were outmatched. Still, the behavior strikes you as strange. It doesn\u2019t seem to bother the others.\n\nYou follow the others back to the camp. The rest of the Reapers start to remove and clean their armor. Caius, the small-framed man handing out spears, creates a fire, running back and forth between the makeshift storeroom, a pile of boxes under tarp, and fire pit, gathering ingredients for the night\u2019s meal.\n\nK\u2019rell places a bedroll and canvas in your arms. \u201cAll the bunks are taken,\u201d he says, motioning towards the barracks, then towards the lone man sitting cross-legged under a nearby latus tree. \u201cAt least the champion has company now.\u201d\n\nCurious. Not only does the man fight alone, he sleeps alone, in the traditional sense of the word. You stride to the latus, noticing its jagged branches are empty of any flower, fruit, or leaves. On the surface it seems dead. Deep, though, are its roots. Your former mentor used to call them \u201cicebergs of the desert.\u201d Funny, that statement.\n\n\u201cYou have an interesting battle tactic,\u201d you speak, taking a seat under the latus tree. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it hasn\u2019t gotten you killed yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw them today.

You may meet the Eternal Father before me then. Unless the Great Warlord himself marches on this very position, you might find it hard to reach him. Even if he does, you\u2019ll find it just as hard -- moreso, with every available warrior of his battle-ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, the statement remains.\u201d\n\n\u201cBest of luck then.

It\u2019s a sound plan.\n\n---\n\nShe awoke to the sound of men\u2019s voices and footsteps dangerously near. Gods, she must have really spent her energy to not have been alerted sooner. Morgan sits up, listening for more movement. Dry grass at her feet, covered by in shadow from her night\u2019s refuge, Morgan patiently waits for the approaching soldiers. There\u2019s no use in running. Where would she go? She shouldn\u2019t have used so much of her power. It\u2019s her own fault.\n\nTwo men eventually find her. They\u2019re dressed in leather armor, painted with the High Lord\u2019s colors. Funny. All the soldiers she saw in the warcamp had their armor embroidered. These must be low level soldiers, or western frontsmen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I told her, there\u2019s no going back. Either you commit now, otherwise the ship\u2019s sailed\u2026 Hey who\u2019s this?\u201d One of the soldiers finishes his story, finding Morgan at the end. Both men are quickly approaching middle-age, a slowed metabolism showing by the way their leather armor juts out, not unlike the rolling hills of the plains.\n\n\u201cA woman lost on the plains? She doesn\u2019t look like a savage,\u201d the other man peers at Morgan, his brow furrowing in thought. \u201cHey wasn\u2019t there a woman who escaped from the warcamp?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was,\u201d Morgan answers. \u201cAnd you better forget you ever saw her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure I like being talked to that way,\u201d the first soldier speaks to his fellow.\n\n\u201cYou should be used to it by now,\u201d the other replies. Back towards Morgan, he adds, \u201cSorry, lady. Orders are orders. \u2018The capture of this woman will net the honorable man fifteen marks and a granted leave of absence of one month.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYour \u2018orders\u2019 sound more like a bounty. Surely, honorable men such as yourselves are above such distasteful actions.\u201d\n\nThey look at one another. One shrugs to the other. \u201cSorry, miss\u2026\u201d\n\nMorgan sighs. As they draw closer, she holds up her hands, palms facing them as if in surrender. Then, when they\u2019re in range, Morgan\u2019s open palms curl into fists. One finds a jaw, and the other finds a temple. Both men collapse to the ground, like saddlebags slipping from a sprinting horse.\n\n\u201cHmm. I suppose that\u2019s as much a challenge as I expected,\u201d Morgan comments.\n\nRest, recover, then sneak back into camp. The first two are taken care of. As Morgan walks out from underneath the stone, she surveys the scene before her. The High Lord\u2019s army, in full force, is marching directly toward her. Countless soldiers, like stones on the rocky beaches of the Helswith, heading her way. Infantry march in small clusters, backed by archers behind them. The famed chariots of High Lord Ursa are behind, ready to gallop at a moment\u2019s notice. Slower moving siege machines, ballistae and light trebuchet follow behind the calvary, although their arrival at a destination would be far delayed.\n\n\u201cAnd here I thought it would be simple. Gods, nothing is ever easy,\u201d Morgan mutters under her breath, examining the two unconscious soldiers at her feet, searching for supplies. Satisfied by a few rations, she takes off, west, away from the approaching army and travels deeper into the barbarian plains. Things never go as planned.", "action_results": [{"action": "High Lord Ursa", "result": "It was time. Damn savages have threatened his borders long enough. For years, he put up with their constant buzzing, minor annoyances to bring him glory. Now, though, somehow they\u2019ve banded, uniting the western tribes under a single banner. Like the stories of old, a \u201cGreat Warlord\u201d is leading their people. Damn savages. He\u2019ll run each one down with his chariots.\n\nUrsa, the High Lord, leans over a table, hands bearing most of his weight against the structure. Atop, a map of the plains sits, cutting off a few miles into the Helswith to the east. Ursa runs a hand through his dark hair. Despite his namesake, his face is clean-shaven, proper, as a High Lord\u2019s should be. His wavy hair reaches his shoulders, braided with a few ceremonial beads at the back, a few loose strands falling in front of his face. It seems no matter how tightly woven the beads are, the same strands fall loose. He\u2019s grown rather fond of them. So has his latest concubine. She\u2019s asleep now, though, giving him time to study the upcoming battle plans. The sweet thing breathes softly behind him, auburn hair spread around her like leaves on a willow tree, bed covers barely exposing the top of her nipple.\n\nOutnumbered 20-1, the High Lord thinks to himself. But still they haven\u2019t marched in force yet. Why haven\u2019t they marched in force?\n\nHis eyes glued to the map, the High Lord imagines through the possibilities of the upcoming battle\u2019s outcome.\n\n\u201cThe plains aren\u2019t as plain-like as one would think. They\u2019re rocky. Rarely does one discover a hill unmarked by stones. The flatlands themselves are another challenge. High grass, hiding rock beneath their strands, fills the plains, causing disruption where one would move quickly through.\u201d\n\nThe words of Ursa\u2019s advisors ring in his head as his gaze remains fixed on the map. The environment may be less than ideal for his famed chariots, but he\u2019s confident in his might. Not a single frontier squad had allowed a barbarian raid to reach the main camp. Heavy losses were incurred with the slaves and non-soldiers he recruited, but still, with their numbers, the tribesmen should have at least punched through a single squad. Perhaps they\u2019re as ill-trained as his reports say. Overconfidence was the mark of his father, the previous High Lord Ursang. Ursa would be different. He had to be different.\n\nHands appear at his lower stomach, slipping inside of the sheer silk robe around Ursa\u2019s shoulders. A sly woman, this one. Cold hands feel his tanned skin, its dark texture made warm by the finest wine in Helswith. A woman\u2019s cheek plants against his upper back, pressing herself closer into the Helswith leader.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so serious when you look at that thing.\u201d Her voice is soft, high-pitched. Just as you\u2019d expect from someone who possesses such beauty.\n\n\u201cI bear the burden of my father and my father\u2019s father,\u201d Ursa answers, placing his hands on the backs of the woman\u2019s. Gods, they\u2019re soft. Tender.\n\n\u201cYou will cut down the savages?\u201d the woman asks, knowing full-well the answer. She had, after all, been in Ursa\u2019s bed when the idea came to his mind.\n\nUrsa nods, sending the loose strands in front of his face dancing. \u201cYes. They\u2019ve grown too bold. Allowing them to live, to band together like this was a mistake of my father\u2019s. One that I will soon correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know why they have allied themselves now? Did you do something against them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, my dear. One cannot understand the ways of the savages. They sacrifice their fellows to their god. As far as our former diplomats reported, they have no written word. They are mere beasts, superstitious in nature, allowed to roam at our approval. It\u2019s gone on far too long, and they will soon learn why threatening Helswith is not in their best interest.\u201d\n\nThe High Lord sips at the goblet resting on the table top and continues. \u201cTheir \u2018Great Warlord\u2019 is simply a man clinging to the past, using an ancient title to further his own pursuit. He will soon learn the danger in threatening a true leader, a nation strengthened with military might. This will be my greatest glory, my dear. I hope you count yourself lucky to share it with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShare? I take what I want,\u201d the woman answers, sending her hands lower. The High Lord doesn\u2019t stop her.", "action_results": [{"action": "Morgan II", "result": "Those two soldiers, who surprisingly managed to sneak up on Morgan -- due to her exhaustion -- weren\u2019t the only ones she ran into. More accurately, ran through. The plains offer little shelter for someone trying to go unnoticed. The plain\u2019s tall grass and rocky hills help, sure, but those are more temporary solutions. They work well for sneaking around a few soldiers, but there\u2019s a whole goddamn army at her back.\n\nTonight, however, she\u2019s seeking them. Her target is an officer, one that will possess knowledge of a certain prisoner in their camp or at the very least be able to share what happens to prisoners once the army mobilizes.\n\nIt\u2019s dark. Small fires burn safely within the camp\u2019s interior, protected by both patrolling and stationary guards. Tiny movement appears near the flame. It may be late, but not everyone is asleep within the camp. Something to take into account. Tall grass as her cover, Morgan glides forward, silent, like a lion stalking prey.\n\nThe first line of defense doesn\u2019t notice her. Neither does the second.\n\nMorgan finds herself in rows of tents, lined up like buildings in a city. She pauses a moment in an \u201calley,\u201d taking refuge in its shadow. Heavy boots draw near, then fade past. A group of men finally retiring to their makeshift barracks, if Morgan had to guest. They don\u2019t notice the woman crouched between canvas structures.\n\nThere. Her prey must be inside. A tent, largest from what Morgan\u2019s seen, lies ahead. Several spearmen are posted outside as sentries. Where exactly does one hide their secrets? Behind lock and key, in this case, armored soldiers. Morgan waits, listening for movement, then darts across the street towards the next row of tents, hiding between each. She repeats the action three more times before arriving at her destination.\n\nThe tent is of red canvas. Soft light shines from within, illuminating small gaps between the canvas and dirt in a line of light. Four soldiers at the door, another four patrolling the perimeter. Her prey must really be paranoid. For good reason. After assessing the patrol\u2019s movement, their cadence, their pattern, Morgan breaks for the tent, aiming for the light peering through the canvas floor. She slides, well more of a roll so as to not disrupt the dirt, scooping the bottom of the tent up, pulling it just high enough for her body to slip under. As quickly as it\u2019s raised, it drops back to its original position. One of the patrolling guards strolls past, oblivious to the quick motion that just took place.\n\nThe interior looks familiar. Red silk pillows, arranged in a circle, lie in the center of the tent, its backdrop a desk in the foreground of several bookcases. It\u2019s a little different, but there\u2019s no mistaking the councilor\u2019s furniture. Strange. The soldiers outside were normal, not the armored elites that separated Morgan from her partner. Still, Morgan keeps an air of caution. She definitely did not want to run into them again, especially alone. She\u2019s about to discover how formidable the councilor is without his elite guard. Not very, is Morgan\u2019s guess.\n\nHis back is turned, hands searching for a particular book on the shelves. Gods, it must be difficult to travel with so many leather-bounds. A little easier, though, when you have free labor chained at the wrists. He doesn\u2019t notice her presence until Morgan\u2019s hand clamps around his mouth, dagger pressing into his lower back.\n\nMorgan brings her lips close to the councilor\u2019s ear, allowing him to feel her breath as she whispers. \u201cHello again, your eminence. Our last conversation was so rudely interrupted. I assure you, that won\u2019t be the case this time around.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou...you\u2026\u201d the councilor tries to speak, words failing him at Morgan\u2019s sudden appearance.\n\n\u201cYes, me,\u201d Morgan answers with a little laugh, one that would get a man\u2019s blood hot in an aleroom setting. \u201cYou know who I seek. Where is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe released him,\u201d the councilor manages to say.\n\n\u201cYou what? For what purpose?\u201d\n\nThe councilor answers, gaining back his resolve. \u201cTracking purposes. The High Lord is marching straight for the horde\u2019s leader, and we, uh, don\u2019t exactly know his location. The prisoner was obviously aligned with the \u2018Great Warlord,\u2019 and he\u2019ll take us straight to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cFools. Why not simply interrogate him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did. Not even our thickest needles could bring a response. So I had an unfortunate \u2018servant\u2019 bring the prisoner\u2019s meal, giving him instructions that would...present a certain opportunity for the prisoner. He\u2019ll lead us right to the horde\u2019s position where High Lord Ursa will cut them down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where exactly is his last known location?\u201d\n\nThe councilor replies by pointing to a scroll on one of his shelves. Morgan guides them both over, where the councilor grabs and unrolls the parchment, allowing them both to read its contents. It\u2019s a simple map of the plains, marked with coordinates, dates, and times. Whoever is tracking Joren is sending back current updates of their location as the most recent date is yesterday\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis will do,\u201d Morgan comments, shoving her dagger into the councilor\u2019s back. His cry, mixed with a gurgle, is muted by her palm against his mouth. Morgan carefully guides the councilor, again, this time to the floor as not to alert the sentries. The floor at his bookshelves start to match the red silk pillows in the center of the tent.\n\nMorgan folds the parchment into a small square and places it inside of her pocket. She had some ground to cover. First Joren, then her Nameless partner. Lady give her strength.", "action_results": [{"action": "Into the barbarian plains", "result": "The man\u2019s face is a mixture of surprise and bewilderment at your sudden arrival. The battlefield is a chaotic place, one-on-one duels have no place here. Whatever \u201chonor\u201d comes from testing yourself against another is lost, a false romantic notion brought by poets and scholars. True war is unfair. Rules don\u2019t apply, save for one. Survive.\n\nYour blade finds his exposed back, his axe swing already blocked by Paxson\u2019s buckler. Paxson, no stranger to unfair circumstances, learned that lesson quickly in the arena, a lesson that he brought with him to the western plains. Gladiatorial matches are often stacked on one side, especially with lesser known names. It\u2019s all about the enjoyment of the people, rather than an even fight. It was just one of Paxson\u2019s many challenges along the way to reuniting with her.\n\nYour current battlefield is a dirt road, not wide enough for two wagons side-by-side, along the northern coast of the plains. The Reapers were sent deeper west and then north to the coastline with orders to stop supply lines from reaching the horde. With resource shortages, the tribes are bound to turn on one another.\n\nYour mission would be a lot easier with naval support from King Tristrand, a simple blockage would result in the same outcome of all your hard-fought efforts, but the islands to the east lie silent. It\u2019s a mystery to Helswith, as Tristrand relies on importing goods to survive. You\u2019re sure there will be a sizable tax added to Helswith goods after the war ends for their unresponsiveness and seemingly unwillingness to aid.\n\nFour wagons, single file, are hit hard by the Reapers. Battles were won outnumbered by the tribesmen. These supply raids could hardly be considered as such. Often they were poorly defended, their position made worse by the terrain. It only adds to the Reapers\u2019 chance at success.\n\nPaxson blocks a spear, redirecting the weapon away from his body. He steps forward, coming into sword range -- a place where spearmen lie exposed -- and finishes the man with one swing of his short sword. Three more stand in front of him, one after another due to the narrow road. On the open plains, they\u2019d surround him. Here, they aren\u2019t afforded that luxury.\n\nGlancing to Paxson, you duck underneath the wagon, rolling to the opposite side. There, you\u2019re met with an axehead, barely missing your ducking head. Still in motion, you kick a foot out, tripping your opponent, a man with unkempt hair and beard like a mane, swinging your sword up, catching his throat on the way down. Hurdling the body, you make for the back of the wagon, meaning to flank the three barbarians closing in on Paxson. You arrive to find Paxson planting his sword in a fallen opponent, the last of the three.\n\nHe shrugs. \u201cSometimes the direct approach is best.\u201d\n\nYou eye the small wounds accumulated on his forearms. His left leg is dyed red from an unseen cut, the blood staining his trouser leg from within, not from his handiwork. Then, you look down at your own body. Not a single mark is on your body. \u201cSure, if you want to single-handedly keep the surgeon in business.\u201d\n\nPaxson laughs. \u201cMinor scrapes, nothing more. You fight well for one raised in silk sheets, despite your aversion for dirtying yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no problem with that,\u201d you answer. \u201cThese barbarians simply offer me no threat. The gap between our skill level is too wide, although by your \u2018scrapes,\u2019 I can tell the gap is lesser.\u201d\n\nSquadleader Pralthar approaches, bow in hand. His left side of his face is bathed in grime and sweat. Obviously, he had engagement well-within melee range. \u201cReport casualties.\u201d\n\nYou glance around, seeing Caius and K\u2019rell alive and well, the other two from your initial strike force on the wagons. Pralthar and the rest of the Reapers followed up in the chaos you ensued.\n\n\u201cNone, sir,\u201d you answer, jumping on top of the nearest wagon. You rip back the canvas covering its contents. \u201cThis one\u2019s holding dried meat. Looks like some fruit as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cDried too, I hope?\u201d Pralthar asks.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d you reply. \u201cMuch easier to deal with than fresh.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the reins. We\u2019ll escort these back to the cave,\u201d the squadleader commands. After searching the tribesmen\u2019s bodies and not finding much, you pack up the captured supplies and travel back to the cave, your temporary base of operations.\n\nThe \u201ccave\u201d is more of an inlet, a place on the cliffside where sea level digs into the bluffs. A winding road leads down to the beach, where the overhang of rock sits a few hundred paces. From the plains, it\u2019s hidden. From the sea is a different story, but the barbarians aren\u2019t ones to travel by boat. Their sea activity is kept solely to supplies.\n\nFor the time being, you\u2019re content to stay in the Reapers and the authority of Pralthar. You haven\u2019t forgotten your mission. It\u2019s burned in your memory, and the tattoo on your arm is a constant reminder. As the Lady\u2019s herald, your goal of confronting the Great Warlord has remained unchanged. The task will be easier once you weaken his forces, and with Pralthar in charge, you\u2019re doing exactly that. Only a fool would charge directly in, placing their strength directly against the Warlord\u2019s. Funny, that\u2019s likely what Paxson would do in your position. You\u2019ve learned patience. A hunter requires the trait to strike at the proper moment. With the Reapers, you chip away at the Warlord\u2019s defenses, seeking to land the killing blow once he\u2019s vulnerable.\n\nBy the time you finish unloading, the sun is nearly set. The cave\u2019s floor is sand, so the Reapers have taken to creating makeshift wooden floorboards, built with planks and various pieces of lumber picked up in raids. Each man, even Paxson, has their own island, a floorboard of wood with a personal tent built on top. Most, however, don\u2019t take advantage of the canvas privacy, seeking companionship over solitude. The air is warm enough that a fire isn\u2019t needed, and the dried food on the latest recovery takes out the other use for a fire.\n\n\u201cGet some rest, men. Tomorrow we\u2019ll continue along the coast. It\u2019s best not to stay in one place too long,\u201d Pralthar speaks from his island.\n\nYou gladly follow the command, feeling the strain of battle now that adrenaline\u2019s worn off. Slowly, you feel your endurance being built up, a result of prolonged battle. While you have been well-trained, the grind, the grueling consistency of battle wore heavy on your body. Now, you feel in a place where your body is conditioned for it, like there\u2019s no longer a liability in that regard.\n\nYour eyes begin to soften, drawing heavy, then closing completely. Bright light! The suddenness causes you to sit up suddenly. Around you, everyone\u2019s asleep. Already? It\u2019s only been a few seconds. It\u2019s completely dark, no sign of the sun is present. Perhaps, it was longer than a few seconds after all.\n\nThe sudden light subsided, you glance around sensing for the Lady. Where is she? The woman flocked by crows. You long to view her timeless face, one that\u2019s unmarked by flaws, her golden hair floating just above her bare shoulders. She\u2019s been absent of late. Somehow that brings a feeling of loneliness, like the empty side of a widow\u2019s bed. She said she would appear when you need her. She should be present all the time then.\n\nYour arm burns for a moment as if a stray ember fell on top of it. You look down. The tattoo on your inner arm, a crow mid-flight, glows softly on one side. The left wing. As you draw your arm closer for a better look, the light subtly moves to another section of the bird, although the glow itself remains stationary. It\u2019s pointing in a specific direction, like guiding stars for sea voyage. It\u2019s dark. No one else is awake.", "action_results": [{"action": "Follow the light", "result": "Your last interaction with the Lady left an impression in your mind. Besides drawing you closer to her, deeping your bond, it was the first time you learned of her. She fights an unseen battle. She\u2019s charged with stopping the return of Uralan.

Your trust is fully in the Lady, and you\u2019ll follow her signs.\n\nYou rise without a sound, meaning to follow the glow without waking the others. Despite the repertoire that you\u2019ve steadily built up over skirmishes, it doesn\u2019t look good if you sneak away from camp. You\u2019re still, after all, an \u201cadd-on,\u201d a soldier that is conscripted into service rather than joining of his own accord. That fact alone will always stain your reputation with a linger of doubt, especially this early on.\n\nSand is easy enough to move silently through. Its sound is non-existent with your light footsteps, and there aren\u2019t obstacles on the ground to give away your position, such as dry leaves or small twigs. It\u2019s sand, rocks, and some shells, which you take great care to avoid. The light takes you further down the beach, away from the winding path to reach the cave.\n\nYour vision is dyed with blue light from the moon, shining visibly, sparkling a deep navy, on the ocean water before you. Minutes later, you look down at your arm for direction. It\u2019s dark, the glow no longer appearing. What is the Lady trying to show you? There, on the water. Ships. Shadowy, masts rising like scarred trees. They float at the coastline, sails folded up in an anchored position.\n\nAnchored position\u2026 The cave! You turn around, ready to warn the others of the sudden ships and come face-to-face with Paxson. He stands, hands on his hips, eyeing you.\n\n\u201cTristrand,\u201d he spits. Seeing your surprise, he continues. \u201cHeard you getting up. Thought you might be up to something. One does not sleep easily in a gladiator school.\u201d\n\n\u201cTristrand. What\u2019s he doing here?\u201d you ponder aloud. \u201cWe need to get back--\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when you notice the countless rowboats on the shore. Dark figures stand on the beach, standing above the Reapers, like an executioner over a kneeling man. Desperately, you rush forward, intending to sprint back to the cave. Paxson stops you with an arm.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d he asks, not as a question. \u201cDid you know they were coming. Is that why you fled at the exact moment of their arrival?\u201d\n\nHe peers at you like a father searching for dishonesty in his son\u2019s eye. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t know. We need to get back. We need to help them.\u201d\n\nYou attempt to push past him, but he holds you in front. \u201cBullshit. It\u2019s too late anyway. You had something to do with this. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\n\nAngered by his accusation, you shove Paxson with both hands, sending him stumbling a few steps back. \u201cDamn you. I had nothing to do with this. We need to get back. We need to help them.\u201d\n\nAn anger, similar to yours, folds his face into a scowl, although he does not strike back. He does keep you from advancing though, stretching both arms out like a net capturing fish in the sea. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s no use. There are too many of them. How is it that you left at the exact moment they showed up?\u201d\n\nThe repetition of his question and the implication associated with it causes you to fire a right fist into Paxson\u2019s face. He stumbles, clutching where your blow landed, but then returns to his standing position, arms stretched out, stoicism filling his face rather than the anger displayed a moment ago. His demeanor only ignites you. You throw another right hand, then a left, finishing by grabbing the back of Paxson\u2019s head and sending your knee into his nose. He stumbles, again, then returns to his position, blood pouring from a broken nose.\n\n\u201cWill that be all, Master Scholhart?\u201d he speaks.\n\nMaster Scholhart. Your father, his owner. The bond shared by battle is not enough to erase the scars left by servitude. The very thing you\u2019ve spent your life avoiding has become your reality. A curse haunting your blood. The sins of a father passed down to his firstborn. Master Scholhart, a title you replaced with Nameless, still rears its ugly head. Broken, pieced together by an attempt at redemption, you collapse to your knees. Paxson still stands.\n\nPure disgust fills your mouth, like biting into a piece of spoiled meat. After a few heaves, your body hurls bits of dry meat and fruit from your mouth. As you wipe the corner of your mouth, movement appears in front of you. A hand outstretched, a symbol of aid, friendship. You look up to see Paxson offering a hand to help you to your feet. Humbled, you allow this man, a slave owned by your father, a man forced into combat same as you, a man marked by similar tragedy, to pull you up.\n\nThe newly arrived sailors slaughter your friends on the beach.

You thought maybe taking the lead would highlight your confrontation from last night, although Paxson seems to be past that. What\u2019s done is done, and you have a joint vengeance to seek.\n\nFor days, they travel due south, heading straight for the heartland of the plains. Soon, the view of the ocean is replaced with nothing but grass, the bluffs a place you grew to enjoy, is left far behind you. Tracking them soon becomes difficult, not because they\u2019re nimble, but due to the openness of the plains. As you traverse the rolling hills, you\u2019re forced to wait until the soldiers reach the next peak before moving forward. Each time they pass from view, you grow a little nervous to lose them. You\u2019re reminded, though, that a number such as theirs doesn\u2019t simply disappear. Even if you got to the next peak and discovered they\u2019d vanished, there would be clues leading in their direction. The thought is a bit comfortable, although it doesn\u2019t entirely bring you to ease.\n\nCresting the next hill causes you to duck for cover. Sheltered by a boulder, you peer down the hillside. Like the way a forest hides the ground with its trees, the horde\u2019s army is sitting at the bottom of the hill, a basin, flatlands large enough to hold the entire mob. Tristrand\u2019s soldiers have brought you to the very doorsteps of the Great Warlord. The camp is built in a circular shape, all surrounding a tent that must be the size of a small building.\n\n\u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d Paxson whispers next to you.\n\n\u201cThe Great Warlord,\u201d you answer.\n\nYou notice the soldiers, Tristrand\u2019s men, greet some of the sentries, then begin to set up camp just outside the horde\u2019s. Seems despite their apparent partnership, they aren\u2019t allowed fully into the warcamp. As you continue to watch, you realize your initial thought was a little off. While Tristrand\u2019s men are on the outskirts of camp, several of them enter the horde, probably looking for a way to blow off steam. You\u2019re sure the horde has plenty of strong drinks and willing women. Distractions, meant to stave off the burden of a soldier\u2019s responsibility for a moment. Works well for the common soldier, at little expense to their leaders.\n\n\u201cUh oh. I\u2019m not sure I like that look,\u201d Paxson comments, noticing your brow furled in thought.\n\nDespite his light-hearted comment, you don\u2019t reflect the same. \u201cI told you once I would kill their leader. Tonight may be the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for taking the fight to them, but there are tens of thousands,\u201d Paxson replies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even come across any Helswith soldiers along the way here. We\u2019re deep in enemy territory without support.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have enough support,\u201d you answer, thinking of the Lady. She promised. She would aid you when you need her. This is the moment. You would need her to accomplish this task.\n\nPaxson, thinking you meant him, says, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can, but this is a one-way mission. I don\u2019t possess your crafitness. I\u2019m but a dull hammer meant to bash my enemies into submission.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Sometimes the direct approach is the best way,\u2019\u201d you quote Paxson.\n\n\u201cGods. Sometimes it\u2019s not.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "The direct approach", "result": "While the \u201cdirect approach\u201d for Paxson may be lowering his shoulder and running through a door, your version of the statement is more subtle. An idea forms in your mind, but you remain in your position, watching the horde for a while longer. The soldiers in blue, Tristrand\u2019s naval members, are able to walk freely within the camp. You see three of them make their way past several plainsmen who guard the perimeter. Gods. From here, they look out of their element, like a fish out of water.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to make it two steps within the horde of barbarians, you\u2019re going to need a disguise. Two royal blue uniforms should do the trick. Now, there\u2019s just a matter of waiting for some of the naval members to isolate themselves enough to catch them unawares. You wait, patiently. Beside the three who initially entered the camp, the rest stick together, never straying too far from their position. That\u2019s certainly going to make things more difficult. The day steadily transitions to evening, the sun lowering from its position directly above you. Huh. Sometimes all it takes is a change is perspective. Focusing too hard on one outcome can blind you from another, a simpler resolution.\n\nSingle lane dirt paths wind through the horde\u2019s location, leading in different directions, ensuring the Great Warlord\u2019s location is the center hub of the plains. King Tristrand\u2019s soldiers, who\u2019ve never visited the plains before, took a straight path to arrive, hiking over hills, most likely working from a compass direction rather than actual map. After spending some time in the plains, you\u2019re not even sure a map would help. The roads themselves are hardly straightforward, each twisting and winding around stone and overgrown grass, crossing over one another like snakes in a bucket. You explain your idea to Paxson, who agrees, and follows you from your vantage point back to the nearest road.\n\n---\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take too long, not even an entire hour, before dust appears on the horizon. Someone\u2019s coming your way. With this many warriors brought together, ones that are used to roaming freely on the plains, it\u2019s no wonder tribesmen come and go almost constantly. They don\u2019t travel in rows; they\u2019re scattered on the road like patrons in a crowded alehouse.\n\n\u201cScouts?\u201d you whisper to Paxson. He\u2019s crouched next to you. You\u2019ve found a sizable boulder to hide behind, the overgrown grass surrounding you as a sanctuary. Between strands of grass, you can barely see through. Better a limited view than an exposed position.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he whispers back. \u201cLook.\u201d Now that they\u2019re closer, you notice two of them carry a twine of rabbit slung over their shoulders. Not a scouting party. Hunters.\n\nYou wait until they reach you, just barely passing by as to hit their flank. Again, your version of the \u201cdirect approach\u201d bends the meaning of \u201cdirect.\u201d Up close now, you count seven of them, each wearing light hide armor. Their armor wouldn\u2019t do much good against a spearpoint, but it\u2019d do the trick against a stray slash of the axe.\n\nRealization falls over you. The tribesmen, at least these ones, aren\u2019t equipped for a full-on clash with Helswith. Is that why they haven\u2019t marched on the desert? They\u2019re equipment is suited towards minor disputes, in-fighting, between tribes. Redirecting their combined focus on Helswith doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are severely out engineered, despite their overwhelming numbers.\n\nUsing your training, you move swiftly and quietly behind the hunters, sticking low underneath their eye line. Your weight is dispersed through the balls of your feet, limiting the total amount of foot surface that touches the road; the less of your foot that physically touches the ground, the less likely an unwanted noise will appear. Muscles in your legs flex, absorbing the impact of your steps.\n\nYour breath is intentionally slowed, and you creep forward at a steady pace, not allowing sudden movements to alert the hunters of your presence. Your dagger is already drawn. Too many would-be assassins make the mistake of drawing their weapon too close to their target, like people don\u2019t notice the sound of a blade being pulled from its sheath. Your first victim is but ten feet away...six...three\u2026\n\nPaxon\u2019s feet scuffle the ground. Seven pairs of eyes quickly turn around, eight when you look back to flash him a look of disapproval.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t acknowledge your stare, rushing past you before you even turn back around towards the hunters. When you do, you see Paxson in the air, propelled higher by his charge. He lands on the first hunter, like a lion pouncing on its prey. Simultaneously, his short sword slashes the hunters neck, who, fallen prone, is unable to muster any sort of defense. Six remaining.\n\nAfter getting past the initial surprise of the attack, the hunters gather, throwing down their catch to avenge their fellow man. All are focused on Paxson as he willingly threw himself into the group of hunters. Something wizzes past your ear, like an angry hornet after its nest is disturbed. All, minus one, are focused on Paxson, a tribesman nocking another arrow seems to have taken interest in you.\n\nYou throw your dagger at the archer, and unlike his attempt, your projectile lands, collapsing the man to his knees, briefly clutching the wound at his neck before falling face-first into the dirt. Then, you join Paxson\u2019s engagement with the other five, flanking them from the side. The closest doesn\u2019t react to your presence until it\u2019s too late. Four. Paxson blocks an axe, sending the crown of his head into the man\u2019s nose, stunning him, then stabbing him through the stomach. Three.\n\nAn axe swings at your torso, which you easily dodge by stepping out of range, gliding back in before the tribesman can recover. Your blade slashes through his chest in the exact place you avoided being fatally cut. Two. Paxson blocks a blow with his buckler, simultaneously stabbing in the opposite direction, burying the point of his short sword into a hunter trying to catch him unawares. One. Paxson bashes his shield forward, dazing the remaining man, then kicks his legs out from under him. His short short quickly follows up. Zero.\n\nAfter, you and Paxson drag the bodies into the surrounding grass, doing your best to hide pooling blood from the dirt path. The result isn\u2019t perfect, but the red sections of the dirt would easily be overlooked unless someone\u2019s staring directly at them. Dressed now in the hunter\u2019s garb, their catch of rabbit slung over your shoulders, you\u2019re ready to infiltrate the horde. You\u2019re ready to kill the Great Warlord. Uralan\u2019s return must be stopped.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Great Warlord", "result": "The next day, as you draw closer to the horde, you slowly begin to see that their camp is more like a small city, rather than a traditional war camp. The contrast between the Great Warlord\u2019s and High Lord Ursa\u2019s is easily seen. The horde has women and children running through the \u201cstreets,\u201d marching with the warriors, making sure the men are fed and tended to. The more you think about it, the more it makes sense. The western tribes are used to fighting one another. Now, allied, they still don\u2019t seem to trust one another, as they\u2019re obviously unwilling to leave their families undefended. Or perhaps they\u2019re worried about a Helswithian attack. Probably the former.\n\nJust like you\u2019d expect, nothing matches. The horde is like a quilt, pieced together with varying pieces not meant to be sewn together. The result, while functional in its designed purpose, quite frankly isn\u2019t a pretty sight. Unlike the Helswithian matching silver and gold, the horde wears simple padded leather, allowing their hair and beards to grow long. There are no symbols displaying rank, no insignias, differing weapons and armor, just, a horde. Likewise, with such a high number of warriors, you\u2019re able to slip into the camp unnoticed dressed as one of them.\n\nThe ground beneath you has been stamped to dirt. There may have been long grass here, in the basin, at one point, but not now. Not with hundreds of thousands of feet stomping on it daily. Dirt beneath your feet, surrounded mostly by warriors in leather armor, the horde\u2019s camp is very...brown, and that\u2019s not to mention the waste excreted by the large number either.\n\nAs far as you can tell, there\u2019s no design to the horde\u2019s layout. It seems like a mob of tents piled near one another. It\u2019s easy to see where one tribe ends and another begins, though. Small walls built from stone, barely waist high, separate each tribe. The wall wouldn\u2019t deter anyone from entering, but it definitely would point out who belongs or not. From what you\u2019ve heard, crime -- at least thievery -- is almost non-existent with the horde. Removing limbs for petty theft will have that effect.\n\nOnly a few minutes into infiltrating the horde, and you realize the tribesmen are gathering in one direction, like a school of fish heading downstream. The quickest way to show you don\u2019t belong is to continue in your direction, so you turn to follow the assembly. You end up in a large open area, unobstructed by equipment. The horde spans out before you, countless tribesmen lined up in no apparent order. If this were Helswith, they would be neatly placed in rank. Far off in the distance, across several thousand heads, is a wooden platform. A stage. On it, stands a man, hands clasped behind him, watching the horde assemble. His posture is forthright, displaying confidence at the number before him.

An attempt in front of his entire army isn\u2019t the place.

His voice projects over a great distance, magically enhanced so that the horde could hear him speak. His vocal tone surprises you, though. It\u2019s not ragged. It\u2019s not rough. Rather, it\u2019s smooth, his words flowing like a proper instructor or politician, both of which are skills required for his position.\n\n\u201c...the people of Helswith have lived high and mighty for too long. Comfort has crept into their veins, poisoning the host. They rest on fine silk and speak poorly of the laborman, the very men who make their society possible. No, they must not be allowed to continue, not while spitting in our direction.\u201d\n\nA voice from the horde answers the Warlord, softer in volume. The Warlord seems to be the only one with magic aiding his speech. \u201cThen why have we been sitting here? We should have marched months ago!\u201d\n\nThe Great Warlord answers with far more understanding than you expected. \u201cIt was not the right moment to strike. The spirit being was building his strength within me. Striking without his aid would be folly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now is?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. The signs are before us! The spirit being speaks to me in my dreams. His power is made manifest through me, and subsequently, you. And who should share in our glory? My long lost high priest has returned, a holy man who is instrumental in our cause.\u201d\n\nA man steps next to the Great Warlord. Even at this distance, details barely visible, there\u2019s not mistaking his identity. Joren. The Warlord motions, again, to Joren. \u201cStep forward, priest. Your return is a sign from the spirit being. Victory will be ours. At long last, we march on Helswith and the privileged Ursa. Your travels have taken you through the desert, priest. Do you have any insight to share with us?\u201d\n\nAs Joren prepares to speak, suddenly a man rushes onto the stage behind the Warlord. He whispers something in the Warlord\u2019s ear, the urgency of the moment causing him to rest a hand on the Warlord\u2019s shoulder, something that you\u2019re sure would be punished with a quick severing in any other circumstance.\n\nThe Great Warlord turns back to the horde. \u201cSeems we won\u2019t have to march far. Ursa and his pretend soldiers are on their way here. Prepare yourselves, burn an offering to the spirit being. War is upon us! Their chariots mean nothing in the rocky plains. The foolish \u2018High Lord\u2019 is giving away his advantage -- a direct cause of our patience and obedience to the spirit being. Gather yourselves, men. Tomorrow, we feast on Helswith blood and bone.\u201d\n\nIf the horde wasn\u2019t a frenzied, chaotic mess, it certainly is now. Each tribe scrambles to reunite with their own, getting in the way of others. Small fights, nothing major, break out, causing a few drops of blood, but nothing too serious. You see only one path to take. Shadow the Warlord. Joren at his side, Uralan\u2019s return tied with him, all of your enemies have grouped together nicely for you. How very kind of them.

Thousands upon thousands of tribesmen lie between you and him. The task, the duty the Lady herself gave you spurs you into action. Everything is so close to completion. Motioning to Paxson, who quickly understands your meaning, you attempt to push your way past the rushing tribesmen to get closer to Joren and the Warlord.\n\nFrom the stage area, your prey is surrounded by a wall of soldiers, elites by the look of them -- every prominent leader has their own. Within the safety of their white and black shields, your targets move east along the war camp, members of the horde doing their best to get out of the way.\n\nLike cavalry charging through a line of infantrymen, the elite cluster moves through the horde with ease. You and Paxson on the other hand, do your best to swim upstream. Each body, each barbarian that you \u201cpolitely\u201d move out of the way are replaced by several others. The camp is in uproar. Rushing bodies, men shouting, the stench of war is in the air. Off in the distance, you eye their destination. How could it be elsewhere?\n\nInstead of a tower, gazing over the army, providing a vantage and symbol over their troops, the Warlord\u2019s destination appears to be dug directly into the earth, tomb-like, a labyrinth for the dead. A small set of stone steps lead into an equally simple structure, one that protrudes from the ground like a shark fin in the water. The entryway is an open black space. Several more white and black elite soldiers stand guard outside, waving their arms to allow the Warlord through and underground.\n\n\u201cHow do you suppose we\u2019ll follow them in there?\u201d Paxson whispers, wondering aloud.\n\n\u201cThe direct approach?\u201d you answer, rhetorically.\n\nShaking his head, but not disagreeing, Paxson answers. \u201cGods.

The Warlord and Joren inside, most of the ushering elite soldiers remain outside. A small burn, more surprising than painful, ignites at your inner arm. Your tattoo, the mark of the Lady, glows softly not unlike it did on the night of Tristrand\u2019s navy arriving. The Lady is with you, invigorating, guiding your steps. You cannot fail now.\n\nThe guards outside, numbering almost twenty, feel the Lady\u2019s vengeance. You make them feel it.\n\nPower surges through your sword arm, cutting through the guards\u2019 defenses easily and efficiently. Their parries, blocks, and attempts to dodge are sluggish, like a great deal of wine was consumed beforehand. Openings, once never found, appear to you. You must be made to see.\n\nPaxson, next to you, does his best to engage with the elites. His skills were unmatched in the arena as well as the western front. However, these soldiers are on another level. Two keep him engaged, causing him to react more defensively than normal. Still, that\u2019s two less than fighting them alone. After making quick work of the nearest soldier, your sword slashing the back of his leg then meeting his neck, you move to flank those engaged with Paxson.

The other tribesmen seem too concerned with their rush.\n\n\u201cTrue, I\u2019m not being forced against my will. I had every right to travel back across the plains to the Helswith camp and report Tristrand\u2019s arrival. As much scrutiny as would be upon me, a slave being the lone survivor, High Lord Ursa isn\u2019t known for being unfair. After a few days locked up, he\u2019d likely send me back to my master as \u2018reward.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d you begin. \u201cFreedom is within your grasp. You could escape, southwest of the plains, into Orem\u2019s land. He\u2019s no ally of the Helswith.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but he will honor a writ from the Helswith. Master Arroden knows that is my homeland. It\u2019s the first place he\u2019d send bounty hunters to. And, there\u2019s a small matter of my wife. Your father is on the verge of locating and sending for her.\u201d\n\nDamn your father. It\u2019s a story you\u2019ve heard many times. Often, slaves have families before arriving at your father\u2019s school. It\u2019s been somewhat of a reused tactic by Arroden; he was using it when you were there. As far as you know, a reunion has never taken place. Seems it\u2019s still in place. No, now\u2019s not the time to disclose such information. Knowledge of illusionary bonds can be distracting before battle. You pray that your delayed honesty will be taken in good faith.\n\n\u201cAfter we end the Warlord\u2019s life, I vow to aid your search. Personally. We\u2019ll find her, Paxson.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Nameless.\u201d\n\nThe words in the current context stings, especially after your confrontation the night of Tristrand\u2019s navy arriving.

Stepping through the opening is like the shades of a window being closed suddenly; the light from outside instantly vanishes, causing your eyes to blink repeatedly in order to adjust. There\u2019s a small staging area initially in the structure. No guards are here, as they would have heard your skirmish outside and joined in to protect the entrance. A staircase leads down further underground, back and forth like switchbacks on a mountain trail. Along the way, soft light is posted, torches placed strategically on the walls for vision, like small fireflies on a moonless night.\n\n\u201cTake care to pace yourself,\u201d Paxson whispers. \u201cDon\u2019t need to exhaust our legs on the way down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d you whisper back.\n\nThe two of you start the climb down, finding a good speed that finds the balance between speed and exertion. The journey doesn\u2019t take too long. Not ten minutes later you find yourselves nearing the bottom. The final section of the staircase leads into a large cavernous room, which looks to be formed naturally. However, the Great Warlord must have built directly into the natural rock.\n\nRocky, dusty ground has been replaced with smooth white stone blocks, the walls and ceiling mirroring. There\u2019s still enough of the cavern to tell its original shape, but it looks like the inside of a cathedral placed underground. Varying sections of the sanctuary have jagged rock poking through the white stone, like icicles built from pure rock, giving the otherwise holy place of worship a dark feel to it, sinister, unseen dangers of the void peering through the veil. Across the sanctuary, framed by two large statues of past warriors holding battleaxes, the Warlord sits casually on the floor, back facing you, an elite soldier on either side.\n\nAbove him, strung into the air like a fly caught in a web, is Joren suspended between the two statues, rope binding each of his four limbs stretching them out in a starlike shape. The Warlord sets a golden cup down on the floor, echoing throughout the chamber, and you realize noise travels exceptionally far in the stone enclosure. You take great care to move silently, still pressing forward to reach your target, while also listening to hear the words spoken from his mouth.\n\n\u201cNow what am I to do with the likes of you,\u201d the Warlord wonders aloud. \u201cA treacherous high priest is no small matter. You will be made an example of, of course.\u201d\n\nAs you draw closer, using jagged sections of natural rock for cover, you notice a wound at the Warlord\u2019s side. Looks to be made from a small dagger if you had to guess. Joren turned on his leader? The man seems to have a pattern of attacking those closest to him. Finally, he\u2019s been caught in the act.\n\n\u201cMy travels have shown me that tyranny cannot stand. Freedom is each man\u2019s right. I\u2019ve been bound, traded as a slave, but I finally recognize you for what you are: a tyrant using our own religion and tradition for your gain. At least my slave masters had the common decency to tell me what I was, not feigning free will and twisting our religion for their gain.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking, Joren attempts to call on his holy fire, blue flame, the wake of destruction you followed several territories. Nothing.\n\n\u201cHa, you think I would string you up with normal rope? You give me far too less credit, priest. The spirit being\u2019s power is almost within my grasp. Perhaps a sacrifice will grant additional favor and manifest his power in me completely. I\u2019m sure it will, considering your betrayal to that whore, the false god who delayed his return so many years ago.\u201d\n\nDoes he mean the Lady? Is Joren following her ways? No, he killed Killian and burned the temple on the island. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s on the same path as you. Still, the Warlord\u2019s words bring you to pause a moment. So Uralan isn\u2019t fully manifested in the Warlord yet. Good. You need to end things before it is. You\u2019re close to the Warlord now, so close that a minor scuffle on the ground would alert him of your presence. You motion to Paxson, telling him to stay put. The direct approach has gotten you this far; your training on the island would have to carry you the rest of the way.\n\nSilently, sneaking in a crouched position, you do as Morgan taught you so long ago on the island, limiting the surface area of your feet on the ground, light in your step, using the strength of your legs to absorb the impact of your steps. You breathe a sigh of relief, figuratively as not to alert the Warlord, that you didn\u2019t rush down the long staircase to get here. Blade drawn already, you move forward. Amateurs don\u2019t draw until the last moment. That\u2019s why they\u2019ll forever be known as such. Draw your blade early. Even the smoothest of sheathes give a slight sound when pulling weapon from a resting position.\n\nUp close, the Warlord is a brute of a man, far from the eloquent speaker you heard speaking to the horde. Well, perhaps, he\u2019s both, but the ruggedized man before you looks anything but eloquent. His head is bald, highlighting a bull-like neck, thick and muscular. He doesn\u2019t appear to be wearing armor. A black cloak hangs from his shoulders, and a chiseled arm extends from beneath it. The Warlord still sits, one knee in the air, leaning on an arm while the other holds a golden cup. His two guards are stoic, silent, ever watchful.\n\nA few more steps now. Blade raised. Neck exposed. Your path takes you from cover. Joren, noticing, the only one facing you, does his best to hide his surprise. Still, though, it shines through. Something\u2019s off. The Warlord senses it. He turns just as you plunge your blade directly into his neck.

Her eyes, two black orbs, stare directly ahead past you. You turn, finally noticing your surroundings, the Lady taking the bulk of your attention until now. You\u2019re back in the chamber, one that holds a small stone altar, flowers at its base. It\u2019s the place you first met the Lady, the place where she first bestowed her mark upon you.\n\nThe coffin that you\u2019re used to seeing is gone. Instead, the Great Warlord lays on the altar. Blood pours from his two wounds, one at his side and another in his neck. Strength rapidly lost from his limbs, he\u2019s at the Lady\u2019s mercy, something that she\u2019s not known for. Mercy doesn\u2019t come easy for the spirit of vengeance.\n\nFour flames, candles lit on each of the altar\u2019s corners rise in luminosity as the Lady floats closer. Her bare feet travel mere inches above the steps leading to the Warlord. Next to her, you float, watching the scene unfold before you. As she draws closer, the candles burst with light, like a forest fire spreading in the night. Flames dancing, your eyes travel to the Warlord\u2019s shadow.\n\nUnlike its human origin, the Great Warlord\u2019s shadow is not reflective of humanity. A beast, clawed, with a snout-like nose appears in black behind the Warlord\u2019s body. Two sharp tusks extend from its mouth, a great and terrible beast: the form of Uralan. The shadow rises high, reaching far higher and lengthier than the Warlord, like the long shadow cast from the setting sun. Trapped, laid on the Lady\u2019s altar, Uralan\u2019s shadow howls. Piercing noise emanates from the Warlord\u2019s mouth, primal, enraged, otherworldly. The Lady doesn\u2019t react. A blank expression coupled with firm eyes watch the man in front of her. It\u2019s the look of vengeance, a dutiful approach to the word.\n\nYour return will not happen this day, fiend, she speaks. My herald has stopped you. Face it, you\u2019ve been beaten again.\n\nThe Great Warlord\u2019s body thrashes on the altar, seizing like a man possessed.\n\nALL THIS HAS HAPPENED--\n\nAnd will happen again, the Lady finishes.\n\nYOU HAVE NOT BEATEN ME, MERELY DELAYED MY PLANS. YOU ARE NOTHING. A FALSE GOD. AN OUTSIDER WELCOMED IN BY MY WEAK BROTHER. A WHORE THAT HE WANTS TO FUCK. HE\u2019LL TOSS YOU ASIDE ONCE HE\u2019S DONE WITH YOU, LIKE HE DID TO ME.\n\nYou betrayed the Eternal Father, not the other way around. Your attempts to overthrow him have brought chaos in the mortal realm. I was once one of them, transformed with the Eternal Father\u2019s power. You do not know the strength that lies within them, the steadfast willpower mankind is capable of. True, they are destroyed easily; their bodies naturally decay on their own. But still, they resist you. Still, they will not be pushed aside. Their lives may be scarred with tragedy, but still they press on, undeterred of the future and their likely demise. The Eternal Father knows this. We can learn from them. Their doomed nature brings promise and hope. Ours, on the other hand, is a perpetual state of existence, blank, meaningless, unchanging.\n\nTHIS CHANGES NOTHING. EVEN NOW, MY FOLLOWERS ATTEMPT TO BRING ME BACK. MY POWER WILL MEET HUMANITY, DARKENING THEIR BLOOD, BESTOWING MY POWER UPON THEM. A NEW BLOODLINE WILL BE ESTABLISHED. MY CHILDREN WILL RULE ALL NATIONS. A DYNASTY WILL RISE, AN EMPIRE GUIDED BY MY POWER. THEIR RULE WILL BE ABSOLUTE, THEIR LINEAGE, UNBROKEN.\n\nEnough. I tire of your empty threats. Herald, step forward.\n\nYou do as the Lady commands.\n\nEnd it.\n\nYour blade pierces the Great Warlord\u2019s heart. The shadow of the beast cast from the Warlord\u2019s body, disappears for a moment, then surges into the air, fading from view, extinguishing the candles along with it. Smoke in the air, warmth overcomes your body. The Lady\u2019s hand turns your head to face towards her. She remains silent, your gaze falling over her flawless features. A nose perfectly shaped, skin unblemished, sparking eyes black as onyx, womanly curves filling the edges of her ceremonial dress. Her face draws closer, hands cupping your jawline. Her eyes shut, lips meeting yours. Similarly to Uralan\u2019s shadow, the Lady fades into nonexistence, her touch a small spark still upon your skin.

Joren\u2019s lies in the air, still suspended with rope in the middle of two ancient statues, ones that disallow his holy power to shine forth. His throat is slashed, a red line across is skin in which a waterfall of blood pours down. The sanctuary, with its acoustics, echoes softly each time a drop pours from Joren\u2019s body to the white stone floor, a pool forming beneath him.\n\nCloser, the Great Warlord\u2019s body is absent of life, his two elite guards the same. Their deaths, however, show more signs of struggle. Several wounds line their limbs, blood from several areas spilled on the ground, scattered, unlike the neat pools displayed by Joren and the Warlord. Paxson sits in between both, nursing his own damage, although his doesn\u2019t appear to be fatal. Paxson, always victorious with scars to prove it.\n\nYou rush over to him, consciousness back in your body, to examine the damage sustained. As you draw closer, his wounds look much more serious than at first glance, partially because he\u2019s hidden them underneath his wooden shield. It\u2019s bad. A deep gouge lines his side, the contents of his torso barely visible through the opening.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you learn to use that buckler of yours?\u201d you ask, trying to lighten the moment.\n\n\u201cYou know I can only take the direct approach,\u201d he answers, wincing at the pain.

Morgan, dropping down from an overhanging section of rock, lands next to you. She holds a dagger in her hand, still wet with blood. Joren\u2019s, if you had to guess.\n\n\u201cMorgan! (Liliana!)\u201d both you and Paxson speak simultaneously, then quickly eye one another at using a different name, surprised at each other\u2019s recognition.\n\n\u201cMorgan,\u201d she answers, confident as always. Stern, like a schoolmaster addressing students. \u201cLiliana is no more. Her death is the reason why I breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d Paxson begins, before entering a fit of coughing. He spits a large amount of blood from his mouth to the white floor, far too much for your liking. His eyes turn glassy, like they are unable to focus on a single target, blurry, fading.\n\n\u201cLiliana was weak. Liliana was vulnerable. Liliana got taken advantage of,\u201d Morgan says, striding up to Paxson\u2019s body. She eyes his wounds, knowing full-well it\u2019s only a matter of time. \u201cShe could no longer be allowed to live. Her sacrifice means my survival.\u201d Morgan gently grabs behind Paxson\u2019s head, forcing his focus to be on her, something that he\u2019s lost the ability to do himself. \u201cShe loved you until the very end. Even now, from behind the veil, she loves you, despite the choices of her stupid husband.\u201d\n\nPaxson opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out. His vision, distant. Slowly, you see the strength exit his body. The power he possessed, gone. A man unhindered by wounds, setbacks, obstacles has finally met one he can\u2019t overcome. His grit, the drive that kept him going for so long. His honor, brings him to this moment. A man marked by, bound by his word tighter than any shackles, breathes his last breath. A man not soon forgotten. Morgan kisses his forehead and rests his head against the stone floor, shutting Paxson\u2019s eyelids.\n\n\u201cSo, you and him\u2026\u201d you trail off, realizing this is not the time or place for such discussion.\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d is Morgan\u2019s reply.\n\nYou join Morgan next to Paxson, crouching next to her. He looks at rest, his reunion complete. Your arm wraps around Morgan\u2019s shoulders, pulling her closer to you. Despite her typical emotionless, blank demeanor, you notice a single tear fall down her cheek. Liliana may not be as dead as she previously stated. Paxson, far too honorable for your father\u2019s house, lies dead, his time spent in servitude believing the lies of your father, Arroden Scholhart. The wrong man lies dead.

You\u2019ll likely not have a chance like this again. The Lady said she\u2019d be there when you need her, perhaps she orchestrated things behind the scene to set up the Warlord\u2019s vulnerability. One thing\u2019s for certain, you\u2019re not going to let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Paxson following, you start to make your way to the front of the assembly, getting a few angry looks from several tribesmen along the way.\n\nAlong the way, the Warlord\u2019s voice rings out over the crowd, somehow projecting a great distance. Magically enhanced. It\u2019s not what you were expecting from the man. You expected it to be more...rough, animalistic, but it\u2019s smooth, the words spoken with an eloquence that rivals a master orator.\n\n\u201c...the people of Helswith have lived high and mighty for too long. Comfort has crept into their veins, poisoning the host. They rest on fine silk and speak poorly of the laborman, the very men who make their society possible. No, they must not be allowed to continue, not while spitting in our direction.\u201d\n\nYou draw closer. Still, a fair distance away. Barely audible, especially compared to the Warlord\u2019s voice, another rings out. Seems their assembly is a two-way road. Progressive, for savages.\n\n\u201cThen why have we been sitting here? We should have marched months ago!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not the right moment to strike. The spirit being was building his strength within me. Striking without his aid would be folly,\u201d the Great Warlord answers.\n\n\u201cBut now it is?\u201d\n\nThe Warlord smiles, a curved thing like the edge of a scimitar. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nCloser and closer you get, meeting more barbarians who don\u2019t take kindly to you pushing past them. A few even give you a shove, which only angers others since it takes you into the back of another barbarian. It takes a little while, and by the time you get a clear view of the Great Warlord, you can tell the assembly is almost concluded.\n\nUnlike the men at his command, the Warlord is clean-shaven minus a thin black mustache that looks as if it was the result of a thin paintbrush. His head is bald, highlighting bull-like thick neck muscles. Surprisingly, he doesn't wear armor. Instead, he wears normal trousers, far too normal for his position, and a sleeveless vest, stitched with red, revealing arms that Helswithian sculptors could only imagine. He\u2019s also paler than you imagined. The western barbarians are typically darker skinned, since they spend most of their time outdoors.The Warlord looks as if he\u2019s spent most of his time indoors.\n\n\u201cThe signs are before us! The spirit being speaks to me in my dreams. His power is made manifest through me, and subsequently, you. And who should share in our glory? My long lost high priest has returned, a holy man who is instrumental in our cause.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re almost within striking distance. Below the stage, a line of more equipped barbarians stand guard, shields and spears at the ready, their colors black and white. Unlike their fellow tribesmen, these don chain and steel helms.

Paxson\u2019s. \u201cI have a bad feeling about this,\u201d he whispers. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re about to do, this is a one-way journey. I hope you know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d you whisper back. The black and white shields lie before you, a cliffside meant to stave off the most powerful of waves. Behind them, two men to kill. The eyes of the elite guard scan the horde, searching for signs of danger, seeking disruptive behavior. You take off in a dead sprint directly toward them.\n\nThe sudden movement draws all attention to you, the few assembly members in front of you part, retracting like the receding of a wave. You murmur a soft prayer to the Lady, pumping your arms and legs, propelling yourself forward at full-speed. Despite being surrounded by a hundred thousand men, all seems quiet. The only sounds registering in your mind is your breath and footsteps. A wall of shields raise against your charge. You leap.\n\nFlight. Wind rushes past you like howling gales. The hairs on your arm rise, partly because of fear, partly because of adrenaline. You acknowledge both within a thought and press onward. Your flight is only a matter of seconds, maybe less, but it feels as if an eternity. The world slows down around you, allowing you to see. You must be made to see.\n\nThe eyes of the elite guard are steadfast, confident with their shield wall. As your leap takes you higher, they shift. Realization falls across them, surprise at your flight path. The whites of their eyes, behind steel helms, follow your body upward, momentarily frozen. Before they can recover, your foot lands on one of the shields, propelling yourself higher, sending you directly onto the stage in front of your victim. Joren.\n\n\u201cHello, old friend. Been awhile,\u201d you say, throwing your dagger at Joren. Whirling, it flashes through the air towards the exposed neck of your prey. It lands within Joren\u2019s neck with a soft thud. A small gurgle escapes his lips simultaneously. Behind you, Paxson engages the Warlord\u2019s guards, a single man surrounded by well-armed and well-trained soldiers. In an instant, you know how it will end. It would likely have the same outcome even with Pralthar\u2019s greatbow at his support. You feel a pang of guilt, but do your best attempts to suppress it. There\u2019ll be time for that later.\n\nThe thick neck muscles of the Warlord bulge, his body posturing for combat. His eyes draw down to your arm, where the tattoo of the crow lies. \u201cYou!\u201d he speaks. He charges forward, a mad bull stampeding. At the last moment, when he\u2019s almost upon you, your feet shift drawing you away from his charge. Surprisingly quick, too quick for a man of that size, he adjusts, slamming his massive shoulder into your gut. It\u2019s like being hit with a solid rowing oar. The impact shoves you back, taking a flight path in the air opposite of the one you just took. Your body collapses near the edge of the stage, almost falling over completely.\n\nCrumpled, dazed, you eye the approaching Warlord, his heavy boots resounding on the wooden stage with each step, like thunder within a storm cloud. In the circle of soldiers, Paxson\u2019s success is on par with yours. Several cuts line his arms and legs. Blood pours down one side of his face from an unseen wound, only worsening his vision for what\u2019s to come. Still, he holds a defensive posture, unwilling to accept defeat while he possesses strength. Like you, he knows what the outcome will be. The longer he distracts the soldiers, the greater your own chance of ending the Great Warlord.\n\nYour hand grips tighter around your sword. You\u2019re not done yet.

Your vision starts to darken, like a pair of heavy eyelids before sleep. Twisting, whirling, the world around you suddenly fades from view.\n\nLightless you float, becoming more used to flying in the air during your time spent in visions. Stone blocks line the floor, walls, and ceiling. It looks as if the same stone from your initial meeting with the Lady, the place where the coffin lies. Warmth falls over you, like waking up with the morning sun across your face. She\u2019s here.\n\nYou will yourself forward, traveling down the torch-lined hallway. You pass each torch, an orange streak of light, growing quicker and quicker. Soon, the light of each torch molds into one, a single beam of warmth on either side of you. Wind greets your face and your stomach turns as if falling from a great height. Perhaps you were overconfident in your abilities in this realm, wherever \u201cthis\u201d is. Then, like running into a thick brush, you\u2019re stopped, trapped, suspended into the air. The torchlight around you extinguishes as one, sending wisps of smoke in the air with the final breath of light.\n\nThrough the darkness, a green glow appears, a pale face emerges. The woman flocked by crows. The vengeful spirit. She approaches her herald. Her youthful face is unmarked, flawless. In contrast with you, it makes her even more beautiful, a broken man in the presence of a goddess.\n\n\u201cYou promised to appear when I need you most,\u201d you say, filling the hallway with your voice.\n\nYes.\n\n\u201cAnd here you are.

Pour your strength into me?\u201d\n\nThe Lady turns away from you, head seemingly buried in thought, tilted slightly.\n\nI am not like Uralan. He was born of this realm. I was brought into it. He can siphon off strength to others. For me, that would be crippling. The power that keeps me in this realm would dissolve with the transition. I would be cut from the other deities.\n\n\u201cThen my actions have doomed us,\u201d you answer softly. \u201cI should have waited, not charged the man in front of his entire army.\u201d Your body floats down to the stone floor. Somehow, you\u2019re able to command yourself to stand normally, feeling the solid ground beneath you. The Lady follows.\n\nYou continue, bowing your head. \u201cI ruined our chance. Paxson will die because of me -- the Reapers already have. Morgan is lost. At least the vengeance of your destroyed temple is complete. I set off from the island to end Joren\u2019s life. That was accomplished. I\u2019m sorry that I could not complete the rest.\u201d\n\nHer feet land on the floor next to yours, the first time you\u2019ve seen her have any physical contact. Even her own hair seems to float just above her shoulders, never touching completely. Now, however, it falls heavy. Her hand touches your chin, drawing your gaze to meet hers. The Lady\u2019s eyes are black, yet inviting. Somehow, comforting despite possessing endless darkness.\n\nI chose you because I knew you could make it this far. Your strength lies not in your physical body, but in your willpower. You have made it this far. Allow me to carry you to the end.\n\nYou fully understand the meaning behind her words. Her strength, though able to pour into your body, would remove her from her place next to the Eternal Father. She would no longer live with the gods. Her sacrifice would end her life. All because of you.\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t do this,\u201d you utter.\n\nWhat\u2019s done is done, she answers, drawing closer. Her face comes mere inches from yours, examining, contemplating. Her lips rise to meet yours, passing through as if an empty cloud. Then, she\u2019s gone. You\u2019re alone. Still, with your feet firmly planted on the ground, you stride forward, not sure what else to do. Usually, the visions are ended for you. This time, it\u2019s sustained. Your journey takes you to a single doorway. As you approach, the door swings open inviting you inside.\n\nYou\u2019re met with a familiar room. Simple stone steps leading to an altar. A coffin lies on top. In each of the four corners of the altar, candles are lit, shining their warm light on a row of colorful flowers placed near the coffin. Once more, you approach the coffin. Its lid, formerly firmly in place, rests on the floor next to the altar, allowing you to view the body inside.\n\nThe Lady rests inside, flawless features absent of life. Her dark eyes lie closed, forever. Two small hands cross at her waist, resting softly on her simple ceremonial robes. The Lady, the one flocked by crows, lies dead because of your choices.

A mistake on her end.\u201d\n\nHeavy boots stomping on the stage platform, he commits to a series of aggressive strikes, long powerful swings and slices, not the disciplined quick thrusting of a Helswith soldier. Sheer brutality and ferocity are his allies, and they\u2019ve seemed to carry him this far. Speed, strength, perception, yours are enhanced beyond human limitations. With the Lady\u2019s power, it\u2019s like a seasoned soldier play-fighting with a child.\n\nBehind you, Paxson lets out a shout. You turn just as a tribesman pulls a spear back from his thrust, one that caught Paxson cleanly through the shoulder. Blood. More blood splashes onto the ground, most of which is Paxson\u2019s. Glancing back, you know what you must do. The Lady sacrificed herself for you. Many have died because of you. Death follows you, child. Her words echo in your mind. You will not allow Paxson\u2019s name to be added to the list.\n\nYou will yourself forward, in the same way as your visions. In an instant, your body transforms into a flock of crows, squawking, flapping their wings at deafening levels, each with eyes black as the Lady\u2019s. Not a second later, you arrive at Paxon\u2019s side, turning back into your body. Paxson\u2019s gaze meets yours, hand still clutching his fresh shoulder wound, one of many that line his body. Not a word is shared. Like you\u2019ve done many times before, you engage the tribesmen together.\n\nYou move as a blur, avoiding each axe, spear, and sword, finding openings with each swing of your sword. Part of you wonders how long you can sustain such movement. So far, you haven\u2019t shown any signs of slowing down, so you push the thought from your mind. Every barbarian you fell is replaced by another, sometimes two others. Paxson holds his own, using a defensive posture, simply aiming to survive and distract as long as possible, while you take the offensive. You need to move. And fast, looking at Paxson\u2019s accumulated wounds.\n\n\u201cSurround the assassins! I want them alive!\u201d the Great Warlord\u2019s voice rings out over the horde.\n\nWhile already surrounded, the tribesmen cluster closer together. Instead of solely attacking from all angles, they become a tight-knit force, meaning to enclose you from all sides. They draw closer and closer, prodding, poking, jabbing with their weapons. Paxson, delirious from blood loss, stumbles, his vision blurring, instincts taking over conscious actions.\n\n\u201cThey will make a worthy sacrifice to the spirit being. The spirit will bless our attack -- urghh!\u201d\n\nThe Great Warlord\u2019s words are cut short. The point of a sword sticks out from the front of his thick neck, flashing in the sunlight. His mouth freezes open in surprise, a trail of blood leaking from within.\n\nAll stands still for a moment.\n\nThe surrounding tribesmen stop their assault, hundreds of thousands of eyes fixated on one point. With a thunderous crash, the Great Warlord falls dead, face-first, on the stage. A small woman stands in his place, originally covered from view by the Warlord\u2019s massive frame. Unnaturally black hair, emerald eyes. Morgan. Her head motions to one side, signaling to run. You don\u2019t need to be told twice.\n\nPaxson, losing strength, can hardly stand. You scoop him up over one shoulder and will yourself to the stage, to Morgan. Black wings flap in the air, taking you to your desired location. Emerald eyes greet you upon arrival. Your other hand, the one not holding Paxson in place, wraps around Morgan\u2019s waist, pulling her close. You will yourself forward.\n\nYou travel far. A flock of crows fly over the western plains. Your vision is a blur of passing grassy hills, occasionally passing by jagged trees, void of leaves or life. Inside the flock, you\u2019re able to see perfectly through the crows, although you\u2019re sure no one on the outside can look within. Your journey takes you all the way to the coastline, relatively near where the Reapers made their camp, though miles away in case more of Tristrand\u2019s ships arrive.\n\nEventually, you land on the bluffs overlooking the sea. Three sets of feet stand on the ground, one pair badly bloodied. Morgan eyes Paxson, taking far more of an interest than you would have expected, especially after revealing your newly found ability. His body, drained of energy, lies prone on the ground, resting in recovery, his heavy breath indicating sleep. You\u2019ve bandaged his wounds best you can, and are confident in time he will heal back to full. There isn\u2019t a more durable man you know.\n\nMorgan doesn\u2019t speak at first. Perhaps for the first time, around you at least, lost for words. It\u2019s oddly silent, save for waves crashing against the shore. A soft breeze blows in the air, causing her to tuck her loose strands of black hair behind an ear.\n\n\u201cShe chose you,\u201d Morgan finally breaks the silence.\n\nYou nod.\n\n\u201cI thought she would choose me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought she would too,\u201d you answer. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d\n\nMorgan sighs. \u201cIn all honesty, I was after Joren. But you beat me to it. You seemed to be making quite a mess of things, so I had to clean up like always.\u201d\n\nDespite her light-hearted comment, you answer solemnly. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. The Lady sacrificed herself for me. She foretold her own death. She would still be alive if not for my actions. She should have chosen you.\u201d\n\nAbsent of emotion, a blank expression falls over Morgan\u2019s face, like a mask hiding the true feelings underneath. It\u2019s a look you\u2019ve seen many times at the island, one that is accompanied with lesson teaching.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll not have you disrespect her like that. The Lady made her decision, and questioning that decision is questioning her judgement. I\u2019ll not allow such blasphemy, especially from you. She lives on through her herald, just as the ancient texts speak. I\u2019ve...we\u2019ve trusted her this far, and have we been given a reason against that? No. Things rarely play out as we imagine. Just ask my former husband there. You and I have plenty of work to do. First starting with building a new temple and reestablishing the order. You will lead us, Herald. May the Lady\u2019s vengeance continue through you.\u201d\n\nMorgan finishes by dropping to one knee, bowing her head before you. Well, that\u2019s strange. The woman who you\u2019ve known only to discipline and reprimand you -- wait, did she just say husband?\n\nPaxson continues to breathe deeply, eyes shut. Peacefully dreaming of other times. His face is caked with dried blood. Smaller wounds not large enough to need wrapping, have since stopped bleeding, showing early signs of scabbing. The man who stayed loyal by your side, despite your father\u2019s ownership, despite countless wounds and blows on the battlefield, rests softly. His past, deeply aligned with your own. If you and Morgan are to reestablish the order, you can think of no better member to include. Besides, a little refinement around the edges would be good for him, although you imagine he\u2019ll still prefer the direct approach.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d you say, pulling Morgan up by her arm. Her words resonate with you. She\u2019s right. Both she and Paxson have demonstrated that you can\u2019t wallow in the past, fixating on past mistakes. You share a burden, a responsibility to continue the Lady\u2019s work. Your mind draws back to her words. All this has happened and will happen again. Victory is yours for the time being, but it will not always be so. You need to prepare for the future. You can start with building a temple and training new members.\n\n\u201cThere is a place,\u201d you speak. \u201cdeep in the Mountains of the Nameless, hidden from most travelers. The sun rises each morning between twin peaks, shining its light down evergreen-filled mountainside. There sits a rocky slope, a jettison in the mountain as if the top was cut cleanly off. I spent time there after escaping my father\u2019s house. No one\u2019s settled there. It is a perfect place to rebuild.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you wish, Herald,\u201d Morgan answers with a smile.\n\nNext to you, Paxson rests silently. His chest rises and falls with each breath. Finally, he looks at peace. Finally, he\u2019s free. The coastline wind blows, sending nearby dry grass leaning eastward. Sunlight, shining from the ocean, sparkles brightly with the ocean\u2019s movement. You take in the moment, knowing that soon you\u2019ll be back in the comforting caress of the mountains, back home. Strange how the arc of one\u2019s life can come full circle. All this has happened and will happen again. Asleep, Paxson dreams of better times. A life of violence, separation, pain, the only solace comes during sleep, during dreams of her. Past glories mean nothing. Future glories are simply stepping stones on his journey back to her embrace. When he wakes, he\u2019ll find her.\n\nThe End", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Rise to standing", "result": "He\u2019s on top of you as soon as you finish the roll. Armed now with a curved blade, he brings it down in a powerful overhead swing, sending splinters flying from the stage as it narrowly misses. You bring your own sword to counter. It meets the Warlord\u2019s cloak, bouncing off harmlessly, not making a mark. It has the same effect as a small dagger trying to slash through plate. On his next assault, you attempt to kick out his legs from under him. The Warlord hardly notices, absorbing the blow, and returning his own, which sends you sprawling across the stage again.\n\n\u201cThis is the strength of her herald?\u201d the Great Warlord comments, drawing closer to your fallen body.\n\nYou try to cut his injured leg, but he easily avoids the attempt, slapping your sword from your hand. You try to hold on to the blade, but it feels as if it was torn from your hands, like the rigging in stormy sea water.\n\nA man cries out behind you, followed closely by laughter. Paxson. You turn to see his prone body, pierced with several spear wounds. He moves, barely. Not for long, though. Not until the tribesmen have their fun. The Warlord\u2019s fist smashes into your nose, bouncing the back of your head on the stage. The heel of his boot stomps on your knee with a sickening crack, like a tree branch being snapped into two pieces. Pain. Searing pain shoots up your leg distracting you from your surroundings. There\u2019s only one focus on your mind. Pain. Searing pain.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have you escaping now, can we?\u201d he speaks again. \u201cYou\u2019ve made it this far, only to fail now. I suppose that\u2019s expected considering the Eternal Father tasked that whore to stop me.\u201d\n\nThe insult towards the Lady distracts you from the pain, briefly. You try another desperate attack, but get shut down instantly. The Warlord\u2019s boot meets your already broken nose, crushing it further. Your face a bloodied mess, you speak. \u201cThe Lady will have her vengeance. She\u2019s stopped you before, and she\u2019ll stop you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cFace it, Herald. You\u2019re beaten. Your death will serve no purpose other than to further the spirit being\u2019s return. His power made manifest through me. In killing the whore\u2019s herald, I will severe her ties to this world. Face it, Herald. You\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nThe Great Warlord lifts his curved blade up, ready to end your life in a single strike. Here, it all ends. You\u2019ve made it far, falling short near the finish line. In an instant, you find yourself full of sorrow, not because your life is ending, but because you\u2019ve failed the Lady. You\u2019ve failed to accomplish her task, one that she placed her faith in you for.\n\nThis is it. You close your eyes wanting it to get it over with. A sudden flash. Movement occurs. Sunlight fades for a moment, caused by a shadow passing over you. A woman stands above you, her back turned towards you. She engages the Warlord in a fury of strikes, like a swarm of hornets being disrupted in their hive. She\u2019s quick, too quick for the Warlord. But still, he holds a sizable edge due to sheer strength and size. Her swarm may be frenzied, spurred by vengeance, but she\u2019s ultimately outmatched in a direct confrontation.\n\nSeveral minor cuts appear on the Warlord\u2019s arms, but they are but a small nuisance. The guards and the horde stand at the ready, willing to come to their leader\u2019s rescue. The Warlord waves them back, preferring to handle the would-be assassins on his own. He creates a spectacle of it, a show for their benefit. This is not a leader standing idly back while others fight. He\u2019ll settle things on his own terms. He\u2019ll get his own hands dirty. He\u2019ll smother the Lady\u2019s vengeance.\n\nA woman falls next to you, blood pouring from her face, just as you.

Your back is pressed against a large wooden column, hands bound behind and around the pillar. Similar chains are clasped to your ankles, connecting to the base of the pillar like a dog leashed to its master. Thousands upon thousands of faces surround you, cheering, voicing animalistic sounds at your demise. The horde.\n\nIt\u2019s late in the day now. The sun is much lower in the sky than it was when confronting the Great Warlord. The strength sapped from your body, you must have laid unconscious for several hours. Morgan! Where is she? You twist your body the best that you can manage to see if she\u2019s near. She\u2019s not. You\u2019re alone, tied to the pillar. However, to your right, you discover Paxson\u2019s remains, a series of five pikes in the mud arranged in a star-like pattern, each impaled with one of his limbs, the fifth being his severed head.\n\nPaxson, an unlikely friend, loyal until the end, unwilling to stand by, idly, while you took a desperate attempt on the Warlord\u2019s life. He knew the outcome and still gave you support, trading his life so that you could have a greater chance at success. And still, you failed.\n\nBodies begin to part in front of you, creating a pathway for two figures to walk through. Like you, she\u2019s chained, led by the Warlord holding the leash. He pulls on it suddenly, cruelly pulling her forward, stumbling to the ground. Her clothes are tattered, torn in several places exposing the skin beneath, at least not directly where places are meant to be covered. Close, though. Very close. Black hair, unnaturally black, frames her face. Two emerald eyes peer through the curtain, absent of the brightness they once possessed. You recognize the look. Hopelessness.\n\nThe Warlord walks her up in front of you, tossing her once again to the ground. Morgan. The two of you have shared so much. It\u2019s oddly fitting that you find yourself here, sharing in the defeat as well. Her eyes meet yours, hands and knees still on the ground. She\u2019s void of the sharpness that once inhabited. The zeal that possessed her is gone, replaced with a sense of nothingness, a shell of her former self. Morgan\u2019s head turns slightly, catching sight of Paxson\u2019s severed body. For a moment, the light is back. Inner fire that burns away all else. As quickly as it appears, it dissipates, doused by the present setting. Was that recognition or simply a reaction to the cruelty?\n\n\u201cI had my men break her in for me,\u201d the Warlord speaks to you. \u201cShe\u2019s as passionate as they come. Eventually, though. They all break.\u201d\n\nYou attempt, unsuccessfully, to break from your chains. It\u2019s futile, but you have to try.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll keep her around a while. But first, you must be dealt with.\u201d\n\nThe Great Warlord motions to nearby tribesmen. They nod at his command, stacking pieces of wood around you and lighting torches. So this is how it all ends. Your life, once from the comfort of a prominent house, to the Mountains of the Nameless, to here, in the horde, is about to end.\n\nThe man you tracked across many nations is dead. That much was accomplished. But seeing Morgan in her position, in the vulnerable form you never expected to see her in, is heartbreaking. The man you chased, Joren, left a wake of flame in his path. His life ended, and yours about to be by the very burning tracks he left behind.\n\nSymmetry. The cyclical nature of your journey is not lost on you. Here, at the end, you find yourself where you once began. Shackled, your life in the hands of another. From a family that owned slaves, to becoming one yourself. The woman flocked by crows, stampeded, mistreated, shamed through a barbarian horde, Morgan following in her footsteps. Symmetry. You were born into this world screaming, crying. As they light the fire underneath you, you leave the world in the same way.\n\nThe End", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Warlord", "result": "The Lady tasked you with ending the Great Warlord, the return of Uralan. Joren may be the reason that brought you this far, but you\u2019ll not abandon the task that is set before you. She chose you as her herald, and you cannot betray her like that...even if it\u2019s in justice\u2019s name for the destruction of her temple. He\u2019s here in front of you. Exposed, thinking he\u2019s safe behind a wall of guards. His life is yours for the taking. You step forward, ready to end it here. Suddenly, a hand rests on your shoulder, stopping you. Paxson\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI have a bad feeling about this,\u201d he whispers. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re about to do, this is a one-way journey. I hope you know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d you answer, taking a second glance at the situation before you. A wall of black and white shields, a raised platform with two dangerous men, a horde unlike any other around you. Perhaps patience is the best avenue. As the Lady\u2019s herald, you must be willing to listen to others.\n\nThe Warlord motions, again, to Joren. \u201cStep forward, priest. Your return is a sign from the spirit being. Victory will be ours. At long last, we march on Helswith and the privileged Ursa. Your travels have taken you through the desert, priest. Do you have any insight to share with us?\u201d\n\nJoren\u2019s hazel eyes scan the horde before him. Most would be fearful in that position, speaking to thousands upon thousands of warriors. Leaders know how to inspire. They put their men\u2019s interest above their own, willing to place themselves in risky situations for the good of the company. Ever confident, like he knows a secret you don\u2019t, Joren takes a deep breath before speaking.\n\n\u201cMy travels have resulted in many things learned, Warlord.\u201d Confidence, even at not addressing the Great Warlord\u2019s full title in front of the horde. \u201cThere are those in Helswith that slander your name. They mock the tribes\u2019 gathering based on the inability to punch through the Helswith frontier line. Now, as we speak, High Lord Ursa is marching on our very position. He\u2019s taken the offensive. Something that many here would say we should have done.\u201d\n\nThe statement, and the obvious slander, brings a displeased look to the Warlord\u2019s face. Murmuring starts among the horde. Joren yells over them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been but a mere slave, chained, beaten, treated as but a wild animal. My bonds have taught me much about the way the world should be.\u201d Joren\u2019s hands blaze alive with holy flame, radiating blue light on his face. \u201cTyranny is everywhere, enforcing unfair rules, bending others to their will. The only way to live is through freedom. True freedom. A man is his own being. Anyone who says otherwise is a tyrant, a dictator, a WARLORD!\u201d\n\nBoth hands suddenly grip the Great Warlord\u2019s face, searing his skin with blue fire. The Warlord screams, frenzied, flailing his arms out meaning to catch Joren with his fists. The horde erupts in chaos. Tribe against tribe, savage against savage. Like a loose thread holding a pile of sticks together, they snap, the loose bond holding them, uniting them, broken. Through the chaos, you see the elite guard marching upon Joren\u2019s position. The bond between their master may be broken, but their honor will continue to be lost unless they can avenge their fallen leader.\n\nPaxson jumps to Joren\u2019s rescue, unaware of your history with the man. All he sees is someone ending the Great Warlord\u2019s life, an unlikely ally found in a horde of savages. Never one to passively wait for an outcome, he charges the platform where Joren stands. Reluctantly, you follow. Luckily, Joren is the main focus of the elite guard, allowing you to end a few, unaware, from their flank.\n\nPulling your blade from the back of a guard, dropping him, brings you face to face with Joren. \u201cYou,\u201d he utters, with a more surprised look than the Warlord just displayed at Joren\u2019s betrayal. \u201cYou just don\u2019t quit, do you?\u201d\n\nPaxson drops a guard next to you. \u201cYou know each other? Now\u2019s not the time for petty disputes.\u201d\n\nYou parry a blow, stepping back as another tries to catch you preoccupied. \u201cAgreed. Why don\u2019t you make yourself useful and give us some cover?\u201d\n\nJoren, understanding, nods, sending blue flame extending from his palms. The entire platform soon is covered in flame, black smoke rising into the air. In the smoke, you feel at home, drawing upon your training received on the island. Such smokescreens were part of what Morgan taught you, causing you to depend on other senses rather than sight alone. Joren, in the same situation, follows suit, both of you guiding a non-accustomed Paxson through the smoke cover, letting the chaos of the horde give you additional cover, and distraction, to leave the war camp.", "action_results": [{"action": "Into the surrounding hills", "result": "You flee, far from the war camp. The sun, originally high in the sky, slowly creeps towards the horizon. But still, you flee, putting as much distance between yourselves and the horde as you can.

For all you know, another leader could rise, bonding them together in their betrayal, uniting them for a sole purpose: to find and kill Joren. In your temporary position next to Joren, you hope that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s still a very real possibility though.\n\nHow is it that the man you chased several nations to kill became an ally, aligning his goal with your own? Yes, Joren is the reason for traveling this far, but the Lady\u2019s will directed you towards the Great Warlord instead. Confused at the outcome, questioning her decision to even task you with the assassination, you suppress the thoughts, meaning to focus on escape. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to answer those questions later.\n\nCool evening air washes against your face. The three of you, running on foot, finally rest, finding a large grouping of stones as cover. Each of you drop, planting your backs against a stone for support. The rock itself is cold, a result of being exposed to the air, while not receiving direct sunlight.\n\n\u201cJust couldn\u2019t get enough of me, huh?\u201d Joren breaks the silence, hazel eyes meeting yours. His brown curls have grown considerably longer than they were at the island.\n\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d you answer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still even, though. I could have escaped there by myself. Didn\u2019t need you and \u2018Scowly\u2019 over here to rescue me. If anything, I saved you with that smokescreen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you calling \u2018Scowly,\u2019 Mop Head,\u201d Paxson answers. \u201cI don\u2019t care about your past. You ended the Great Warlord\u2019s life, which puts you as a friend in my book.\u201d\n\nYou sigh, exhausted. You find yourself here, so might as well make the most of it. \u201cWhy? Why did you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Joren answers. Seeing your frown, he continues. \u201cOk, ok. Speaking plainly then. The one they worship is real. The woman flocked by crows, vengeful spirit. All that. She\u2019s real. I\u2019ve seen her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d you reply, directed towards the fact that Joren\u2019s spoken with the Lady. As far as you know, you\u2019re the only one she appears to. Morgan didn\u2019t even claim direct communication with her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. She came to me on the island. How much do you know of Killian? He was a false prophet, leading the order astray. He\u2019s actually part of the Dreamwalkers. The leader of the Lady\u2019s order was grooming up members to be taken by the Dreamwalkers for experimentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut...but you\u2019re a high priest for the Warlord, the direct enemy of the Lady,\u201d you respond.\n\n\u201cI was a high priest for the Great Warlord. All those things I said on the stage are true. The Warlord was a tyrant. He\u2019s just as those who put us in shackles, worse even as he feigns freedom for his followers. They\u2019re bound, and they don\u2019t even know it. Their chains follow them no matter how far they travel.\u201d\n\nSeeing your skepticism, he continues.\n\n\u201cI serve the divine, in all forms he takes. Once I thought that was the Warlord. Even after the island, I thought that. My journey told me otherwise. The Lady told me otherwise. Though I was once aligned to the western tribes, my only duty is to the divine. You are her herald. She told me as such. The herald must have a priest in accompaniment. One to fulfill her will, and the other to cultivate it. You know it must be this way. You and I are bonded, destined, to do the Lady\u2019s work. Together. \u201d\n\n\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d\n\nThe voice comes not from you, not even from Paxson, but from your left. Morgan stands between two sizable boulders, arm resting nonchalantly on them. Two emerald eyes framed by hair of unnaturally black hair.\n\n\u201cLiliana?\u201d Paxson utters, wide-eyed.\n\n\u201cMorgan,\u201d she answers, stepping forward. Something flashes in her eyes. Recognition? Whatever it is, it appears for only a moment, now suppressed. Morgan dons her blank, expressionless face, the one that accompanied many lessons on the island.\n\n\u201cAh, Morgan,\u201d Joren begins. \u201cFitting you should be here as well. We\u2019ll need your--\u201d\n\nSubtle movement on the rock above where Joren leans against. Neither Paxson, Joren, and apparently, Morgan notice. Something\u2019s wrong. Then, realization hits you, like a strong wind current running into full mast sails. \u201cMorgan\u201d is an illusion, a projection. She stands where the sunlight barely hits the rock formation. No shadow. Her body isn\u2019t casting a shadow. The subtle movement occurs again. You\u2019re too late to stop it.\n\nThe real Morgan drops from above, blade ready, flashing, a silvery streak as she flies down. All eyes are focused on the woman in front of them, on \u201cMorgan.\u201d Her boots land directly on Joren\u2019s shoulders, one on each, the sudden blow dazing him. Morgan\u2019s free hand grabs a handful of curly hair, pulling Joren\u2019s head up to expose his neck. She eyes him for a split-second, savoring the moment, ready to enact the Lady\u2019s vengeance. Hazel eyes meet a pair of emeralds.", "action_results": [{"action": "Reach out", "result": "You must be made to see. Taking a deep breath, you draw on the power that the vengeful spirit instilled in you. Your arm starts to tingle, like static energy is in the air, small hairs starting to rise on themselves. Dizziness takes over, the world spinning into a blur of color and images, pouring in on itself like a swirl of clouds taking the red-orange light from a sunset. Blackness appears at the edge of your vision, growing large, finally tunneling your vision into a single point of light.\n\nA woman appears, emerald eyes within a curtain of blonde hair. Dressed in simple brown work clothes, her hair is a mess, loosely tied behind her head. She struggles to carry a bucket of feed, slop for the farm animals. She grips the bucket in front of her, both hands on the U-shaped handle. The bucket is dumped in entirety with each pen she crosses, causing the woman to journey back to refill its contents. You count six pens in total, a sizable amount for a family, let alone, a lone woman.\n\nThe farm is surrounded by trees, much too many to be in the Helswith or the western plains. The land mass itself is far too large to be one of Tristrand\u2019s islands. Wherever you are, it\u2019s a place you\u2019ve never been. Southwest of the barbarian plains maybe? As the woman finally finishes feeding the animals, several figures emerge from the treeline. They\u2019re dressed in red tunics with bright chainmail underneath. Orem\u2019s soldiers. The laws say she\u2019s to provide food and shelter for those in support of their king. The same law took her husband away from her, off to war with mere weeks of service left. That was three years ago. Their reason for arrival obvious, the woman, Liliana, sighs and begins meal prepping.\n\nAn hour or so later, she places four plates of food on the table for the hungry soldiers, recognizing only one of them, though Liliana doesn\u2019t recall his name. Roast pork with a side of stew and bread, a specialty of hers. It always was well-received by Orem\u2019s men. The fact that the warm stew and its heaviness made the soldiers sleepy is simply a bonus.\n\nThose who escaped the war, or at least had a break from it, liked to indulge in their ale, and Liliana didn\u2019t want to put up with their rowdy behavior. At first she chalked it up to blowing off steam, but then she slowly realized it was much more: it\u2019s the action of scavengers, men who take all that they can, dressed in Orem\u2019s red. The burden of responsibility, of attending to one\u2019s duty is absent. Instead, it\u2019s men forced into service, those who seek escape above all else. A tankard of ale is a temporary escape, but it does the trick for the time being.\n\nAfter the soldiers finish, Liliana takes their plates from the table for cleaning. Unlike some, these ones actually thank her for the food. Others assume it\u2019s her duty to serve them. Whether actual gratitude or simply being polite, either one is fine with Liliana.\n\n\u201cLodgings, Miss?\u201d their sergeant asks, a balding man with scruff appearing at his jaw.\n\n\u201cNo extra rooms. Sorry,\u201d Liliana answers. \u201cThere\u2019s soft hay in the barn to use. It\u2019s not much, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s better than being out on the road.\u201d After thanking her, the four soldiers leave, full and drowsy, to rest for the night in the barn. So Liliana thought. She wakes up. Darkness. Heavy footsteps. Floorboards creaking. Powerful arms hold her down. She struggles. Pain.\n\nThey\u2019re gone the next morning. Memories echo within Liliana\u2019s mind, recurring events from the previous night. Her helplessness. A strong grip around her. Breath. Gods, that fucking awful breath. Pain. It lingers, a constant reminder, one that will not be easily shaken from her mind. Liliana goes through her daily routine as if everything\u2019s normal. First the squawking chickens, then the swine.\n\nShe pours herself into the work, feeling the strain, sweat, and exhaustion set in. The animals here are grateful for her food. They don\u2019t...no, strike it from memory. Keep to the day. Don\u2019t let them take anything more than they have already. She almost forgets about it, the day\u2019s work thankfully filling her thoughts with pressing tasks that need completing. Until evening rolls around, and four figures, again, emerge at the treeline. Orem\u2019s law. She has to give them a place of rest. The law, however, does not cover...what they did. What they continue to do. Another four meals. Another night of pain.\n\nThey don\u2019t even acknowledge their wrongdoing. They simply pretend it never happened, like the light of day washes all evil from the night before. She doesn\u2019t forget, though. How can she forget? Still, the soldiers put up their polite facade, giving them deniability with each as a witness for one another. Maybe they don\u2019t even know. Maybe it\u2019s only one of them, sneaking into the night, hurting her. No, they must know. They have to know.\n\nNightfall. Creaking floorboards. Footsteps heading for her door. Staggering steps, affected by the ale. She gave them a generous amount, hoping it would lay them to sleep for the night. Not enough. Heavy hands holding her down. She anticipates the pain.\n\nA flash of light, followed closely by a burst of red. The thin point of a blade appears in the dark, reflecting moonlight shining through the bedroom window, like a guiding star in the night, one that Liliana instantly promised to follow. The dark shape atop her falls to the side. Standing behind, blade in hand, is a man with hair like snow. Pure white. He gazes at Liliana, concern in his face as if the loving look of a father.\n\n\u201cWill the lady extend her vengeance to the others?\u201d the man speaks, a soft whisper in the night air.\n\nLiliana nods, a loose strand of blonde hair falling in front of her face. Blonde hair, like a young girl innocent of the world of men. No more. She would have to change that, and she knows just the color. Black, like the night, to remind her of her helplessness. Black, to signify the hearts of men. First, the others must be attended to. Then her transformation would be complete.\n\n---\n\nA fist crashes into your nose, sending you sprawling to the ground. Paxson stands over you, visibly angered. Behind him, rests the dead body of Joren, countless stab wounds pouring blood from his chest, Morgan holding the dagger. Joren\u2019s blood is splattered across Morgan\u2019s face and clothes, a large pool starting to form underneath his body.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Paxson demands, still towering over you.\n\n\u201cMe? Nothing. It was Orem\u2019s soldiers\u2026\u201d you answer.\n\nAnger washes from Paxson\u2019s face, fragmented memories pieced together like a puzzle. He knows the laws of his homeland.

First of all, it\u2019s on land. He much prefers the soothing creaking of The Seaspell, the comforting sway of the ocean. The plains are firm. Marching on solid ground isn\u2019t something he\u2019s used to. It\u2019s not something any of them are used to. Their home is the sea, but Rotha, along with his crew, are loyal to King Tristrand, and they will follow his every command...even if it brings them on solid land.\n\nHe\u2019s well aware of the importance of his mission. It\u2019s on him to breach the gap between barbarian and his king. A new agreement will be set into motion by his hand, acting as proxy for Tristrand. It would mean great things for their nation. It would free up a major portion of the king\u2019s spending to build up their defenses and promote other arts within their waters. The people of the Helswith were taking advantage of them. They assumed King Tristrand had no other option but to deal with them as if their king was limited by their greed. Still, it was a little unsettling to deal with these...savages. Guess you truly get what you pay for.\n\nWorse yet, his men, a crew of King Tristrand are forced to camp on the outskirts of the barbarian horde. When Rotha invites an important guest aboard The Seaspell, he always offers them the finest quarters. It\u2019s about respect. Then again, these may be the finest \u201cquarters\u201d the horde can offer. On second thought, being the centerfold of the camp makes Rotha more uneasy. True, he\u2019s exposed being on the outskirts, but given a choice between here and surrounded by savages, he\u2019d stick with what he\u2019s got.\n\nThe captain sits outside his tent, leaning back in his chair using a stone in the ground as a footrest. His tricorn hat is placed on his knee, revealing his sandy hair tied in a loose knot at the nape of his neck, the loose strands tucked behind his ears. He has the luxury of privacy, something his crew can\u2019t boast, but he needs to feel the open air. At least then he can pretend it\u2019s the breeze of the sea.\n\n\u201cCaptain Rotha, sir!\u201d\n\nRotha turns to meet the voice. Three of his crew stand before him, matching royal uniforms, none of them high enough rank to wear breastplate. Young lads, them. Not five years older than when Rotha first joined the navy.\n\n\u201cWhat can I do for you boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we still have the freedom to enter the horde\u2019s camp?\u201d\n\nRotha peers an eye at the voice. \u201cYes, sailor, but I would refrain from using that term around them. Same goes for \u2018savage\u2019 and \u2018barbarian.\u2019 Use \u2018warrior\u2019 instead. Their leader, the Great Warlord, is extending full hospitality.\u201d\n\nThe three of them glance at one another, obviously excited, although attempting to keep a stoic demeanor of a soldier.\n\n\u201cMight I remind you though,\u201d Captain Rotha adds. \u201cthat you\u2019re still on duty and partaking in acts unfit for a sailor will result in reprimanding.\u201d Lowering his voice, he continues. \u201cThese may be our new allies, but that does not mean they are not a threat. Just because the blade isn\u2019t brandished, doesn\u2019t mean the hand still holds the hilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Captain Rotha, sir!\u201d three voices reply in unison.\n\nRotha watches them leave, by far the most eager of his crew to be here. Unsurprisingly, the youngest too. Around him, the rest of the crew, his seasoned sailors, look to relax and recover from their hike. Rotha was glad they asked for permission, but according to ship\u2019s rules, they have every right to indulge during their \u201cprolonged landing,\u201d usually in effect when a ship needs repairs. It\u2019s not a bad thing for men to blow off steam when confined to a boat for large amounts of time. If their new partnership includes more prolonged landings, then he\u2019ll have to do something about the rule.

You roll over to hide the tattoo with your body and drift off to sleep, fully expecting to find yourself face-to-face with the Lady.\n\nInstead, you find yourself face-to-face with a pike, illuminated by the blue glow of the moon.

A nod of his head brings a blow across Pralthar\u2019s face from the nearest soldier in blue. \u201cHelswith and Ursa have grown too confident for their own good, treating my lord as if a common trader. Each year, prices on Helswithian goods increase and increase, attempting to bleed my king dry. You Helswithians are all the same.

Those of you with quick reflexes fight back, even felling a few of Tristrand\u2019s men, but there are too many of them.

The main room of the inn is empty, something tells her that\u2019s its natural state. There are far better places to stay in this city, ones that are similarly priced too. With discretion prioritized over fine ale and room service, Sea Breeze is the perfect place for the two of them to stay.\n\nSoft glows of red-orange peer over the horizon, brighter than a normal sunset due to the reflective ocean spread out in front of the city. In the distance, crews work to secure their ships for the night. From Morgan\u2019s vantage point, they look like little ants working in unison. A breeze of cold air rushes past Morgan, touching the exposed parts of her skin, signaling night is quickly approaching. The inn is aptly named. Briefly admiring the sunset, Morgan heads down the windy road.\n\nShe spotted it when first arriving in the city. The temple, built on the tip of the crescent-moon city, rises high, overlooking the water. Its construction is simple. It\u2019s long and rectangular, four pillars standing above the rest of the structure like an upside down bedframe. Light stone blocks, obviously imported, create stability and strength, both symbolically and physically. No religious symbols or insignias are displayed out front. All are welcome here. Two double-doors lead inside the temple, reinforced with metal at the base and top. The doors are propped open, allowing citizens to come and go as they please.\n\nMorgan strides inside. The interior is candlelit. Rows of pews fill the back of the sanctuary, where the doors are, stopping halfway down the room. Two men, sitting in the pews, silent in prayer, don\u2019t even acknowledge her presence. From there, mats and pillows take over, leading to an unmarked altar. Without decor, or anything signifying a specific religion, the altar, instead, looks like a stone coffin. Morgan walks the length of the sanctuary and sits on the mat closest to the altar.\n\nShe takes a deep breath of air, softening her eyes, feeling the rush through her nose, the expansion of her chest, the slowing down of time. She lets the breath leave slowly, deliberately, drawing the exhale into a lengthy maneuver. Morgan then notices her hands are tightly balled into two fists, her fingers clenched tightly together. She relaxes, feeling the tension release, similarly to her breathing pattern.\n\nLady, have I failed you? she silently prays. A temple to no god stands, while yours lies charred, broken, and crumbling. How is it that everything can change in an instant? In one moment, strength lies within our grasp, and the next it\u2019s fleeting through our fingers like sand spilling through an hourglass. May your spirit, its vengeance guide me. Allow me to correct this wrong. Give me the strength, the willpower to defeat your enemies. By tradition, I know I\u2019m to assume the role of teacher.\n\nMorgan hesitates to continue, but does so anyway.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I can lead. I\u2019ve always been better at caring for myself. But now? I\u2019m to take the responsibility of the man marked by your very hand? I pray for wisdom in the endeavour. Only by your protection will this order survive. Appear to me, give me a sign, and I will follow your will.\n\nSilence. It\u2019s always silent after her prayers. Once upon a time she expected a sign or vision to guide her, to appear after her prayers, but it\u2019s always quiet, a one-way affair. Unless the man paired with her now is--\n\n\u201dWhat\u2019s a pretty woman like you doing alone? It\u2019s dangerous to be out during the night.\u201d\n\nMorgan turns to find the two men, first in the pews, standing behind her. So that\u2019s why the temple is sparsely populated. Darkness lies outside, seems the sun had finally disappeared completely during her prayer.\n\n\u201cWere you kicked by a horse? What does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d Morgan sharply answers.\n\nHer response earns a chuckle from the one on the right. \u201cHeh, heh. She\u2019s got spirit, this one.\u201d He takes a step toward Morgan. \u201cI like a little spirit.\u201d His hand grips Morgan\u2019s arm. She lets him grab her.\n\nThe other man steps forward. Close up, his nose is crooked, likely the result of a bad break, literally and figuratively. The back of his palm trace down Morgan\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019ll be quick, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be free to go after we have a little \u2018fun.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as a couple of marathoners,\u201d Morgan answers, still held by the arm. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s a quick sprint to the finish line.\u201d\n\nThe back of the man\u2019s palm removes itself from her face, drawing back in the air, stopping for a brief moment, then catapults itself towards Morgan\u2019s cheek. She sees it coming. Her instincts scream at her to move, almost taking over completely, but she wills it to silence. Silent, like her prayer. The blow strikes true, snapping Morgan\u2019s head back, which would have caused her to fall to the floor if not held by the other man. The blow, the resonating sound of skin on skin seems to excite the men. Satisfied at her inability to escape, the man holding Morgan\u2019s arm tosses her to the floor, on the mat where she just prayed.\n\nBoth of them, at once, jump on top of her, one holding her arms, while the other her legs. She throws a haphazard kick, unsuccessfully, which only spurs the men on with greater zeal. Fingers grab at her body, meaty things, touching parts of her meant only for a lover, grabbing forcefully, slapping, pinching.\n\nThe woman flocked by crows, the vengeful spirit. Her beauty drew the attention of men such as these two. She spent years suffering as the Great Warlord\u2019s plaything, shamefully providing her body to every desire of the man, no matter how painful, no matter how wrong it felt. If this is the cost of drawing close to the Lady, to understanding her greater, Morgan will gladly pay it. She trusts the Lady\u2019s will. The man at her legs starts to pull down her trousers.\n\nNo.\n\nMorgan explodes into movement, sending her heel into the man\u2019s groin and using the back of her head to smash into the other man\u2019s nose, by the sound of it, causing another break. Planting her palms on the floor next to her ears, Morgan swings her legs over her head in a backward handspring, landing on her feet.\n\nShe grabs the man clutching his nose, pulling him by the back of his shirt, dragging him towards the altar. Struggling, his feet kick out, not able to find a solid footing on the floor. Morgan\u2019s hand tenderly appears at his cheek, and she flashes a smile towards the man. The tenderness disappears, transitioning into a vice-like grip. She smacks the other side of his face into the stone altar, leaving behind a crack and spot of red. Again. The crack deepens, more red appears. Again. Again. Again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re...you\u2019re a madwoman!\u201d the remaining man shouts, starting to scramble towards the open doorway. His foot slips on one of the floor mats, sending him sprawling on the ground.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps the Lady is looking after me,\u201d Morgan comments to herself. At the mention of her god, the lighthearted comment is replaced with somber mood. I failed. I couldn\u2019t put myself through a fraction of the torment you endured, Lady. I promise I\u2019ll be stronger. Morgan makes for the double-doors, shutting them closed, then approaches the man.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be free to go after we have a little \u2018fun,\u2019\u201d she says, a smirk coming to her lips.

The barbarian horde gathers, sweeping through land dangerously close to the Helswith. It\u2019s not yet reached the borders of Ursa\u2019s land, but they\u2019re close. Damn close.\n\nThe journey took several weeks. Paxson, carted by a single man, finally arrived at the military camp. The trip was not enjoyable. After all, he spent the entire time locked in the cage sitting behind the cart driver. The Helswith Desert sun beat on the open cage, bathing Paxson in constant heat, while the driver sat comfortably in shade, the cart sporting an overhang for the driver.\n\nThe nights were worse. Once the sun fell below the horizon, a wave of cold overswept the desert. Paxson, in the exposed cage, had a single blanket in defense against the environment. The driver, able to move beyond the cart, built a fire each night, always holding his open palms against the heat, occasionally rubbing his hands together for even more warmth, all in view of the cage as if mocking Paxson. Small interactions with the man told Paxson it was nothing personal, just a job, but still, being witness to an abundance of warmth, but being outside it\u2019s range, made the cold desert nights feel somehow even colder.\n\nFinally, though, Paxson reached the western military camp. Finally, he can warm himself with the heat of combat. He wasn\u2019t the only slave to arrive. He wasn\u2019t even the only gladiator to arrive. The offer presented to Arroden Scholhart was given to each man of prominence. Many took the offer, just as Arroden had. Not only was the man awarded with immediate revenue, willingness to support High Lord Ursa was equally as important.\n\nPaxson was assigned to the Reapers, an infantry unit in the High Lord\u2019s army. There, he learned the ridicule given to him wasn\u2019t due to his gladiatorial stature. The soldiers ridiculed anyone who they felt wasn\u2019t deserving of their station. Despite their aggression, Paxson understands their notion. They\u2019re citizens of the High Lord.

Ok, maybe not pure luck, but it wasn\u2019t intentional. An instinct took over, something uncontrollable and unintentional. How could you claim ownership of that?

She tosses it to the ground next to you and squats down, again, to stare into your eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going after that murderer. He\u2019ll receive a lot more than you did just now. Perhaps there\u2019s a small comfort in knowing it could be worse. In Killian\u2019s memory I won\u2019t end your life...but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to let you off easy.\u201d\n\nMorgan\u2019s dagger slams down into your thigh. Her face draws closer with her next statement.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve brought destruction along with you. I can only hope slowing you down will, too, slow down that which follows you. Think what you must, but this truly is a mercy.\u201d\n\nMorgan stands, leaving her dagger in your leg. \u201cAnd a generosity. Look, I\u2019m not leaving you unarmed.\u201d A small laugh hangs in the air. Somehow, you imagine violence is the only thing to cause such an outward display of emotion from that woman.\n\nShe leaves you alone, bleeding in the dirt. The only equipment provided is the dagger in your leg.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay put and address the wound", "result": "The pain continues. There\u2019s no use in trying to escape the island without addressing your wounds first. Morgan gone, you crawl in the grass, dragging your leg behind you, to a nearby boulder. Using it as a backrest, you examine the damage dealt. It\u2019s not good. Your nose makes a wheezing sound with each breath, and you can\u2019t put pressure on your leg. For the time being, you keep the dagger firmly planted in your leg. Until you find a way to stop the bleeding, it\u2019s better to leave it in.\n\nDarkness sets in for a moment. Panic sets in. You\u2019ve lost a lot of blood. You\u2019re going to need to address your wounds quickly. Time is racing against you. Around you, there\u2019s plenty of scrapwood, remains from the destruction caused by Joren. Doing your best to ignore the pain, unsuccessfully, you crawl over to the pieces of wood. At the base of the temple, among the ruins, soft warm glowing shines through the rubble. Small embers still burn, a result of the fire Joren lit. With your newly found wood scraps, you coax the embers into a sizable flame.\n\nNow, the hard part.\n\nTaking a few quick huffs of breath in preparation, you grab the dagger\u2019s handle and pull out the blade in one smooth motion. Blood pools out immediately, running down your leg dying your trousers dark crimson. White hot pain shoots through your body, your vision becoming faint. Got to act quickly. You place the dagger in the fire, blade among the flames. There\u2019s nothing to disinfect the wound -- what you would give for a strong drink right about now, for both your leg and your senses.\n\nConfident in the blade\u2019s temperature, you draw it from the fire. Your vision fades for a moment, again, blood loss starting to affect you more severely. It has to be done if you have any chance of survival. You press the flat side of the dagger against your wound. Your vision, fading black, lights up for a brief second in a burst of pain. You release a scream from your lips, anything to help numb the pain. It doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s too much.\n\nYour hand, losing its strength, drops the dagger from your palm. It lands on the grass next to you. The words from your dream echo in your mind. Death follows you, child. It didn\u2019t take long to catch up.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Move to escape the island", "result": "The damage is bad. Real bad. You need to address the wound, quickly. The nearby jungle offers protection and resources. Here, in the middle of the burnt remains of a camp, you\u2019re exposed and without supplies. Morgan said there were no others in the order. Still, the thought of someone else discovering the location, and your vulnerable state, isn\u2019t a place you want to find yourself. No doubt there are ships searching for the one lost at sea. Others arriving here is a very real possibility. Best to keep moving.\n\nFirst, address your leg wound. You rip your shirt, starting from the neckline all the way down to the bottom. Fashioning it into a tourniquet, you steady yourself for the hard part. Nearby, you see a broken tree branch, a little smaller than your wrist, and you crawl over to it. It\u2019s a little wide, but it\u2019ll serve its purpose. You bite down on the branch and pull the dagger from your leg. Blood immediately begins to flow from the wound, staining your trousers red in a burst of fluid.\n\nScreaming, you bite down harder on the branch, attempting to channel the pain through clenched jaw and screams. Before too much blood is lost, you tie your makeshift tourniquet around your leg and wait for the initial shock to pass. Minutes you sit, trying to take your mind off the pain, unsuccessfully. Eventually, you reach a point where the pain persists, but it\u2019s manageable enough to stand. You have to keep moving.\n\nYou half limp, half hop to the treeline, meaning to find a safe shelter and pathway to the beach in the case a ship arrives looking for the one lost at sea. The jungle floor is hard to get through. Twisting vines and roots lie in your path, causing movement to be slowed even further. You press on, however, and--\n\ncome face to face with a man. He looks as if a beggar, beard and hair both unkempt, dirt marking his face and body.\n\n\u201cWell hi there, fellow traveler,\u201d the man says with a grin. Eyeing your leg, he continues. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look good. No it doesn\u2019t. Oh dear you\u2019re losing too much blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ship...crashed,\u201d you reply, feeling the effects of blood loss and exertion.\n\n\u201cThat it did. And I imagine Killian took you into his ranks?\u201d\n\nThe mention of the snow-haired man momentarily distracts you from the pain.\n\n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d the beggar says, pointing to your arm and the missing skin displayed. \u201cI have a good idea what used to be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d you utter, the effects of your wound reappearing. \u201cNeed to stitch this up.\u201d\n\nThe beggar, again, answers with a smile. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to help you. Doesn\u2019t do much good to study a dead specimen. Well, not as much good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, hush. Killian mentioned the war, didn\u2019t he? You, my formerly tattooed friend, just found yourself on the wrong side of it. We haven\u2019t had a live one for years now. The others will be happy. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be just a nuisance, traveling with a leg like that.\u201d\n\nWhistling the man, bends down looking at the ground, moving dirt and twigs with his palms searching for something. \u201cAh, this will do,\u201d he speaks to himself. Standing back up, you see a small rock is resting in the palm of his hand. \u201cThis will go a lot smoother if you don\u2019t struggle. The same goes for when we\u2019re back at the facility.\u201d\n\nNot that you can offer much of a struggle in your current state, you completely ignore his words, throwing a labored punch in his direction as he approaches. The beggar easily ducks under and smashes the side of your head with the rock. It doesn\u2019t knock you out at first, but two more blows do the trick. The horrors that you will awaken to, that have become your reality, are best not thought about. The beggar is right, however, struggling doesn\u2019t do much good.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}]}, null]}]}]}, null, null]}, null, null]}, null, null, null]}]}]}]}]}, null]}]}
